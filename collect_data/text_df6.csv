0,"First, Pete Souza became an Instagram celebrity by documenting the White House. Then he became an even bigger one by criticizing it. The former chief White House photographer for President Barack Obama, Mr. Souza has been developing a huge following on his Instagram account since the early days of the Trump administration. That is when he began posting nostalgic photos from the Obama era that, because of their captions and Mr. Souza’s timing, also read as sly commentary on President Trump. People caught on, and Mr. Souza, who also spent more than five years photographing the Reagan White House, became the subject of numerous media headlines lauding his “shade-throwing” skills. While he declined to comment about Mr. Trump at the time, Mr. Souza kept the visual digs coming. Now he is adapting his strategy into a book titled “Shade: A Tale of Two Presidents.” The book, scheduled for publication on Oct. 16, is intended to be a “portrait in contrasts,” according to a news release from the book’s publisher, Little, Brown and Company. In it, Mr. Souza’s photography will be juxtaposed with “tweets, headlines, quotes and other material from the first 500 days of the Trump administration.” The contrast, Mr. Souza said in an Instagram post announcing the book, is meant to express his concern over “the future of our democracy” by framing the current presidency through a look at the previous one. Mr. Obama “respected democracy and the rule of law,” he wrote. “Unlike his successor, he respected the office of the presidency.” "
1,"[Jessica Walter has died at 80. Read her obituary.] Perhaps no moment better defines “Arrested Development” than a recent attempt by Tony Hale, who plays the high-strung, blissfully immature (and one-handed) Buster Bluth, to set up a promotional clip on “Conan.” “I don’t even know how to explain this,” Mr. Hale said. The show, created by Mitchell Hurwitz, has always been difficult to characterize. The zany, self-referential sitcom tracking a narcissistic family as they dodge the claws (or hook!) of justice was critically adored when it debuted in 2003, but failed to build an audience over three seasons on Fox. It remained a cult favorite, its disciples ever clamoring for more banana stands, stair cars, cousins in love and $5,000 suits (Come on!). But Netflix’s convoluted revival in 2013 left many fans cold. (Mr. Hurwitz recently re-edited those episodes.) Now it’s back for a fifth season — debuting May 29 — and there’s a cloud hanging over the Bluths’ model home. One of the show’s stars, Jeffrey Tambor (George Sr.), was accused of sexual misconduct on the set of “Transparent,” allegations he denied but that still resulted in his being fired from the show. When the accusations emerged, “Arrested Development” had nearly finished production; Mr. Hurwitz and the cast members expressed support for Mr. Tambor. This week many of the actors got together for a group interview about the new season, including Mr. Tambor, Mr. Hale, Jason Bateman (Michael), Alia Shawkat (Maeby Fünke), Jessica Walter (Lucille), Will Arnett (Gob) and David Cross (Tobias Fünke). In a freewheeling, at times emotional conversation that had the air of a family Thanksgiving dinner, the group candidly discussed Mr. Tambor’s behavior on set, reflecting in particular on the time he blew up at Ms. Walter, his onscreen wife. Ms. Walter spoke publicly for the first time about the incident, which Mr. Tambor first mentioned in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. "
2,"A federal regulator on Wednesday encouraged banks to offer small, short-term loans to people in need of emergency cash, the Trump administration’s latest relaxation of banking regulations and a rare moment of common ground with consumer groups that oppose payday lending. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates national banks, said it will start allowing banks to make small loans — typically in the range of $300 to $5,000 — outside of their standard underwriting processes. Joseph Otting, the agency’s leader, said the new guidance is intended to help extend banking services to Americans whose credit scores are too low to qualify for conventional loans or credit cards. Mr. Otting offered the example of the owner of a vehicle in need of immediate repairs who had few options other than seeking a quick loan from a check-cashing shop or even a liquor store. “It’s not like that credit demand went away, it just got displaced into the most expensive segment,” he said. “I personally believe that banks can provide that in a safer, sound, more economically efficient manner.” A handful of large and midsize banks, including Wells Fargo and Regions Bank, once offered so-called deposit advance loans that let customers quickly borrow small sums, which would typically be repaid from their next paycheck. The banks stopped making such loans in 2014, after federal regulators warned banks against providing products that “can trap customers in a cycle of high-cost debt that they are unable to repay.” "
3,"Through Sunday. Derek Eller, 300 Broome Street, Manhattan; 212-206-6411, derekeller.com. Nancy Shaver’s exhibitions often overload the senses. They are extravaganzas of stuff, colorful and tactile, mostly society’s castoffs recycled into forms that expose false binaries, like high versus low, form versus function, masculine versus feminine and art versus craft. Ms. Shaver operates simultaneously as artist, curator, hoarder and stylist. She is also an astute frequenter of flea markets, seeking items for both her work and her secondhand store, Henry, in Hudson, N.Y. Her latest New York show, at Derek Eller, demonstrates her complex proclivities with special clarity. Its title, “A Part of a Part of a Part,” suggests a parsing of her efforts. Some of the art is cobbled together from found materials or objects, most notably her signature wall pieces, called “Blockers”: little wood blocks, individually covered with paint, fabric, paper or wallpaper, and arranged into grids, which evoke projects ranging from quilts to scrapbooks to works by Piet Mondrian and Joseph Cornell. A similar process is achieved in a beautiful, porous sculpture, “Drawing #30 — Light and Air,” in which stacks of little thread spools evoke Brancusi’s “Endless Column,” in embryo. But Ms. Shaver also uses things as they are, frequently in large numbers, as in the ambitious “Collections — Love and Work.” It includes wooden drawer knobs; baby hats from China, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan; beaded evening bags; and a handmade snow shovel. (Duchamp, anyone?) "
4,"HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. — With the might of incumbency and New York State’s Democratic machine at his back, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo cruised to the nomination for a third term on Wednesday, as Hillary Clinton and other powerful friends touted his administration as a model for the state and, perhaps, the nation. For Mr. Cuomo, who effectively controls the state party, the endorsement was inevitable. But the rhetoric surrounding his coronation was geared to ratchet up enthusiasm for the governor, who is dealing with an unexpectedly prickly challenge from the left from Cynthia Nixon. And while Ms. Nixon dropped in here on Wednesday — shaking hands, doing interviews, and leaving before noon — the moment undeniably belonged to Mr. Cuomo, with an assist from Mrs. Clinton, whose support in the convention hall here at Hofstra University seemed little dimmed by her loss to Donald J. Trump in 2016. “Now more than ever, we need leaders who will stand up for progressive values,” Mrs. Clinton said, after reeling off a laundry list of Democratic priorities, from fighting climate change to fighting for the rights of immigrants. “Most of all, we need leaders who believe in producing results and getting things done, leaders like Andrew Cuomo.” Though not nominated by the party on Wednesday, Ms. Nixon, who drew less than 5 percent of the delegate vote, intends to collect petitions to appear on the ballot, and she is still gunning to defeat Mr. Cuomo in a Sept. 13 primary. “This is our party, too,” Ms. Nixon said of her and her progressive supporters. Wednesday, however, was dominated by Mr. Cuomo and his anointed allies, including Letitia James, who secured the party’s nod for attorney general, a position suddenly vacated in early May after the resignation of Eric T. Schneiderman, who has been accused of physically abusing several romantic partners. Kathy Hochul, the lieutenant governor, was also nominated for another term. "

Of all the questions hanging over Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, one stands out: How will President Trump fare in the end? Here are several possible outcomes. An indictment while Mr. Trump is in office would be the most aggressive option, but it has grown increasingly unlikely. In a series of Twitter posts about the Russia investigation, Mr. Trump repeated allegations that federal investigators had used spies against his campaign, and gave the supposed scandal a name: “SPYGATE.” In related news, a judge ruled that the president’s Twitter feed is a public forum and that he cannot block anyone from following him. ____ "
6,"WASHINGTON — The Senate gave final passage on Wednesday to a multibillion-dollar revamp of the veterans health care system, consolidating seven Veterans Affairs Department health programs into one and making it far easier for veterans to take their benefits to private doctors for care. The legislation, which passed 92 to 5, also expands popular stipends to family caregivers of veterans who served during the Vietnam War era or after. And it establishes a nine-member commission to study the department’s current infrastructure to determine where its health system should expand and contract. The comprehensive bill had been a year in the making, and ultimately won the support of Republicans and most Democrats. The House passed it last week, 347 to 70, and President Trump plans to sign it into law. The bill rounds out an ambitious legislative agenda on veterans issues that has bridged the administrations of President Barack Obama and Mr. Trump, and largely united moderates in both parties who set out to make major changes to the department after a 2014 scandal over the manipulation of data on patient wait times. Mr. Trump has already signed laws that make it easier for the department to remove and fire employees and for veterans to appeal benefits decisions, as well as a rewrite of the G.I. Bill for post-9/11 veterans. Wednesday’s vote is “the last piece of a great mosaic to reform the benefits for our veterans to make them contemporary with the 21st century,” said Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, the chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Dozens of military and veterans groups, including the largest congressionally chartered organizations, such as the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars, also touted the changes. But beneath the surface, deep mistrust remains over the Trump administration’s mission to increase the use of private care. Many of the largest veterans groups, as well as Democrats and some moderate Republicans, fear that the White House’s push to unfetter veterans’ ability to choose their care is a backdoor effort to tip the scales in favor of private medicine and to starve the federal government’s second-largest department and its vast government-run health system. "
7,"BETHPAGE, N.Y. — A week after President Trump used the word “animals” to describe dangerous criminals who enter the country illegally, he traveled to the epicenter of MS-13 gang killings on Wednesday to press his demands for tougher immigration laws. Robert Mickens, a grieving father, told the president that the murder of his teenage daughter by MS-13 members validated Mr. Trump’s crusade to eradicate the gang by shutting America’s borders to violent criminals. “Obviously, this is a very touchy subject because there is immigration involved,” Mr. Mickens said while his wife wept quietly by his side at a forum on Long Island organized by the White House. “America is based off immigration. Everybody who came here wanted the American dream,” said Mr. Mickens, whose daughter, Nisa Mickens, was killed in 2016. “The American dream is still there. But if you’re going to come here with acts of violence, you can stay in your own country with that, because we don’t need it here anymore.” The emotional moment came during a highly stage-managed event in which Mr. Trump came to Long Island for the second time as president to address the problem of MS-13 — a transnational gang that has ties to El Salvador and uses machetes to kill — and to insist on the passage of tougher immigration laws. Outside the Morrelly Homeland Security Center, both a large group of immigrant rights advocates and a smaller group of supporters for Mr. Trump chanted in a circuslike atmosphere. Inside the tight room of about 150 formally dressed officials, law enforcement officers and the families of five victims of the gang, the atmosphere was one of subdued defiance. "
8,"President Trump has asked for a sweeping trade investigation into whether autos imported into the United States pose a threat to national security, a move that could ultimately result in tariffs on foreign-made cars and further strain relations with global allies. In a statement released Wednesday evening, the Commerce Department said it had begun an investigation “following a conversation” with Mr. Trump. The announcement followed a statement from the president, in which he said he had instructed the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, to investigate imports of cars, trucks and auto parts “to determine their effects on America’s national security.” “Core industries such as automobiles and automotive parts are critical to our strength as a nation,” Mr. Trump said. In a separate announcement, the Commerce Department said that imports of passenger vehicles had grown from under a third of cars sold in the United States 20 years ago to nearly half today, while employment in the sector had declined. Automobile manufacturing has long been a source of technological innovation in the United States, and the investigation would consider whether the decline of the auto industry threatens to weaken the American economy by reducing research and development in cutting-edge technologies, the statement said. “There is evidence suggesting that, for decades, imports from abroad have eroded our domestic auto industry,” Mr. Ross said. The investigation, which will take months, will be carried out under the same legal statute that the administration used to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The statute gives the president broad authority to restrict imports that threaten national security. "
9,"NEWARK — Roberta Harrington, a retired nurse of the same vintage as Philip Roth, remembers a visit a year ago by Mr. Roth to his clapboard boyhood home, which she now lives in, on Summit Avenue. He recalled with pleasure the many times that as a child “he’d run up the stairs and come back down again” just for the fun of it and how he prized a cherry tree that was no longer there. That house, that quiet tree-lined street, that neighborhood, this treasured city was the setting of many of Mr. Roth’s novels just as William Faulkner set many of his stories in the region around his hometown, Oxford, Miss. Though Faulkner used the fictional name Yoknapatawpha County, Mr. Roth, who died Tuesday at 85, rarely bothered to camouflage Newark in any way. In his breakthrough debut novella, “Goodbye, Columbus,” his alter ego Neil Klugman, working at the Newark Public Library for a summer, is bewitched by the fetching and much better-heeled Brenda Patimkin. In “American Pastoral,” another Roth stand-in, Nathan Zuckerman, idolizes Swede Levov, the star athlete of Weequahic High School, a character based on the school’s real-life star athlete when Mr. Roth attended in the 1940s. His last novel, “Nemesis,” recalls the panic that enveloped his tightly knit Jewish neighborhood in 1944 when a polio epidemic maimed and paralyzed some of its children. Mr. Roth was regarded with Saul Bellow, John Updike and one or two others as the titans of American literature of the second half of the 20th century. He earned that regard, in part, by milking the everyday people, buildings, streets and mores of the humble Weequahic neighborhood and other city landmarks, often with palpable and wistful affection. “This passion for specificity, for the hypnotic materiality of the world one is in is all but at the heart of the task to which every American novelist has been enjoined since Herman Melville and his whale and Mark Twain and his river: to discover the most arresting, evocative verbal depiction for every last American thing,” Mr. Roth said when he celebrated his 80th birthday in Newark in 2013. "
10,"ATLANTA — Stacey Abrams, who won the Democratic primary for governor, was born and raised in Mississippi. But in many ways she is a product of Georgia’s capital city, which she once represented in the state House of Representatives. Atlanta is a place black people call a mecca — home to black colleges, black culture, black businesses and black political power. It is, in short, a city where a woman like Ms. Abrams — a Yale-educated, unapologetically liberal, African-American transplant — does not stand out at all. But now Ms. Abrams, the first black woman in American history to win a major political party’s nomination for governor, must run statewide in a general election against one of the two conservative white Republicans locked in a runoff battle. And the rest of Georgia is decidedly not Atlanta. While every Southern state has its liberal-leaning cities surrounded by conservative countryside — blueberries floating in tomato soup, as Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, once described Austin — the divide is particularly pronounced in Georgia because of metropolitan Atlanta’s immensity, its central role in the American civil rights movement, and the rapidly growing number of nonwhite people who have been choosing to live in the city’s sprawling suburbs, which were once destinations for white flight. The Georgia countryside certainly has swaths of racial moderation and iterations of conservatism that are detached from white grievance. But there are also political attitudes in rural Georgia, and ways of expressing them, that stand in stark contrast to a capital city that has long offered itself to the world as a beacon of racial comity. Rural Georgia is a place where the Confederate flag, for complex reasons, is still embraced by many white residents as a proud symbol of heritage. And some still display it as an overt symbol of white supremacy. "
11,"The Trump administration wants to streamline the process for exporting American firearms, a change sought for years by domestic gun companies as a way to increase sales. A proposed rule expected to be published in the Federal Register on Thursday would transfer jurisdiction of consumer gun exports from the State Department, where the licensing process is expensive and extensive, to the Commerce Department, which has a simpler application process. Publication of the rule kicks off a 45-day comment period, after which departments including State and Commerce will review corrections and suggestions and then send a revised draft to Congress before final publication. Gun industry groups said that the shift, which was first conceived during the Obama administration but halted after the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012, would pare down a bureaucratic process that currently discourages American firearms companies from sending their products abroad. Lawrence Keane of the National Shooting Sports Foundation called the proposal “a significant positive development for the industry that will allow members to reduce costs and compete in the global marketplace more effectively, all while not in any way hindering national security.” But critics of the proposal worry that American guns, including AR-15s and similar semiautomatic rifles frequently used in mass shootings, could more easily find their way into the hands of foreign criminals. Among the reasons: a change in the disclosure rules for certain sales. The State Department is required by the Arms Export Control Act to submit any commercial arms sale worth $1 million or more to congressional review. The Commerce Department has no equivalent mandate. "
12,"As many of New York’s top Democrats gathered on Long Island on Wednesday for the party’s state convention, one prominent Democrat was noticeably absent: Mayor Bill de Blasio. Mr. de Blasio, who holds one of the most recognizable political offices in the country, and who has traveled to Iowa and other cities and states around the country to promote progressive Democratic ideals, was apparently not quite as welcome in his home state. “There was not an invitation to play a meaningful role at the convention,” he said on Wednesday at an unrelated news conference in the Bronx. “I got a lot of other good things I can do with my time and so I’m not worried about it.” The mayor did not say why he thought he had not been given a significant role, but it seemed likely that it had to do with the main attraction at the convention: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who will formally receive the State Democratic Party’s backing on Thursday. Mr. de Blasio did attend the Democratic State Convention in 2014 and had a speaking role, but not a major one, said Eric F. Phillips, the mayor’s press secretary. But Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo’s relationship has grown much more difficult during that time. Over the last four years, the two men have been embroiled in a very public and nasty feud. As the state’s top elected official, Mr. Cuomo is considered the head of the New York Democratic Party. "
13,"The owners of the National Football League have concluded, with President Trump, that true patriotism is not about bravely standing up for democratic principle but about standing up, period. Rather than show a little backbone themselves and support the right of athletes to protest peacefully, the league capitulated to a president who relishes demonizing black athletes. The owners voted Wednesday to fine teams whose players do not stand for the national anthem while they are on the field. Let us hope that in keeping with the league’s pinched view of patriotism, the players choose to honor the letter but not the spirit of this insulting ban. It might be amusing, for example, to see the owners tied in knots by players who choose to abide by the injunction to “stand and show respect” — while holding black-gloved fists in the air. Or who choose to stand — while holding signs protesting police brutality. We look forward to many more meetings of fatootsed gazillionaires conducting many more votes on petty rules to ban creative new forms of player protest. Many players, African-American by and large, have been kneeling during the anthem since 2016, when the San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began sitting, and later kneeling, during the ceremony to protest racism and police brutality. Many football fans and team owners thought Mr. Kaepernick was showing disrespect for the flag, or even for the military, as though the Stars and Stripes were a battle standard and the football field a hallowed battleground. The owners responded in the grand old American tradition of blackballing people you disagree with. "
14,"After the school shooting last Friday in Texas claimed 10 lives, the incoming president of the National Rifle Association, Oliver North, blamed not guns but a “culture of violence” arising from violent movies and the like. North fueled that culture by working as a pitchman for a shoot-em-up video game, but never mind. Meanwhile, Dan Patrick, the Republican lieutenant governor of Texas, was even more imaginative: He blamed too many school entrances and exits, and liberal abortion laws that he claimed had “devalued life.” Really? Folks, look at Japan. Japanese kids relish the same violent entertainment as Americans, and abortion is widely available. Yet at most nine Japanese were murdered with guns across the entire country in all of 2016 — fewer than the 10 killed just last week at the Texas high school. One reason Americans in their late teens are 82 times more likely to be murdered with guns than their peers in other advanced nations is simply that we are awash with guns, some 300 million of them. Yet Congress and President Trump have been paralyzed in part because of the N.R.A. refrain: There’s nothing to be done! It’s us, not the guns. It’s hopeless! In fact, there’s plenty we can do. Here are modest steps consistent with the Second Amendment and public opinion: 1. Require universal background checks to see if a purchaser is a felon or a threat to others. The latest study finds that 22 percent of guns are obtained in the U.S. without a background check, and polls find that more than 90 percent of the public supports making these checks universal. Yet the federal government balks. "
15,"It’s not every day we start our discussion of current events with the president’s sex life. Well, actually, it’s gotten to be pretty frequent. But today we’re going to talk less about what Donald Trump does in bed and more about his efforts to interfere with other people’s intimate affairs. “When I ran for office, I pledged to stand for life. And as president, that’s exactly what I’ve done,” he told a cheering anti-abortion crowd Tuesday night. Abortion opponents like to call themselves “pro-life,” but the Trump administration has gone further than simply making it more difficult for women to terminate a pregnancy. Trump’s had a virtual war on birth control, beginning with an attempt to eliminate the rule that employer health insurance cover contraceptives. Now he’s built a Department of Health and Human Services that wants to promote family planning methods that involve … not having sex. And he’s come a long way from the guy who once told a national TV audience that he was “very pro-choice.” Although to be fair, that was way back in 1999, when he was still in his 50s and presumably hadn’t had time to work out a mature position on the subject. Ever since he came into office, Trump has been letting right-wing activists run federal family planning programs. They’re at war with Planned Parenthood, which doesn’t get any government money for abortions. But it does provide reproductive health services to an enormous number of low-income women under the federal Title X program. Under a  new rule, the doctors and nurses would have to refuse to even answer patient questions about how to terminate a pregnancy. That’s not going to happen and we’ll see this one in court. Meanwhile, clinics with very conservative views can edit down their information and eliminate any discussion of, say, IUDs. Or just restrict the conversation to abstinence. Yes, a Donald Trump presidency is pushing a no-sex agenda. Cue the irony. "
16,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said on Thursday that it would have second thoughts about a summit meeting between its leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Trump if American officials continued to make what the North considers threats against its leadership. The North Korean official who issued the warning singled out Vice President Mike Pence for remarks that she called “ignorant and stupid.” In an interview broadcast on Monday on Fox News, Mr. Pence warned that North Korea’s government could end up like that of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the former Libyan leader. Mr. Qaddafi gave up his nascent nuclear program in the apparent hopes of staving off Western intervention and sanctions, and of negotiating economic integration with the West. But little of that happened, and years later he was killed by rebels after he was weakened in a military action against Libya by the United States and its European allies. In a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency on Thursday, the North Korean official, Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui, referred to “unlawful and outrageous acts” by top American officials and said that Mr. Pence had made “unbridled and impudent remarks that North Korea might end like Libya.” Ms. Choe’s comment was the second time in a week that North Korea has threatened to withdraw from Mr. Kim’s planned summit meeting with Mr. Trump, which is slated for June 12 in Singapore. “As a person involved in the U.S. affairs, I cannot suppress my surprise at such ignorant and stupid remarks gushing out from the mouth of the U.S. vice president,” Ms. Choe said. “In case the U.S. offends against our good will and clings to unlawful and outrageous acts, I will put forward a suggestion to our supreme leadership for reconsidering the D.P.R.K.-U.S. summit.” "
17,"By blocking users on Twitter, President Trump has violated the First Amendment, a federal judge ruled on Wednesday. The lawsuit was brought by seven Twitter users — including a Texas police officer, a New York comedy writer and a Nashville surgeon — who claimed that Mr. Trump’s Twitter feed was an official government account and that preventing users from following it was unconstitutional. In her ruling, Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald wrote that the plaintiffs who sought to view and engage with Mr. Trump’s tweets alongside those who were not restricted were “protected by the First Amendment.” The judge, though, did not require the president or Twitter to unblock anyone. The number of users blocked from the president’s account @realDonaldTrump, which has more than 52 million followers, is known only to Mr. Trump, to those who have access to his account and to Twitter. On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Twitter said that the company would not comment on the ruling, and stressed that Twitter was not a party to the lawsuit on either side. The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which joined the plaintiffs in the suit, posted personal statements from some of them on its website, including one from Rebecca Buckwalter-Poza, a legal analyst from Washington. "
18,"HONG KONG — Canada has blocked a $1 billion takeover of a construction company by a state-controlled Chinese company over national security concerns, a rare move by a government that until now has largely welcomed such deals despite growing skepticism over Chinese money elsewhere. The government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said late on Wednesday that it stopped the deal for the Aecon Group, a construction company that helped to build the landmark CN Tower in Toronto, following a review that began earlier this year. The deal became politically charged after members of Canada’s opposition party raised concerns about Aecon’s access to government contracts — particularly in the nuclear power industry — and the Chinese company’s ties to the Chinese state. “As is always the case, we listened to the advice of our national security agencies throughout the multistep national security review process under the Investment Canada Act,” Navdeep Bains, the Canadian minister of innovation, said in a statement. A spokeswoman for Aecon said the company was “aware of the government’s decision and will be issuing a response in due course.” Chinese companies are increasingly facing hurdles as they go overseas to spread their wealth and acquire technology. Governments from Germany to the United States and Canada are pushing back, often citing national security concerns. "

20,"Marcus J. Molinaro, a moderate county executive from the Hudson Valley, was formally designated on Wednesday as the Republican Party’s choice to unseat Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a two-term Democrat, in November. His task will be daunting: The last time a Republican captured a statewide office in New York was in 2002, when George E. Pataki won his third and final term as governor. But Mr. Molinaro is no stranger to political upheaval; at 19, he was elected mayor of the village of Tivoli, making him the youngest such official in the nation. He then ascended to county legislator, state assemblyman and, finally, Dutchess County executive. As Mr. Molinaro addressed Republican committee members assembled at the party’s quadrennial convention in Midtown Manhattan, he quoted Theodore Roosevelt and reached across party lines to beckon to Democrats and independents — a necessity given that Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 2 to 1 in the state. But he also took care to rip into Mr. Cuomo, alluding to the presidential aspirations and transactional politics that have quickly become his favorite talking points. "
21,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo skirmished with a senior House Democrat on Wednesday in a bitter back-and-forth over his treatment of Hillary Clinton in the aftermath of a 2012 deadly attack on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. The striking exchange in front of the House Foreign Affairs Committee — over the security of diplomats abroad — came during Mr. Pompeo’s first Capitol Hill appearance since taking over the State Department. It bared the simmering but fierce partisanship on a House committee that prides itself on being among the most evenhanded panels in Congress. And it was a reminder that while Mr. Pompeo now largely projects an image of moderation as the United States’ chief diplomat, he was once one of the most partisan warriors in Washington. The hearing touched on a range of foreign policy issues and hot spots — including North Korea, Iran and South Sudan — and Mr. Pompeo displayed a deep knowledge on most subjects and candidly admitted when he did not know an answer. He came to the hearing with a “to do” list of 22 items that photographers captured. Ninth on the list was “Call Lavrov,” most likely referring to Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia. “Carlos Slim,” the Mexican billionaire, was the 11th item. "
22,"WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. came under fire from electronic privacy and security advocates on Wednesday after acknowledging that it has repeatedly exaggerated the number of locked smartphones and other mobile electronic devices it has been unable to access because of encryption, including in congressional testimony and public speeches. The miscount, which the bureau said was because of an inadvertent programming error in a system that gathered statistics from F.B.I. databases, was a significant embarrassment at a time when the bureau has been pushing for a legal mandate that tech companies build unlocking tools into such devices for law-enforcement access to potential evidence. Electronic privacy and security activists have opposed the F.B.I.’s push to mandate an unlocking mechanism — which the government calls “extraordinary access” and critics call “back doors” — saying it would make devices too vulnerable to hacking. Among those who seized on the disclosure to rain criticism down upon the bureau was Greg Nojeim, director of the Center for Democracy and Technology’s Freedom, Security, and Technology Project. “The factual basis of the F.B.I.’s arguments to weaken encryption has been called into doubt,” Mr. Nojeim said, calling for an investigation by the Justice Department’s internal watchdog. Kevin Bankston, director of New America’s Open Technology Institute, questioned the F.B.I.’s competence and trustworthiness on encryption. He, too, called for an inspector general investigation to determine “just how the F.B.I. could have made such a massive mistake on such an important issue, and repeatedly given false information in sworn testimony for Congress.” The F.B.I. said it was conducting its own “in-depth review of how this overcounting previously occurred, and how the methodology can be corrected to capture future data accurately.” "
23,"The N.F.L. tried to straighten up its messy bed. Now it will see how sleeping in it goes. After nearly two years of hand-wringing, the league’s 32 owners decided on Wednesday to overhaul N.F.L. policy on protocol for the national anthem. At their two-day meeting in Atlanta, the owners said that the league would allow players to stay in the locker room during the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” but said that teams would be fined if players “do not stand and show respect for the flag and the anthem.” Then there is this hammer: Those teams can then punish players however they see fit. “It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of N.F.L. players were unpatriotic,” Commissioner Roger Goodell said, explaining the need for the new policy. “We believe today’s decision will keep our focus on the game and the extraordinary athletes who play it — and on our fans who enjoy it.” Yet the rule change figures to go a long way toward pleasing no one — least of all the players. In a text message sent as the owners voted, George Atallah, assistant executive director for external affairs for the N.F.L. Players Association, made it clear the new rule was “not a compromise.” “We were not consulted or included,” he wrote. The league has set itself up to take criticism both from those who want it to require that all players stand for the national anthem — including President Trump — and those who feel the league is trying to silence players who have chosen that moment to protest social injustice. In a statement released after the vote, the players’ union said, “The vote by the N.F.L. club C.E.O.s today contradicts the statements made to our player leadership by Commissioner Roger Goodell and the Chairman of the N.F.L.’s Management Council, John Mara, about the principles, values and patriotism of our league.” The new protocol also may lead to a host of challenges and recriminations if players decide to test the limits of the rules, and their owners’ tolerance. Giving clubs the authority to punish players sets up a situation where players in Seattle or Philadelphia may have one set of workplace rules while those in Houston or Dallas may have another. "
24,"Stacey Abrams is flying high. The former Georgia state legislator secured the Democratic Party’s nomination for governor Tuesday evening, making her the first black woman in the United States to secure a major party’s nomination for governor.   Ms. Abrams’s triumph has been hailed as a potentially transformative moment for a party that is still searching for its soul in the era of President Trump,  but she still has a difficult road to securing a general election victory in a deeply conservative state. Georgia hasn’t had a Democratic governor since 2003. On Wednesday morning, just hours after her victory party in downtown Atlanta, Ms. Abrams spoke to The New York Times about her win, her vision for the state, what it means to be a “progressive” in Trump’s America, and her love of romance novels. Some responses have been edited and condensed. There’s obviously a historic aspect to this. You’re the first black woman to be nominated for governor by a major party. How does the weight of that history feel? I am humbled by the opportunity to, you know, sort of tile this ground for folks. But I'm also excited about what it means for everyone who has yet to see themselves reflected in leadership in America. And my goal is to make certain everyone has a seat at the table and that folks can see themselves and their values reflected in our government. Much has been made about how this primary was a bellwether for the current state of the Democratic Party. What do you think your win says about where Democrats are right now? "
25,"Seeking to end a political controversy that has embarrassed professional football, the N.F.L.’s team owners on Wednesday held that players could no longer kneel during the national anthem without leaving themselves open to punishment or their teams facing possible financial penalties. But the league also said the new policy would not force athletes to stand on the sideline during the anthem; it would give them the option of staying in the locker room during the pregame ceremony. Almost immediately after passage, questions arose about how it would be enforced. The policy is an attempt to find a middle ground on a divisive issue that has shaken the country’s most successful sport for nearly two years, beginning when the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick knelt during the national anthem to protest police violence against minorities and economic inequality. President Trump escalated the issue a year later as he attacked kneeling players as unpatriotic, a stand that is believed to have contributed to a decline in television ratings. [Ken Belson writes “the N.F.L.’s new anthem policy is bound to please only the N.F.L.”] Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the N.F.L., said the protests, which began in the summer of 2016, created a “false perception among many that thousands of N.F.L. players were unpatriotic.” He added, “The new policy will keep our focus on the game and the extraordinary athletes who play it — and on our fans who enjoy it.” But if the N.F.L. had hoped to quiet the debate, instead people on opposite sides appeared to dig in further after Wednesday’s announcement. Trump said he was pleased with the N.F.L.’s new policy, but said he did not think the players should even be staying in the locker room in protest. "
26,"For the past six years, Travis Brenda voted like nearly everyone else in his part of rural central Kentucky. In 2012, 2014 and 2016, he helped send Jonathan Shell to the State House of Representatives, re-electing him again and again as he eventually rose to House majority leader. He watched as Mr. Shell and other politicians failed to add meaningful dollars to public education, embraced charter schools and cut state services. Then over a few hours on March 29, Mr. Shell helped introduce and pass a surprise 291-page plan to significantly overhaul the state’s struggling pension system that the governor later signed into law. Suddenly, years of bubbling anger among state employees and teachers in Kentucky erupted in protests and chants at the Capitol, fueling a sustained backlash that helped lift Mr. Brenda to an unlikely victory on Tuesday night. Mr. Brenda, a first-time candidate and a math teacher, knocked off Mr. Shell, who had both name recognition and fund-raising prowess, by 123 votes in the Republican primary for House District 71. “We trust those we elected to do the right thing,” Mr. Brenda, 43, who teaches at Rockcastle County High School in Mount Vernon, Ky., said in an interview on Wednesday morning. “What we are seeing is that they are not doing the right thing.” In November, he will face Mary J. Renfro, a Democrat who serves on a local school board, in the general election in a part of Kentucky that President Trump easily won in 2016. "
27,"Gene Talmadge must be turning over in the grave. On Tuesday, Georgia Democrats chose an African-American woman, Stacey Abrams, as their party’s candidate for governor. And not just any African-American woman. Ms. Abrams, the former minority leader in the Georgia House of Representatives, ran as an outspoken progressive and was endorsed by, among others, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and the liberal group MoveOn.org. When Mr. Talmadge served as Georgia’s governor for three terms during the 1930s and 1940s, the Georgia Democratic Party was viewed as the defender of segregation and white supremacy in the state. After African-Americans began voting in large numbers following the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, Georgia Democrats like Jimmy Carter and Roy Barnes campaigned and governed as moderates and forged biracial coalitions that included a substantial minority of white voters along with the overwhelming majority of African-American voters. But in recent statewide elections, moderate Democrats have had little success in Georgia. Mr. Barnes was defeated in his bid for a second term in 2002 by a little-known state senator named Sonny Perdue (who is now the secretary of agriculture). That election began a string of Democratic losses running through 2016. Republicans now hold every statewide office, including both of Georgia’s United States Senate seats. No Democratic presidential candidate has carried the state since Bill Clinton in 1992. The Democratic strategy of nominating candidates who hoped to win over moderate-to-conservative white voters received its most recent test in 2014. In that year, Democrats nominated Jason Carter, the grandson of the former governor and former president, as their candidate for governor, and Michelle Nunn, the daughter of Sam Nunn, a former senator, as their candidate for the Senate. Both lost decisively. In her successful campaign for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, Ms. Abrams adopted a different strategy than that followed by Mr. Carter, Ms. Nunn and most Democrats who have run for statewide office in Georgia. While extolling her success in working with Republicans while minority leader, Ms. Abrams emphasized her progressive positions on issues like expanding Medicaid in the state, along with the personal challenges she had overcome as an African-American from a family of modest means. Rather than focusing on increasing the Democratic share of the vote among moderate-to-conservative whites, Ms. Abrams emphasized her ability to energize and mobilize young voters and the state’s growing nonwhite electorate. "
28,"WASHINGTON — After the body of Jesse Lewis, age 6, was recovered from his classroom at Sandy Hook Elementary School, his father, Neil Heslin, cradled him for a final time. At the top of Jesse’s forehead was the gunshot wound that ended his life. “It meant a lot to be able to see him,” Mr. Heslin said in an interview. “When he was born, I was the first to see him, and I was the last one to hold him.” Alex Jones, an online conspiracy theorist whose InfoWars website is viewed by millions, seized on this agonizing recollection to repeat the bizarre falsehood that the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six adults at the elementary school in Newtown, Conn., was an elaborate hoax invented by government-backed “gun grabbers.” On his radio show, Mr. Jones said Mr. Heslin needed to clarify “because the coroner said no, the parents weren’t allowed to have touched the kids or have seen the kids.” He played a video in which the InfoWars “reporter” Owen Shroyer says of Mr. Heslin, “He’s claiming that he held his son and saw the bullet hole in his head.” “That is not possible,” Mr. Shroyer said. More than five years after one of the most horrific mass shootings in modern history, the families of Sandy Hook victims are still enduring daily threats and online abuse from people who believe bogus theories spread by Mr. Jones, whom President Trump has praised for his “amazing” reputation. Now, for the first time, the families are confronting Mr. Jones in court. “When anybody’s behind a machine, whether it’s a gun or a computer or a car, a dehumanization takes place that makes it easier to commit an act of violence,” Veronique De La Rosa, the mother of Noah Pozner, another victim, said in an interview. She is suing Mr. Jones, she said, because she wants to force him to admit to his devotees that “he peddled a falsehood, that Sandy Hook is real and that Noah was a real, living, breathing little boy who deserved to live out the rest of his life.” In three separate lawsuits — the most recent was filed on Wednesday in Superior Court in Bridgeport, Conn. — the families of eight Sandy Hook victims as well as an F.B.I. agent who responded to the shooting seek damages for defamation. The families allege in one suit, filed by Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder in Bridgeport, that Mr. Jones and his colleagues “persistently perpetuated a monstrous, unspeakable lie: that the Sandy Hook shooting was staged, and that the families who lost loved ones that day are actors who faked their relatives’ deaths.” "
29,"RICHMOND, Ky. — People have been telling Amy McGrath “no” for a long time. No, you cannot compete against the boys in sports. No, you cannot serve in combat or fly fighter jets. And no, you certainly cannot defeat the popular mayor of the largest city in your congressional district as a first-time candidate. A wall of trophies, a degree from the Naval Academy, 89 combat flight missions and one stunning House Democratic primary victory later, Ms. McGrath is growing more used to the sound of “yes,” even as she moves to turn around the toughest “no’s” yet, Republican voters in the suddenly bellwether Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky. On Tuesday, she easily defeated Jim Gray, the well-liked mayor of Lexington, for the Democratic nomination in Kentucky’s Sixth. Republicans moved immediately to define her as the far-left candidate who triumphed despite a rejection by the Democratic establishment. But Democrats united around her just as quickly, turning the fight this summer and fall for Kentucky’s Sixth into a critical test of the Democrats’ vaunted “blue wave.” The story of how Ms. McGrath became an avatar for that wave is a narrative that combined a compelling biography, risk-taking, the virtues of the digital age and the willingness to compete even when party elders in Washington were trying to stop her. She slogged through a grueling climb in the polls, suffered a personal tragedy just last month, then fended off a late and unexpected negative attack — all for the chance to compete against an incumbent Republican, Representative Andy Barr, who won his last re-election race by 22 percentage points. “I have never heard someone so persistent,” said Mark Putnam, her campaign’s ad maker. "
30,"In response to both the election of Barack Obama in 2008 and the backlash in favor of Donald Trump in 2016, analysts and commentators have focused mostly on racial attitudes on the right. Both scholarship and journalistic accounts of American politics have drilled down on the increased opposition to immigration and high levels of racial resentment among Obama opponents and Trump supporters. But few have investigated the countervailing trend on the left, the increasing racial liberalism of Democratic voters, which I’ve been thinking about for a while. Though Mr. Obama’s presidency ended up being defined in many ways by America’s reaction to his race, he carefully avoided racially liberal appeals during his original campaign, even taking the time to criticize the purported excesses of campus liberalism. Mr. Obama had begun his national political career with a speech at the Democratic convention in 2004, declaring that “there’s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there’s the United States of America.” During his 2008 campaign, to give just one example, he turned down an invitation to Tavis Smiley’s State of the Black Union, an event Hillary Clinton attended. During her 2016 campaign, Mrs. Clinton invoked concepts like intersectionality, white privilege, implicit bias and systemic racism. She warned of “deplorables,” while Mr. Obama once gave a speech arguing that “to wish away the resentments of white Americans, to label them as misguided or even racist, without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns” was something that “widens the racial divide, and blocks the path to understanding.” According to the American National Election Studies 2016 survey, Democrats perceived Mrs. Clinton as more racially liberal than they had perceived Mr. Obama in 2012, when his strategy was not notably different. This shift in political rhetoric has coincided with an underappreciated trend: the rapid increase in the racial liberalism of Democrats, including white Democrats, which I analyzed in a recent report by my think tank, Data for Progress. The General Social Survey asks a question about the causes of racial inequality and allows respondents to select whether they think various factors contribute to inequality. Two possible answers are “discrimination” and “willpower,” which are the two variables I explore here (respondents could select both if they chose). The first roughly measures whether respondents take a structural view of racial inequality and the second whether they take a more individualistic view of racial inequality. "
31,"WASHINGTON — The same symptoms of a mysterious attack that sickened American diplomats in Cuba have been reported at a United States consulate in southern China, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told lawmakers on Wednesday. At least one American government employee in China recently reported what the State Department’s consulate in Guangzhou described as subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure. “The medical indications are very similar and entirely consistent with the medical indications that have taken place to Americans working in Cuba,” Mr. Pompeo told the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He said medical teams were heading to Guangzhou to address what he described as one incident. “We are working to figure out what took place, both in Havana and now in China as well,” Mr. Pompeo said. Twenty-four United States personnel in Havana suffered a slew of health problems that resemble those that result from mild brain trauma such as a concussion, including sharp ear pain, dull headaches, tinnitus, vertigo, disorientation, nausea and extreme fatigue. The Cubans repeatedly denied any responsibility for the problems and decried the plunge in relations with the United States under Mr. Trump. "
32,"ROME — The populist parties that won Italy’s elections two months ago by demonizing the political establishment, the European Union and illegal migrants in often vulgar terms were granted the go-ahead on Wednesday to form a government, crystallizing some of the biggest fears of Europe’s leaders, who were already bracing for turbulence. The rapid ascent of populists in Italy — the birthplace of Fascism, a founding member of the European Union, and the bloc’s fourth-largest economy — shattered the nation’s decades-old party system. It also gave fresh energy to the nationalist impulses tugging at the Continent and moved the greatest threat to the European Union’s cohesion from newer member states on the periphery, such as Hungary and Poland, to its very core. After 80 days of arduous talks, President Sergio Mattarella gave a mandate to form a government to the parties’ consensus pick for prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, a little-known lawyer with no government experience. Critics assert that he will be but a pawn of the populist parties behind him: the Five Star Movement, a web-based protest party untested at a national level; and the League, a hard-right party that campaigned on a stridently Italians-first platform. Mr. Conte promised “a government of change” that would “safeguard the interests of Italians” after emerging from a nearly two-hour meeting with the president at the Quirinal Palace and greeting a throng of reporters.

33,"To the Editor: Re “ ‘This Is Not a Drill’: The Growing Threat of Nuclear Cataclysm,” by Clyde Haberman (Retro Report, May 14): Denuclearization is a term no one has been able to clearly define or agree on, and yet it is at the center of the talks between the Koreas and the United States. The bravado of President Trump has helped renew a threat of nuclear war. There is already side-taking and talk of subterfuge and failure. Faith and an attitude of positivity are essential at a time like this. Negotiation with the idea of consensus, not ego, should guide the talks. Having grown up in the “duck and cover” generation of the 1950s, I clearly remember the fear I felt huddled under my desk. I don’t want my 1-year-old grandchild ever to have to grow up in an era of fear and insecurity. The United States is faced with an opportunity to negotiate a chance to end or at least minimize the threat of nuclear war. The world cannot squander an opportunity that may not come again. War is clearly not the answer. BRUCE CHARLICK, JENKINTOWN, PA. "

35,"WASHINGTON — Federal Reserve officials gave no indication that they are likely to speed up their pace of interest rate increases during their most recent two-day meeting, suggesting instead that they would be willing to allow the inflation rate to rise slightly above 2 percent for a “temporary period,” while the economy continues to expand. Minutes from the meeting, which ended May 2 and are released after a typical three-week delay, reveal Fed officials are on track to raise rates again in June. The minutes also indicate officials are less worried about inflation rising above 2 percent, its current level and the Fed’s target rate, than they are about the rate of inflation dipping again. Officials continue to see the economy as strong, but they remain worried about global trade tensions, including potential damage from American and Chinese tariffs and the possibility that uncertainty over trade policy could already be crimping business investment in the United States. Officials at the Federal Open Market Committee concluded the May 2 meeting with a unanimous decision to leave the Fed’s benchmark interest rate unchanged, at a range from 1.5 to 1.75 percent. The Fed last raised interest rates in March, by a quarter of a percentage point. It is widely expected to raise them by the same amount at its next meeting in June. The minutes from the May meeting reported that officials said recent economic indicators “had increased their confidence that inflation on a 12-month basis would continue to run near the committee’s longer-run 2 percent symmetric objective.” But the minutes noted that some officials believed “it was premature to conclude that inflation would remain at levels around 2 percent, especially after several years in which inflation had persistently run below the committee’s 2 percent objective.” Some officials noted, the minutes added, that “a temporary period of inflation modestly above 2 percent would be consistent with the committee’s symmetric inflation objective and could be helpful in anchoring longer-run inflation expectations at a level consistent with that objective.” "
36,"The references come pouring out of André Leon Talley, discriminating and indiscriminate. About midway through the documentary “The Gospel According to André,” Mr. Talley — a fashion world Zelig for more than four decades — is expounding on a Vogue photo shoot he supervised featuring Cindy Crawford as a grieving widow in a veil. A nod to Jackie Kennedy, of course. But also the films of Luchino Visconti, he says. And Empress Sisi of Austria. Earlier in the film, discussing a designer’s collection, he declares, “Eskimos were treated like the aristocrats, and the aristocrats were treated like the serfs.” Mr. Talley’s kinetic word association is loud, geyserlike and inspiring. And as a figure, he is joyous, absurd, leonine but tender. Yet even with this raw material, “Gospel” doesn’t rise to Mr. Talley’s vitality. The director, Kate Novack, has delivered a film that’s detailed and affectionate, but also frustratingly static, making a point not to get in its subject’s way. The parts of Mr. Talley’s story told through archival footage are fascinating — a staggeringly tall gay black man from the American South inventing himself as a bon vivant (“You can be aristocratic without having been born into an aristocratic family”) and making himself welcome, and essential, at the pinnacle of the Paris and New York fashion world. As high fashion was becoming pop culture, Mr. Talley was there, first as a kind of aide-de-camp to Diana Vreeland, and later as an essential compatriot to Anna Wintour in her early Vogue days. (In the film, Ms. Wintour says he knows more about fashion history than she does.) "
37,"Apart from the man himself, perhaps nothing has defined President Trump’s political persona more than Twitter. But on Wednesday, one of Mr. Trump’s Twitter habits — his practice of blocking critics on the service, preventing them from engaging with his account — was declared unconstitutional by a federal judge in Manhattan. Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald, addressing a novel issue about how the Constitution applies to social media platforms and public officials, found that the president’s Twitter feed is a public forum. As a result, she ruled that when Mr. Trump or an aide blocked seven plaintiffs from viewing and replying to his posts, he violated the First Amendment. If the principle undergirding Wednesday’s ruling in Federal District Court stands, it is likely to have implications far beyond Mr. Trump’s feed and its 52 million followers, said Jameel Jaffer, the Knight First Amendment Institute’s executive director and the counsel for the plaintiffs. Public officials throughout the country, from local politicians to governors and members of Congress, regularly use social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to interact with the public about government business. [Read more: Twitter users talk about getting blocked by the president.] “This ruling should put them on notice, and if they censor critics from social media accounts used for official purposes, they run the risk that someone will sue them and win,” he said of public officials. Asked whether the administration would unblock the users or appeal the ruling, Kerri Kupec, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department’s civil division, demurred from making any specific pronouncement. “We respectfully disagree with the court’s decision and are considering our next steps,” she said. "
38,"“The indigenous American berserk,” Philip Roth’s encapsulation of the country he loved, is a resonating phrase in this time of repetitive school shootings, incontinent presidential tweets, tawdry abuse of public office, rule by mob incitement, manipulation through falsehood, wall obsessions, and the truncation of the English language to a 77-word lexicon “better called Jerkish,” as Roth described Donald’s Trump’s miserable linguistic impact in The New Yorker. Perhaps Roth timed his exit on Tuesday, at the age of 85, as an admonition to a disoriented nation. His “berserk,” alongside his full-throated celebration of the American panoply and riotous exploration of “the great pervasive Anti-You that someone with a grudge might prefer to call God,” often had a menacing side. In “American Pastoral,” perhaps his greatest novel, the American dream of Seymour “Swede” Levov, the assimilated Jew of Viking-evoking athletic ability and appearance during his Newark youth, comes apart in the vortex of his daughter’s descent into terrorism. In “The Plot Against America,” it is the whole country that succumbs in 1940 to a president of Nazi sympathies, the flying ace Charles A. Lindbergh. The novel was published in 2004. After Sept. 11, the United States was no longer synonymous with sanctuary, an enduring change in its sense of self. It, too, could be gripped by the unspeakable. For Roth the imagination was also counter-history. He teased out, with extraordinary energy and wit, the full literary potential of every “What if?” He embarked, imagination irrepressible, down every road not taken at the fork. I found Roth liberating. I am grateful to him above all for the way he introduced me, in wonder, to the exuberance and stubbornness, the unabashed sexual and social complexes, of American Jewishness; and for the rollicking cavalcade of the United States he set before me, an English Jew of South African descent raised not to make a fuss about the odd anti-Semitic remark and to assimilate in England, the land, at least when I grew up in it, of Lewis Namier’s “trembling Israelites.” Roth offered American space, which is also ever-renewed American possibility. He personified another way of living as a Jew. In his novel “Deception,” Roth has his American protagonist say to his British lover, “In England, whenever I’m in a public place, a restaurant, a party, the theater, and someone happens to mention the word ‘Jew,’ I notice that the voice always drops a little.” She challenges him, prompting the American to insist, yes, that’s how “you all say ‘Jew.’ Jews included.” "
39,"When President Trump signed an executive order this year directing federal agencies to review adding work requirements to federal assistance programs, he said such requirements would “increase self-sufficiency, well-being and economic mobility.” Paul Ryan reportedly cast requirements as an attempt at “getting people the skills and opportunity to get into the work force.” Seema Verma, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said they would improve “health and well-being through incentivizing work and community engagement.” Ignore the platitudes. Work requirements have never been about helping the poor or unemployed. They’ve always been about punishing black people. This has become abundantly clear over the last few weeks as states drafting policies requiring Medicaid recipients get a job or engage in other employment activity have added exemptions. These carve-outs would, in effect, spare white, rural residents from work requirements but not black ones in urban areas. These proposals have turned the subtext that was there all along into legible text. Kentucky, Ohio and Virginia are seeking waivers from the Department of Health and Human Services that would allow them to impose work requirements on some Medicaid recipients, but not all of them. They all included exemptions for counties with the highest unemployment levels, which are rural, mostly white areas. Urban centers where lots of black people are unemployed, but whose county-level unemployment rates are lower, would be subject to the work requirement. In Michigan, lawmakers are backing off from a similar exemption after it was criticized for its racial inequality. As the University of Michigan law professors Nicholas Bagley and Eli Savit recently argued, it doesn’t matter whether this was done on purpose. It’s still racial discrimination when it’s so clearly going to have such a disparate impact on black people. Michigan provided clear evidence of how race plays out in the push for work requirements: White people, who are 57 percent of the state’s Medicaid population, would have constituted 85 percent of those exempted. Black people, who make up 23 percent of enrollees, would have made up just 1.2 percent of the exempted. "
40,"BRUSSELS — As Italy’s new populist leaders prepare to form a government, European leaders are bracing for potential new confrontations over migration and some of the core principles of the common currency, the euro. They were already trying to tame a rebellion against Europe’s shared democratic values in the east, led by Hungary and Poland. They now face the prospect that Italy, a founding member and Europe’s fourth-largest economy, could be next to challenge the bloc’s cohesion, finances and democratic principles. If nothing else, anxiety about the economic plans of the new Italian government may finish off the ambitious reform agenda for a more integrated euro area proposed by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. “The new Italian government will give Germany every excuse not to do what Macron would like and it will destabilize the markets,” said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a research institution. “It will increase the risk of another eurozone banking crisis, not reduce it.” Last week Italy’s populist parties, the Five Star Movement and the hard-right League, said they would sharply increase spending and repeal reforms of the labor market and the pension system, violating financial limits imposed by Brussels and meant to apply to any country using the euro. The plans would throw an already weak Italian economy into further debt. And the consequences are certain to ripple through the bloc, where leaders worry about another financial crisis just as Greece finally seems to be exiting from its eight-year bailout program. "
41,"Congress is picking apart the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, just in time for the 10th anniversary of the Great Recession, the type of economic conflagration the law was supposed to prevent. You remember the Great Recession, don’t you? It consumed trillions of our dollars because banks had overinvested in risky securities few people really understood, which were tied to riskier mortgages that they were underwriting. Apparently, Congress thinks that can’t be repeated. They will probably be proven wrong, like others who have thought economic disasters were one-shot deals. Our history is rife with them. The Panic of 1873 was set off by the failure of the investment bank Jay Cooke & Company, which had overinvested in leading edge technology — railroads. The collapse of some 100 banks would soon follow. In 1907, the Knickerbocker Trust keeled over after making bad loans to that era’s version of hedge funders. Serial bank failures ensued, requiring a bailout organized by J. Pierpont Morgan. At least that led to some reform, the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913, to supply liquidity to markets. But when banks invested in the red-hot stock market, the Fed could not stop the Great Depression that followed. "

43,"WASHINGTON — The United States has disinvited China from participating in a multinational naval exercise scheduled for this summer, further escalating tensions with Beijing that have spanned from trade to North Korea to the military. The Pentagon cited China’s rapid military buildup on disputed islands in the South China Sea for withdrawing the invitation for Beijing to participate in the large-scale naval exercise known as Rim of the Pacific, or RimPac. Defense Department officials said on Wednesday that China’s decision to place surface-to-air missile systems and other offensive weaponry on the islands spurred the move. The military snub comes after President Trump suggested the Chinese might be influencing North Korea’s recent talk of withdrawing from a summit meeting set for June 12 to discuss the dismantling of Pyongyang’s nuclear program. Washington and Beijing also are in the middle of a major trade fight that is part of a perennial battle over market access and technology policy. The conflict over China’s military buildup in the disputed islands adds another layer to the overall tensions between the two global economic powers. “We have strong evidence that China has deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile systems, and electronic jammers to contested features in the Spratly Islands region of the South China Sea,” Lt. Cmdr. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement. "
44,"WASHINGTON — Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has been granted his permanent security clearance, a person briefed on the matter said on Wednesday, ending a period of uncertainty that had fueled questions about whether Mr. Kushner was in peril in the special counsel investigation. Mr. Kushner is a senior presidential aide with a prominent role in Middle East diplomacy. But his F.B.I. background checks dragged on for a year and became one of many political distractions for the White House. Even some inside the administration suspected that Mr. Kushner’s delay reflected legal problems on the horizon. The permanent clearances make Mr. Kushner, who is married to Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, eligible to view some of the United States’ most closely guarded secrets, including the daily intelligence briefing that Mr. Trump receives and the delicate intelligence on the Israelis and the Palestinians that former diplomats said can be valuable in negotiations. Top-secret clearances are typically required for people viewing foreign intelligence or sitting in on high-level White House meetings. White House officials were adamant that the lengthy process was not unusual for a government official who has a complicated financial history and many foreign contacts. But with the special counsel investigating some of Mr. Kushner’s meetings with Russian officials, it left open the question of whether investigators had uncovered evidence that made him a security threat. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is investigating whether anyone around Mr. Trump conspired with the Russian government to help influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Kushner’s meetings with the Russian ambassador, a Kremlin-connected lawyer and a prominent Russian banker have all attracted scrutiny. The resolution of his clearances does not guarantee that Mr. Kushner faces no legal jeopardy. But Mark S. Zaid, a veteran Washington lawyer who handles security clearances, said it was highly unlikely that the special counsel would uncover evidence of improper foreign entanglements and not flag it for security officials.

nnovators come in many forms. Take Tom Smith. He’s a pig farmer in rural Victoria, a quiet man with a white beard who you’d walk right by in Bunnings without even noticing. But in 2008, without any guidance, he went out on a limb and posted a help wanted ad in a Manila newspaper. Then he went there, found a few people he liked and started sponsoring worker visas. It was a bold if simple act that has led dozens of Filipino families to move to a town called Pyramid Hill — reversing population decline, and laying the groundwork for a model of multiculturalism far healthier than what can be found in many cities. “When you’re desperate, it’s just what you do,” Tom told me when we first met. But it wasn’t just that. There was a glint of mischief in his eye. “I saw it as a bit of a challenge,” he said, smiling, “to try and do something different.” That urge to break the mold, to resist conformity and decline, ran through the story I wrote about Pyramid Hill’s transformation. "
46,"An anti-establishment leader takes power after a contentious election. His administration quickly proves itself remarkably corrupt; but he subverts the legal system and is able not only to suppress investigations into his corruption — his supporters denounce it all as a “witch hunt” — but also to consolidate his rule and undermine institutions (the “deep state”) that might have limited his power. Am I talking about Donald Trump? I could be. But the figure I actually have in mind is Recep Tayyip Erdogan, president of Turkey, whose success in getting away with obvious corruption by politicizing law offers a disturbing preview of how Trump may become the authoritarian ruler he clearly wants to be. Not surprisingly, Trump, who basically seems to like dictators in general, has expressed admiration for Erdogan and his regime. Authoritarian instincts and contempt for rule of law aren’t the only things Erdogan and Trump have in common. Both also have contempt for expertise. In particular, both have surrounded themselves with people notable both for their ignorance and for their bizarre views. Erdogan has advisers who believe that he is under psychic assault; Trump has advisers who yell profanities at each other while on trade missions. But does it matter? In America, stocks are up and the economy keeps chugging along. Erdogan has presided over an actual economic boom. Investors and markets don’t seem to mind the craziness at the top. The fact that economic policymakers have no idea what they’re talking about doesn’t seem to make any difference. Until it does. The truth is that most of the time the quality of economic leadership matters much less than most people — economic leaders included — believe. Really destructive policies, like those driving Venezuela into the ditch, are one thing. But run-of-the-mill policies like changes in tax law, even if they’re pretty big and clearly irresponsible, rarely have dramatic effects. Last year, for example, Trump and his allies in Congress rammed through a nearly $2 trillion tax cut. That’s a pretty big number, even for an economy as large as ours. But aside from fueling an unprecedented wave of stock buybacks, the tax cut is having little discernible effect, good or bad. There’s no sign of the investment boom advocates promised, but there’s also no sign that investors are losing faith in U.S. solvency. "

48,"WASHINGTON — President Trump likes to keep allies and adversaries guessing, but his decision to begin a trade investigation that could trigger auto tariffs was met by surprise at home and abroad, and prompted warnings that it could destabilize global supply chains. Mr. Trump has argued that tariffs would encourage companies to move production back to American soil after years of offshoring and he has seized on levies as a way to force trading partners to make concessions, such as limiting exports to the United States. But critics of Mr. Trump’s approach say the president is sowing uncertainty that threatens to undercut economic growth and send trading relations to a previously unseen level of disarray. Mr. Trump’s latest tariff threat came Wednesday, in the middle of a series of foreign policy challenges: White House officials canceled a meeting with North Korea, drew the ire of lawmakers by considering easing penalties on a Chinese telecom firm and said they had secured a $200 billion trade concession with China, only to have the deal fall through. But that wasn’t all. This week, India filed formal challenges to Mr. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs at the World Trade Organization, joining the European Union, Japan, Russia and Turkey. Even members of the president’s own party warned of the debilitating uncertainty businesses are facing from his scattershot approach. "
49,"WASHINGTON — The artillery barrage was so intense that the American commandos dived into foxholes for protection, emerging covered in flying dirt and debris to fire back at a column of tanks advancing under the heavy shelling. It was the opening salvo in a nearly four-hour assault in February by around 500 pro-Syrian government forces — including Russian mercenaries — that threatened to inflame already-simmering tensions between Washington and Moscow. In the end, 200 to 300 of the attacking fighters were killed. The others retreated under merciless airstrikes from the United States, returning later to retrieve their battlefield dead. None of the Americans at the small outpost in eastern Syria — about 40 by the end of the firefight — were harmed. The details of the Feb. 7 firefight were gleaned from interviews and documents newly obtained by The New York Times. They provide the Pentagon’s first public on-the-ground accounting of one of the single bloodiest battles the American military has faced in Syria since deploying to fight the Islamic State. The firefight was described by the Pentagon as an act of self-defense against a unit of pro-Syrian government forces. In interviews, United States military officials said they had watched — with dread — hundreds of approaching rival troops, vehicles and artillery pieces in the week leading up to the attack. The prospect of Russian military forces and American troops colliding has long been feared as the Cold War adversaries take opposing sides in Syria’s seven-year civil war. At worst, officials and experts have said, it could plunge both countries into bloody conflict. And at a minimum, squaring off in crowded battlefields has added to heightened tensions between Russia and the United States as they each seek to exert influence in the Middle East. "
50,"“The big black” and “the big negro” are just two of the phrases that The New York Times used to describe Jack Johnson. “Johnson Weds White Girl” was the headline when he married Lucille Cameron in 1912. He has been called a “negro pugilist and convicted white slaver,” who left a stain “on boxing and on his race” and abused “the fame and fortune that came to him.” Yet, condescendingly, he also was described as being “far above the average negro both mentally and physically.” For The Times, Johnson, who in 1908 became the first black boxer to win the world heavyweight title, was inseparable from his race. It permeated how the newspaper covered every detail of his life, from his boxing to his legal troubles to his demeanor and success. The Times’s coverage illuminates the challenges for broad acceptance faced by Johnson, who inspired the 1967 play and 1970 movie “The Great White Hope,” an account of his life and career and the resolve of white society to dethrone him, both in the ring and outside it. Johnson resurfaced in the news last month when President Trump tweeted that he would consider pardoning Johnson, who was convicted on federal charges of transporting a woman across state lines “for immoral purposes.” Johnson, who served a year in prison, had been a lover of that woman, Belle Schreiber, who was white and had worked as a prostitute. President Trump announced the pardon on Thursday. The campaign for it had been complicated in part by allegations that Johnson had a history of domestic violence, as historians have chronicled. It was one reason the Obama administration cited for not granting a pardon. "
51,"To the Editor: Re “Plan to Revive Abortion Limit Set by Reagan” (front page, May 18): The Trump administration plans to impose a domestic gag rule on abortion counseling and provision. Only 18 percent of Americans polled in July 2017 reported that abortion should be illegal in all or most instances. Yet the president is allowing this minority to impose its beliefs on the entire American population. This country was built on the fundamental rights of freedom of speech and freedom of religion, and the domestic gag rule directly opposes those rights. Those who find contraception and abortion objectionable for religious reasons can adhere to those beliefs, but enforcing those beliefs in a secular society amounts to religious discrimination.

52,"If you happened to turn your attention to the sand pit of New York politics this week, you might have found yourself beset by a series of vexing questions. Why, for instance, at the state’s Democratic Convention on Wednesday, where Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo received the support of 95 percent of delegates in his bid for a third term, did he greet Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and presidential candidate, with a bouquet of flowers? Would perfume have been better? If she was getting roses and baby’s breath, what was the governor planning for Joe Biden, set to speak the following day? Gerber daisies and a half-dozen hydrangeas? You might rummage around the oddity of all that for a bit and then wonder what was going on with the Women’s Equality Party, about which you have probably heard very little over the past few years, if you have ever heard anything all. First and foremost, the W.E.P., as it is called, is not to be confused with the W.F.P., which is to say the Working Families Party. Put it this way: If the Working Families Party is Fleetwood Mac, the W.E.P. is Rumours, Binghamton’s premier Fleetwood Mac tribute band. Although the actress and education activist Cynthia Nixon, an actual woman, won the nomination of the W.F.P. to challenge the governor in the Democratic primary this year, she did not receive the endorsement of the W.E.P. This went instead to Mr. Cuomo himself because, really, to whom else would it go? He conceived the party four years ago when he was running for re-election the first time, as a means of appealing to female voters. “Yes, Cynthia is woman, and yes she represents a lot of our values, but we have a governor who literally created the party,” Susan Zimet, the chairwoman of the W.E.P. told me. During the 2014 election, Mr. Cuomo drove around the state in a bus called the Women’s Equality Express, which had a pink stripe adorning its side. Some found the entire enterprise craven and patronizing — and an obvious effort to peel off votes from the W.F.P., which had been fighting for paid sick leave and other causes vital to women’s lives for many years. Others found it duplicitous, given the rampant culture of sexual harassment that had been permitted to fester for so long in the state capital. During that race, Mr. Cuomo was challenged by an unknown law professor, Zephyr Teachout, who wound up, to great surprise, receiving a third of the vote. In the wake of former Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman’s downfall over allegations that he had physically abused four women he had been dating, Ms. Teachout announced this week that she will be running to replace him. But given the history, she is as likely to receive the backing of the W.E.P. as Noam Chomsky is of getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Donald Trump. It seems a lot like a political shell company. "
53,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Cancels Meeting With Kim, Citing ‘Open Hostility’ ” (nytimes.com, May 24): As surely as the Russian downing of an ill-advised U-2 flight doomed the Eisenhower-Khrushchev summit of 1960 that might have averted the arms race, the deliberately insulting remarks by Vice President Mike Pence and the national security adviser, John Bolton, doomed a Trump-Kim summit. By touting the Libyan model (nuclear disarmament, then United States-backed regime change), they stoked fears that they should have been working to assuage. This administration has also snatched war from the jaws of peace by renouncing the nuclear deal with Iran. It is now the urgent responsibility of Congress to bar President Trump from launching an attack on North Korea without specific congressional authorization. Nuclear disarmament will occur not through the caprice of an egocentric president, but through a renewed grass-roots global movement to halt a gratuitous nuclear arms race and to rid the Earth of nuclear weapons before we suffer an actual nuclear catastrophe. DAVID KEPPEL, BLOOMINGTON, IND. To the Editor: What an incredibly childish letter President Trump has sent to Kim Jong-un of North Korea, canceling the summit meeting. Here are the standard Trumpisms of “a wonderful dialogue” and “a beautiful gesture,” offset by a reference that our massive nuclear capability is much bigger than Mr. Kim’s. Whether some White House flunky wrote this, using Mr. Trump’s limited vocabulary, or Mr. Trump himself doesn’t matter. What matters is that South Korea’s efforts to produce a saner modus vivendi with the North, and perhaps even a peace treaty, have been deeply undercut. Once again, it’s all about Mr. Trump’s grandstanding rather than intelligent international negotiations. SHEILA K. JOHNSON, CARDIFF, CALIF. To the Editor: This should surprise no one. Here’s why this outcome was predicted by many: First, process: Real diplomacy isn’t carried out via Twitter. Second, institutional decline: Many highly skilled diplomats within the State Department have left, leaving major gaps. Third, understanding: President Trump has demonstrated little patience to even attempt to grasp many issues. This is a man who doesn’t take the time to read summarized daily intelligence briefings, let alone to master complicated global problems. Fourth, leadership: Mr. Trump has proven himself incapable of mustering enough support even within his own party to win major legislative achievements, in spite of controlling both the House and the Senate. On top of this all, in the coming months, Mr. Trump will be facing a serious test of his legitimacy as president. The world knows this, and it may help explain why he was just trolled by Kim Jong-un.

54,"Yesterday, the National Football League announced it would fine teams whose players refuse to stand for the national anthem on the field. The owners were responding to President Trump’s call last September to fire any “son of a bitch” who “disrespects our flag.” Among those protesting police brutality and racial injustice were 10 players from the New Orleans Saints who sat on the bench during the national anthem. My good friend Kenny Vaccaro was one of them. We had no idea, however, that Kenny’s decision would incite such rage in our donors that it would hinder our project to help kids in Kenya. Kenny and I had become friends while I was training at the University of Texas at Austin. I was a professional rugby player from New Zealand recovering from spine surgery. Kenny, a junior from Brownwood, Tex., was a starting safety on the Texas football team. We bonded quickly. Kenny had lost his father to emphysema at a young age, and my father was battling leukemia that proved fatal. We felt the same passion for our sports, and we talked of one day using our platform as athletes to make a difference in the world. I was with Kenny’s family at Radio City Music Hall when the Saints selected him in the first round of the 2013 NFL Draft. My father became involved in philanthropy toward the end of his life, and I remember his saying that he wished he hadn’t waited so long. Almost three years to the day after his death, I took his advice. Then I retired from rugby at 28. I flew to Kenya to volunteer at Blessed Hope Primary School in the Kibera slums of Nairobi. "
55,"When I married in 2000, I changed my name. I expanded it — kept my name but added my husband’s name, Kaplan, without a hyphen. I wanted my name to reflect a conjoining that was also an evolution, literally one thing following another. This was an experiment, as all marriages are, that felt exciting and open-ended, not least because I’m black and my husband was white. I wasn’t excited because I thought we’d be some kind of symbol of racial resolution. I was hardly that naïve, and neither was Alan. I am a journalist who had been covering black matters for years at that point, and Alan was a locally famous high school teacher of American history who believed that race and racism had shaped America far more than it was willing to admit. Not surprisingly, he didn’t think changing my name was a great idea. “Black people know you as Erin Aubry,” he said bluntly. “They’ll resent a name so obviously white and Jewish. It’ll get in your way.” He wasn’t being snide or heroic. One of the many things he’d figured out is that white people showing up in a black space, including the intimate space of a relationship, is seen by many black folks as an incursion, even if they don’t say so. That he understood and was even sympathetic to this view impressed me, but I changed my name anyway. It felt romantic. We were married nearly 15 years. In the summer of 2015, Alan died unexpectedly from complications following a routine surgery. He was only 60. A little more than a year after that, Donald Trump was elected president. Since then I have wrestled with two kinds of grief: losing Alan and losing the singular honesty and clarity he brought to the issue of race not just as my husband but as a white man in America. The griefs are related, one compounding the other. In this new age of racial retrenchment, without the incisiveness Alan brought to our discussions of whiteness and its vastly underestimated impact on the national psyche, I feel more alone than at any other time in my life. Throughout our relationship, we shared a political lens and a common language around the import and meaning of race that was a big part of our intimacy, and part of my certainty that however estranged I might feel from the larger white world, I always had someone at home to talk to. And talk freely: I never had to explain or defend my racial frustrations, anxiety or even paranoia. That isn’t to say Alan agreed with me all the time. We routinely questioned each other’s orthodoxies about white and black. Sparks flew because the stakes were high on both sides, personally and professionally. "
56,"To the Editor: Re “All Must Rise for Anthem, N.F.L. Insists” (front page, May 24): If commercial football continues to insist that it knows the only way to respect flag, anthem and country, I would see nothing wrong with taking a knee myself in the stands when they play the anthem or fly warplanes over the field. It would cost me nothing — nothing close to the financial risks of some conscientious athletes. I love my country and its songs and flag. I am a Navy veteran whose brother died flying in World War II. So I am secure in my own patriotism, unwilling to be instructed about it by a draft-dodging president or his kowtowing sports flag-wavers. JOHN P. MACKENZIE
LONG ISLAND CITY, QUEENS To the Editor: While I do not disagree that employers have a right to set rules about how their employees represent them on the job, I do take issue with employers misrepresenting and besmirching the employees. The Times quotes Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, as stating that the players’ protests created “a false perception among many that thousands of N.F.L. players were unpatriotic.” The players’ actions did not create this perception. Many on the right, including Donald Trump and Mike Pence, did that. I think it’s time we took a step back and looked at the phenomenon of a group of rich white men who refer to themselves as “owners” telling their mostly black employees to “show some respect.” The players were always clear that this was not about patriotism but about inequality and police brutality. When white owners are telling black men to show some respect by telling them when they can kneel and when they can stand, they have really clarified that this has nothing to do with patriotism and everything to do with racism and control. ELAINE EDELMAN
EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. To the Editor: Re “The N.F.L. Kneels to Trump” (editorial, May 24): I agree that the N.F.L.’s ham-handed policy to fine teams whose players kneel during the national anthem is silly. However, the fundamental issue is freedom — not “the right of athletes to protest peacefully” but, rather, the freedom of the N.F.L., as a private entity, to decide upon the image it wishes to present to the public.

57,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. President Trump calls off the North Korea meeting, Burkina Faso cuts ties with Taiwan, and Saudis crack down on female activists. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump has canceled the June 12 summit meeting with Kim Jong-un. He wrote a letter to Mr. Kim citing “tremendous anger and open hostility” from the North Koreans. He was referring to Pyongyang’s reaction to comments by Vice President Mike Pence that North Korea could end up like Libya, a model that has always loomed large for North Korea and prompted two threats of withdrawal from talks. A top North Korean official called Mr. Pence’s remarks “ignorant and stupid.” Mr. Trump’s decision came hours after North Korea destroyed its only known nuclear test site, inviting a select group of journalists — but no outside nuclear monitors — to bear witness. One leader may be pleased by Mr. Trump’s cancellation of the meeting: President Xi Jinping of China, who can use his influence with North Korea as leverage while negotiating a trade deal with Washington. _____ "
58,"Updated on June 1, 2018 They’re back on. President Trump on Friday announced that the summit meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, would be held after all on June 12 in Singapore. The highly anticipated rendezvous was canceled last week, when Mr. Trump sent an emotional letter to Mr. Kim lamenting the missed opportunities. [Read the text of full letter.] But Mr. Trump, who at times sounded like a jilted partner, also held out the possibility for future talks. “If you change your mind having to do with this most important summit,” he wrote, “please do not hesitate to call me or write.” Which Mr. Kim did. On Friday, a high ranking North Korean emissary delivered a personal note to Mr. Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office. That meeting led the announcement of the makeup. Here are the developments in a rocky relationship that got us to this point: “North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States,” Mr. Trump told reporters at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. “They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.” "
59,"WASHINGTON — When Jared Kushner hosted a high-profile summit meeting on federal prison reform at the White House last Friday, some in attendance noticed that the man who was ostensibly in charge of the federal prison system, Mark S. Inch, a retired Army major general, was nowhere in sight. Only Mr. Kushner and a few others knew that Mr. Inch, a genial former military police commander appointed to oversee the Federal Bureau of Prisons and its more than 180,000 inmates just nine months ago, had two days earlier submitted his resignation as the bureau’s director to Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein. By the time President Trump entered the East Room, Mr. Inch had already been ordered to vacate his office and had begun packing up books and memorabilia from his 35-year military career. Mr. Inch told Mr. Rosenstein he was tired of the administration flouting “departmental norms.” And he complained that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had largely excluded him from major staffing, budget and policy decisions, according to three people with knowledge of the situation. Mr. Inch also felt marginalized by Mr. Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, in drafting prison reform legislation, the officials said. He found himself caught in an ideological turf war between Mr. Kushner and Mr. Sessions. Mr. Kushner has championed reforms to the corrections system and more lenient federal sentencing, and Mr. Sessions, a law-and-order conservative and former Alabama attorney general, has opposed significant parts of the bipartisan prison reform bill that Mr. Kushner backs, according to officials. Mr. Kushner, with the president’s support, has been pushing prison reform legislation meant to reduce recidivism by incentivizing inmates — with the possibility of early release to halfway houses or home confinement — to take part in job training and other rehabilitation programs. "
60,"WASHINGTON — President Trump attempted a revolutionary approach to North Korea — a gamble that negotiating prowess and deal-making charm in a face-to-face meeting with Kim Jong-un could accomplish what no American president or diplomat had dared to attempt in the 65 years since an uneasy armistice settled over the Korean Peninsula. It was a bold and innovative approach, and one worth trying, to take on the related goals of a peace treaty and eradicating the North’s now-substantial nuclear arsenal. The fact that it fell on Thursday before getting out of the starting gate, though, underscored how little the two men understood about each other, or how their words and maximalist demands were resonating in Washington and Pyongyang. Mr. Trump approached Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader, as if he were a competing property developer haggling over a prized asset — and assumed that, in the end, Mr. Kim would be willing to give it all up for the promise of future prosperity. So he started with threats of “fire and fury,” then turned to surprise initiatives, then gratuitous flattery of one of the world’s more brutal dictators. “He will be safe, he will be happy, his country will be rich,” Mr. Trump said of the North Korean leader on Tuesday, as he met again with Moon Jae-in, the over-optimistic South Korean president whose national security adviser predicted, that same day, it was “99.9 percent” sure that the summit meeting in Singapore would go ahead. But it was already becoming clear to Mr. Trump and his team that the techniques involved in negotiating real estate do not translate easily into negotiations over nuclear weapons. "

62,"“The Fourth Estate,” which chronicles 16 months in the life of The New York Times, is reasonably competent, but it’s also superficial and oblivious a little more often than one might like. That said, as is the case with the Gray Lady, it’s a good thing that “The Fourth Estate” exists at all. When both the film and the publication are on their A-game, they’re quite good — and occasionally gripping. The documentary, which debuts Sunday on Showtime, also has a lot in common with bloated Netflix dramas, padded and too easily distracted, especially in the first two of its four installments. (The premiere runs 87 minutes, and other segments are about an hour.) It has an irritating habit of darting toward an interesting story and then pivoting away again too quickly. Much of the documentary, which opens on the day Donald J. Trump was inaugurated into office, plods along like a dutiful recap of a show we watched not too long ago. The director Liz Garbus — a veteran documentary filmmaker who received an Oscar nomination for her 2015 film “What Happened, Miss Simone?” — diligently shows what it’s like to work inside a pressure-filled workplace that has no “off” switch. In doing so, she humanizes names like Maggie Haberman and Michael Schmidt, familiar from Twitter and blockbuster stories. It’s odd, though, that so little conflict is on display; it comes as a jarring shock when a reporter talks about how he and some valued colleagues are “at each other’s throats” now and then. It’s hard to delve all that deeply into an institution filled with people who appear to be hyperaware of the scrutiny directed at their workplace, wary of the idea of becoming the story themselves. Add in another distancing factor — a defensive mind-set that often frames critiques of the publication as exercises undertaken in bad faith — and “The Fourth Estate” at times comes off as a portrait of different kinds of awkwardness. The final episode, however, fulfills what was most likely part of the mission statement, as least as far as Times leadership was concerned: to be more accountable and even transparent to The Times’s partisans and critics. In an era in which sexual harassment and other abuses of power have become high-profile stories — in large part due to reporting by The Times — “it was not surprising that, you know, The Times would be in somebody’s sights,” the Washington bureau chief, Elisabeth Bumiller, says in an interview. She’s referring to a November account in Vox of misconduct by the former White House reporter Glenn Thrush, who was suspended for two months after a Times investigation and then reassigned. "
63,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday dismissed as “bizarre” and “outrageous” a Democratic senator’s question about whether President Trump’s business interests could be affecting his administration’s foreign policy. In an exchange before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Pompeo grew testy when Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, asked how Mr. Trump’s finances might impact his foreign policy decisions. It was the second time in two days that the nation’s new chief diplomat displayed a flash of anger during congressional testimony. “Given that the president refuses to disclose his tax returns, how can you assure the American people that American foreign policy is free of his personal conflicts of interest?” Mr. Udall asked. Mr. Pompeo first dismissed the question as “bizarre” and then grew heated. “I have been incredibly involved in this administration’s foreign policy now for some 16 months, and I have seen literally no evidence of what you are scurrilously, scurrilously suggesting,” Mr. Pompeo said, and then added: “It is an outrageous suggestion.” At a hearing on Wednesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Pompeo also got into a testy exchange with a top Democrat. That time, he was defending his blistering criticism of Hillary Clinton in 2015 when he was a conservative congressman from Kansas. "

65,"LONDON — The notices are flooding people’s inboxes en masse, from large technology companies, including Facebook and Uber, and even from parent teacher associations, children’s soccer clubs and yoga instructors. “Here is an update to our privacy policy,” they say. All are acting because the European Union on Friday enacts the world’s toughest rules to protect people’s online data. And with the internet’s borderless nature, the regulations are set to have an outsize impact far beyond Europe. In Silicon Valley, Google, Facebook and other tech companies have been working for months to comply with the new rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation. The law, which lets people request their online data and restricts how businesses obtain and handle the information, has set off a panic among small businesses and local organizations that have an internet presence. Brazil, Japan and South Korea are set to follow Europe’s lead, with some having already passed similar data protection laws. European officials are encouraging copycats by tying data protection to some trade deals and arguing that a unified global approach is the only way to crimp Silicon Valley’s power. “We want to achieve the same level of restrictions that you have in Europe,” said Luiz Fernando Martins Castro, a lawyer based in São Paulo who advises the Brazilian government on internet policy. Mr. Castro said Europe was “pushing the matter and making people realize that we have to go forward.” Europe is determined to cement its role as the world’s foremost tech watchdog — and the region is only getting started. Authorities in Brussels and in the European Union’s 28 member countries are also setting the bar for stricter enforcement of antitrust laws against tech behemoths and are paving the way for tougher tax policies on the companies. "
66,"President Trump pulled out of a highly anticipated meeting with Kim Jong-un. In a letter to the North Korean leader, Trump wrote, “I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting.” "
67,"The Trump administration plans to crack down on international students and visitors who overstay their visas, stoking fears in the higher education community that President Trump’s aggressive immigration policies will hinder university efforts to attract the brightest minds from overseas. In a policy memorandum, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announced this month that it plans to change how it calculates “unlawful presence” for foreigners in the student visa and exchange program. It will also impose harsher punishments — up to a 10-year ban from the country — for graduates who overstay their visas. The policy, due to take effect in August, has been criticized by higher education institutions and student advocates who say the change shows the indiscriminate nature of the Trump administration’s “America First” policies. They say Mr. Trump’s aggressive immigration efforts are shutting out the nation’s leading scholars, who contribute billions of dollars to the economy in the United States, staff its leading research institutions, support its most high-skilled jobs, and contribute to the president’s own goal of strengthening the pipeline to science, technology, mathematics and engineering jobs. “It is clear that in an attempt to ‘enhance public safety,’ the administration seeks to further close the door on academic talent,” said Jill Welch, the deputy executive director for public policy at Nafsa, the Association of International Educators. “This is yet another policy which makes the United States less attractive to talented international students and scholars.” So far, the president has focused his policy efforts on the nation’s borders, and his harshest rhetoric has targeted gang members. But Mr. Trump issued an executive order in January 2017 signaling that visa overstays would also be a target. “Many aliens who illegally enter the United States and those who overstay or otherwise violate the terms of their visas present a significant threat to national security and public safety,” the order said. "
68,"Thursday morning’s letter from President Trump to Kim Jong-un, apparently ending their nuclear negotiation bromance, should come as no surprise. But by once again catching American allies off guard and publicly antagonizing North Korea, the administration has further undermined its own leverage. Over the past year, the president has repeatedly underestimated the importance of making real trade-offs in diplomacy. These choices appear to be anathema to his “go big or go home” style of deal-making. The Trump administration has been eager to jettison the “weak,” “terrible” deals negotiated by previous presidents — including the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Paris climate agreement, and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran. With North Korea, he was seeking something bigger and better, “a very special moment for World Peace.” Instead, the United States may now walk away with nothing. While it’s true that deals like the Iran nuclear agreement had inherent shortcomings, they also effectively advanced America’s national security. In fact, their limitations reflect a hard-nosed assessment of the risk of the alternatives, the broader geostrategic interests in play and the constraints on America’s leverage. In diplomacy, every deal is an imperfect deal. The question is, how imperfect? And at what cost? Unless you can produce a better alternative, tossing out a less-than-perfect agreement that does advance some concrete goals is an exercise in peril. “Repeal” is almost always simpler than “replace.” There may still be time to avoid the all-or-nothing trap with North Korea. While it will not be easy to overcome the fallout of provoking a thin-skinned dictator, the United States might now have a chance to focus on a more credible strategy: a deal that constrains, even if it does not immediately eliminate, North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs without offering unacceptable concessions in return. Whether such a deal is possible depends on Mr. Trump’s ability to embrace the art of the imperfect deal. Developing a stronger negotiating strategy requires acknowledging the obvious: The United States has less leverage than it thinks in this negotiation. Over the last few months, the Trump administration has repeatedly insisted that near-term denuclearization is achievable. This assessment flies in the face of North Korea’s pointed recent statements and long history to the contrary, and it contradicts a new Pentagon report that suggests Mr. Kim views nuclear weapons as essential. No amount of wishful thinking, or even the possibility of reduced American sanctions, will change this reality. The Trump administration will also need to address the divisions among its partners in the region, where Mr. Trump’s inconsistency has weakened his hand in negotiations and allowed our Asian partners to more skillfully maneuver toward their own goals. "
69,"The Trump administration, over the objections of lawmakers, is continuing to try to soften its punishment of ZTE, the Chinese telecommunications firm that has emerged as a key sticking point in trade negotiations between China and the United States. The company is on the verge of shutting down after the United States banned it from buying American components and has become a bargaining chip between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, as the two leaders work to resolve a brewing trade war. Mr. Xi asked Mr. Trump to revisit the ZTE decision because thousands of Chinese jobs could be lost if the company is shuttered. On Thursday, Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, said the administration was considering placing an American compliance team inside ZTE to ensure that the company was meeting its requirements and not violating sanctions. The company was punished for violating United States sanctions against Iran and North Korea and then lying about it. “We’re developing a matrix of things and while we haven’t come quite to a final decision yet, we think there may very well be an alternative that will be quite punitive to them, but really modify behavior,” Mr. Ross said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday. It is not clear if China would allow the United States to exert such a high level of control over a company that is controlled by the Chinese state, but Mr. Ross insisted that the Trump administration had substantial leverage in the matter. ZTE buys many of its components from American companies, including the San Diego-based chip maker Qualcomm. In return for lifting the ban on purchasing American components, the administration could be considering a substantial fine, changes to ZTE’s management and other limits on its ability to operate in the United States. "
70,"President Trump’s abrupt decision to cancel the planned summit meeting with Kim Jong-un is not surprising, given the decades of volatile relations between the United States and North Korea. It’s also not necessarily bad news — if it means that the Trump administration will now take the time to do the preparation needed to make such a high-stakes meeting successful. But it will prove deeply regrettable, and ultimately dangerous, if it winds up meaning that the two hotheaded leaders sulk off and resume the schoolyard taunts that they exchanged over the past 16 months. That would only make conflagration more likely. In yet another sign of Mr. Trump’s carelessness even with his allies, he failed to consult with South Korea, which had helped broker the meeting, before calling it off. “We are trying to figure out what President Trump’s intention is and the exact meaning of it,” a South Korean spokesman said. Even under American administrations that brought more time, expertise and discipline to the task, negotiations and engagement with North Korea have proceeded in fits and starts, ultimately ending in failure and greater mistrust. We hope the president can now find a way to continue the dialogue with Pyongyang and reschedule the meeting, as he suggested he was willing to do in his breakup letter to Mr. Kim on Thursday. Late Thursday, a North Korean vice foreign minister, Kim Kye-gwan, said his government is set “to resolving problems at any time in any way.” Mr. Trump made the right call when he abandoned Republican orthodoxy by pursuing diplomacy with North Korea and, in an impulsive stroke, agreeing to meet Mr. Kim on June 12 in Singapore. It would have been the first face-to-face encounter between American and North Korean leaders since the Korean War ended in an armistice in 1953. Since engaging with North Korea, Mr. Trump has scored some diplomatic gains. After halting nuclear and missile tests and releasing three American detainees, the North Koreans on Thursday apparently blew up their only known nuclear test site. Of course, having made those concessions, Mr. Kim may now feel he needs to do something to demonstrate that he is not truckling to the Americans. "
71,"SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook and Twitter announced plans on Thursday to increase transparency of political campaign ads, changes aimed at preventing foreign manipulation of the coming midterm elections. Facebook said it would begin including a “paid for” label on the top of any political ads in the United States. Clicking on the label will take people to a page where they can view the cost of the ad and the demographic breakdown of the audience that viewed the ad. Facebook also promised to keep an archive of all political ads for the next seven years, or through a full congressional election cycle. The ads are available to Facebook members at facebook.com/politicalcontentads. Twitter said it planned to restrict who could run political ads on its service, requiring those running political ads for federal elections to identity themselves and certify that they are in the United States. Foreign nationals will not be able to target political ads to people in the United States, Twitter said. In addition, Twitter said it would start giving prominent visual cues, including a badge and a disclaimer, to campaign ads. Accounts used for political campaigning must have a profile photo , and any advertiser’s Twitter biography must include a website link that provides valid contact information. Candidates and political committees will be required to provide their identification number from the Federal Election Commission. Those who are not registered must submit a notarized form. Enforcement of the policy will begin this summer. "

73,"President Trump made a version of this claim on Wednesday morning, misquoting James R. Clapper Jr., who was the director of national intelligence under President Barack Obama. It was not true at the time and it remains inaccurate. Mr. Clapper was asked on “The View” on Tuesday whether the F.B.I. was spying on Mr. Trump’s campaign during the 2016 election. “No, they were not. They were spying on, a term I don’t particularly like, but on what the Russians were doing. Trying to understand were the Russians infiltrating, trying to gain access, trying to gain leverage or influence, which is what they do,” he responded. As The New York Times wrote on Wednesday: Mr. Clapper made several other television appearances following Mr. Trump’s claim on Wednesday. Throughout, he maintained that F.B.I. agents did not infiltrate Mr. Trump’s campaign for political purposes. He also repeatedly called the use of an informant “benign.” Here’s what Mr. Clapper said in a CNN interview on Wednesday afternoon: And on PBS NewsHour on Wednesday night:   "
74,"Donald Trump is squandering the best chance the United States has had in years to remake the bilateral trade relationship with China. It’s a remarkable turn of events. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump promised that, if elected, he would bring wholesale change to what he called a “totally unfair” trading relationship. That hasn’t happened. Instead, a Chinese trade delegation left Washington on May 19 without agreeing to any of the structural market reforms, such as an end to subsidies for advanced technology companies, that Trump administration officials were seeking. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin walked back threatened tariffs, and the president himself inexplicably introduced the idea of resuscitating ZTE, the Chinese telecom giant that faced a crippling United States export ban after violating American embargoes against Iran and North Korea. With the tariffs removed, what did the Chinese side offer? The purchase of more American agriculture and energy products, which they would have done anyway, and lower tariffs on auto imports, a concession they had already agreed to weeks ago. By May 20, the Chinese state media had announced that the trade war was off, and Secretary Mnuchin confirmed it on a Sunday morning talk show. The president then retired to Twitter to defend these results as a great win for American agriculture exports, as if that was the point all along. If a trade war has been averted, what kind of peace is this? Chinese officials didn’t concede to anything of substance. Mr. Trump has often said China is “laughing at us.” After this round of negotiations, China must be laughing directly at him. "
75,"The California primary is June 5. It’s one of the most anticipated voting days in the lead-up to the 2018 midterm elections. LOS ANGELES — It was supposed to be a cutting-edge election reform, a way to take the party out of politics: an open primary in which labels like Republican and Democratic were tossed out and candidates were chosen, presumably, on their merits. The system, adopted by California voters in 2010, was meant to make politics less polarizing. But eight years later, the highest-stakes midterm election in a long time is causing all sorts of angst for Democrats and Republicans in California. And that’s in no small part because of what is known as the jungle primary. O.K., before we get to how it’s working, can you explain the system? In the old days, each party nominated a candidate — at a party convention or in a primary — with the idea that a Republican and a Democrat would face off in the November election. In theory, that would present voters with a choice of two governing philosophies. But critics — including Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was the Republican governor at the time — argued that the system was producing ideologically extreme candidates who were forced to appeal to the most fervent wings of their party, and that was leading to gridlock instead of governance. The solution? An open, nonpartisan primary in June, with the first- and second-place candidates heading to the November election, no matter which party they represented. The theory was that candidates would be forced to moderate their appeals to win a broader section of the electorate. That sounds reasonable enough. So what’s the problem? Election reforms that might sound good in a political science class produce, as often as not, unintended consequences. And at the time, party leaders from both sides in California warned that one such consequence of the top-two system could be that major parties would get shut out in the primary, leading to a November ballot between two candidates from the same party. That would happen if multiple candidates from the same party crowded the ballot, canceling each other out as they divided a finite group of voters. And what kind of choice would that be? "
76,"HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. — The giant banner hanging above Cynthia Nixon’s head was as clear as it was ominous: “Welcome to the lions’ den.” Technically, the sign was for the mascots of Hofstra University, where New York Democrats were gathered for their state convention. But it was a more than fitting welcome for Ms. Nixon into a convention hall in the tight grasp of her rival, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. With the sign looming above, Ms. Nixon addressed the party’s progressive caucus on Wednesday without the aid of a microphone, straining to be heard. Nearby, the party’s executive leadership was meeting in a space fully equipped for audio amplification. “This is his turf,” Ms. Nixon said knowingly. The two-day Democratic convention, which concluded on Thursday with Mr. Cuomo’s formal acceptance of his party’s backing, punctuates the challenge facing Ms. Nixon’s insurgent candidacy; to win, she must expand her appeal beyond the faction of die-hard activists who despise Mr. Cuomo, to the broader Democratic electorate. In a 45-minute speech on Thursday before delegates cheering “four more years,” Mr. Cuomo cast New York as the bulwark of Democratic politics against a Republican-controlled Washington. “New York is the alternative state to Trump’s America,” Mr. Cuomo said moments before a celebratory balloon drop.

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. President Trump on Wednesday continued his barrage of attacks on the F.B.I. and the special counsel, Robert Mueller. Trump has been suggesting over the past few days that the F.B.I. embedded a “spy” within his 2016 presidential campaign, but he has provided no evidence of this. On Wednesday, he began using the term “spygate” to describe those accusations. Stephen Colbert said that Trump should pick a more original phrase, pointing out that spygate has been used before. Trump sent out a tweet suggesting spygate represented a comeuppance for the F.B.I. — a suggestion Colbert called hard to justify. Jimmy Kimmel made fun of Trump for a different, pithier tweet he sent on Wednesday. In an interview this week, the CBS journalist Lesley Stahl claimed President Trump once told her that he deliberately attacks journalists in order to “discredit” them in the public eye. Kimmel said the statement sounded atypical of Trump, in one big way. See if you can figure out whether these people are still living with their parents. David Blaine remains astonishing. Anne Hathaway, a star in the new movie “Ocean’s Eight,” will talk with Colbert on Thursday. A conversation with the cast of “Arrested Development” got very raw very quickly. "
78,"BEIJING — President Trump’s decision on Thursday to cancel his planned summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader, will disappoint some allies in Asia, hearten others — and perhaps put China in the strongest position of all. Mr. Trump’s announcement put the brakes on disarmament negotiations that had been hurtling ahead at an unprecedented pace. Instead of a meeting with Mr. Kim, Mr. Trump vowed that “our very strong sanctions, by far the strongest in history, and maximum pressure campaign will continue.” But applying that pressure depends in large part on cooperation from China, which may now be able to use any delays in negotiations with North Korea to its advantage in trade talks with the United States. Much will depend, of course, on how North Korea reacts to Mr. Trump’s decision to pull out of the talks. After a year of breakthrough missile launches and a sixth nuclear test, Mr. Kim abruptly put his nation on a path toward peace — suspending weapons tests, releasing American prisoners and, just hours before Mr. Trump’s announcement, destroying its nuclear test site. It is unclear how Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the meeting with Mr. Kim will affect the internal politics of North Korea’s secretive regime. If Mr. Kim feels compelled to resume weapons tests and his drive to demonstrate that he can strike the United States with a nuclear warhead, the region will be on edge once again. But if he refrains, Mr. Kim may have already earned enough good will among his neighbors — especially China, his country’s main trading partner — to see some softening of the economic sanctions against his isolated nation, without agreeing to give up his nuclear arsenal. "
79,"If it seems as if the noose is tightening around women’s access to abortion, that’s because it is. Iowa just enacted a flagrantly unconstitutional law to ban abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected — at about six weeks of pregnancy, before many women even know they’re pregnant. Mississippi recently banned abortion at 15 weeks, a point well before fetal viability and thus also clearly unconstitutional. A similar bill in Louisiana cleared the legislature and is on the governor’s desk. And of course there’s the Trump administration’s plan to forbid medical professionals in clinics that receive federal money from providing their patients with pertinent and truthful information about abortion. This proposal, aimed at Planned Parenthood, is a clear suppression of free speech that flies in the face of the robust First Amendment that has evolved since the Supreme Court, by a 5 to 4 vote, upheld an earlier abortion gag rule 27 years ago. Some or all of these measures will reach the Supreme Court in due course. Indeed, part of the anti-abortion strategy is to serve up a diet of far-fetched cases: While there is no chance the Supreme Court will uphold the fetal heartbeat law, a defeat serves the greater purpose of keeping the base attentive to the court and motivated at the polls. There is a case already at the court that presents the justices with a more immediate test. It is scheduled for consideration at Thursday’s private conference, where the justices decide which new cases to accept. At issue is whether the court will choose to respond to a bold act of judicial defiance: the refusal by a federal appeals court to apply the Supreme Court’s most recent abortion precedent to a situation that is all but indistinguishable. The new case is an appeal by Planned Parenthood of Arkansas and Eastern Oklahoma from a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The Eighth Circuit refused to block an Arkansas law that requires doctors who provide medication abortions — the two-pill regimen that is used during the first nine weeks of pregnancy — to have a contract with an obstetrician/gynecologist who has hospital admitting privileges. Two years ago, in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, the Supreme Court overturned a Texas law that required doctors who provided abortions either by surgery or medication to have admitting privileges in a local hospital. The court concluded that there was no demonstrable need for the requirement and that any health-related benefit would be outweighed by the drastic limitation the law would have imposed on access to abortion in Texas. The law, which also imposed new physical requirements on abortion clinics, would have led two-thirds of the state’s clinics to close, leaving large areas of Texas without an abortion provider. "
80,"There has been no shortage of analysis of Donald Trump’s rhetorical tics, the way he overuses particular phrases, the way he falls back on others. The way he lies. The way he threatens, bullies and whines with language. All of these observations are at different points hilarious or infuriating, abundantly silly or deadly serious. But there is a strand of these that I find significant: the way Trump’s use of indeterminate language is a way of weakening the fundamental supports of truth itself. Truth is absolute. Things happened or they didn’t, at a particular time. They can be counted and accounted for. But not the way Trump constructs language. It is not just his outright lies that degrade our discourse; it is also his use of language that muddles to the point of meaninglessness, language that rejects exactitude, language that elevates imprecision as a device to avoid being discovered in his deceit. He uses this language to give a false impression that he knows that which he clearly doesn’t, to blame or to bolster, to pretend that he has developed a plan of action rather than admit that he is acting extemporaneously. It all fits into the illusion of competence Trump has built for himself, a fake it-is-how-you-make-it philosophy of advancement in which being studious is for stooges, a world in which passionate vocalization, even of gibberish, is far more valuable than knowledgeable elucidation of fact. "
81,"There has always been a relatively innocent and eminently plausible interpretation for why Donald Trump’s presidential campaign had so many suspicious ties to Russia. Let’s review: First, the candidate himself took an indulgent view of Vladimir Putin. This was naïve, but it was no crime: Barack Obama also sought rapprochement with Moscow in 2008, despite Russia’s invasion of Georgia that year and the Kremlin’s notorious human-rights abuses. Second, Trump had extensive business ties to Russians, both as customers and partners. This, too, isn’t criminal, even if some of those customers and partners were. Third, Trump ran a chaos campaign. It lacked the kind of vetting procedures that might have excluded political grifters like Paul Manafort or Carter Page. Trump hired Manafort in part because he owned an apartment in Trump Tower and promised to work for free. Page came aboard on the casual recommendation of Ed Cox, chairman of the New York Republican Party. Fourth, Trump talks (or tweets) a lot of trash. When, at a rally in October 2016, he said “I love WikiLeaks!” because of its publication of Clinton campaign manager John Podesta’s hacked emails, did the candidate even understand that the U.S. government saw WikiLeaks as a vehicle for Russian political interference? Perhaps not. Finally, Trump was ill-served by his inept son, Don Jr., whose bungled efforts to solicit damaging information on Hillary Clinton from a Russian lawyer would have constituted collusion, if anything had come of it. But Trump himself claims to have been unaware of the infamous Trump Tower meeting at the time. "
82,"President Trump has an almost Apollonian daytime argument in favor of his continued political dominance, which is “Jobs Jobs Jobs!,” “MAGA!” and so forth. He also has a nighttime argument about decline, racial resentment and ethnic hatred. He pushes both strains hard, but the evidence suggests that his heart is really in the hate. Through gut (or gutter) instinct, Trump has adopted a political strategy designed to exploit anger at and resentment toward immigrants as well as racial and ethnic minorities. This is the linchpin of his approach to the 2020 election. Trump’s demonization of nonwhites was and remains essential to his takeover of the Republican Party. His unabashed embrace of insults, epithets and name-calling is well established. In January, my colleagues David Leonhardt and Ian Prasad Philbrick argued in The Times that I asked Stephen Utych, a political scientist at Boise State and the author of a 2017 paper, “How Dehumanization Influences Attitudes toward Immigrants,” whether he saw Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric as part of a larger political war plan. He wrote back by email: This tactic, Utych added, “denies out-groups traits that are uniquely human — things such as the ability to reason, think critically, or feel emotions.” In fact, well before the 2016 election, the white American electorate was becoming increasingly receptive to derogatory language as adherence to standards of the liberal democratic tradition had already begun to waver. Steven Miller and Nicholas Davis, political scientists at Clemson University and Texas A&M, report on poll data collected by the World Values Survey between 1995 and 2011 in their recent paper, “White Outgroup Intolerance and Declining Support for American Democracy”: Intolerance, they continue, Because the Miller-Davis study is based on survey data collected well before the 2016 election, the two authors write, “our analysis might undersell the strength of the relationship between intolerance and anti-democratic attitudes.” Their research suggests that anti-democratic attitudes are on the rise. The percentage of whites who qualified as socially intolerant doubled from 12.6 percent in 1995 to 24.9 percent in 2011, when the most recent World Values Survey was conducted. If that rate of increase were to continue, the percentage of whites in 2020 who would qualify as intolerant would be almost a third. "
83,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump has canceled the June 12 summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, citing in a letter to Mr. Kim this morning “tremendous anger and open hostility” from the North Koreans. Read the full letter here. Earlier today, a top official from the North had said that remarks by Vice President Mike Pence were “ignorant and stupid” and could lead Pyongyang to reconsider the talks. • Mr. Trump’s decision came the same day North Korea destroyed its only known nuclear test site, inviting a select group of journalists — but no outside nuclear monitors — to bear witness. It is unclear if the mountainous Punggye-ri test site, where North Korea has conducted all six of its nuclear tests, was dismantled in a way that would allow it to be used again. • “If I were Jared Kushner, I’d be sighing a breath of relief today.” That was a veteran Washington lawyer summing up the news that President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser had been granted his security clearance after an extended F.B.I. background check. Mr. Kushner had spent the first year of the administration working under provisional clearances. White House officials had said the long process was not unusual, but some observers had wondered if Mr. Kushner faced problems because of the special counsel’s investigation of his meetings with Russians. • Separately on Wednesday, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled that Mr. Trump’s practice of blocking Twitter users who criticize him is unconstitutional, a decision that will have implications far beyond the president. We spoke to some of those blocked. "
84,"SEOUL, South Korea — The moment had been portrayed by North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, as a show of good faith ahead of his meeting with President Trump: the destruction of North Korea’s only known nuclear test site. With foreign journalists watching on Thursday, the North Koreans detonated explosives to destroy tunnels and buildings at the site in the country’s remote mountains. But then, only hours later, Mr. Trump abruptly canceled the June 12 summit meeting, turning North Korea’s seeming gesture of good will into a potential embarrassment by its longtime enemy, the United States. Mr. Trump’s move blindsided the North Koreans so completely that the invited foreign journalists learned about the cancellation on their smartphones — even before some of their hosts did. One of the journalists, Will Ripley from CNN, read the text of Mr. Trump’s withdrawal letter to their official North Korean chaperones on the return train ride from the remote nuclear test site, Punggye-ri. “I can tell you there was a real sense of shock,” Mr. Ripley said in a phone interview with CNN. “They immediately got up and left.” Mr. Trump’s letter to Mr. Kim attributed the cancellation to what the American president called the “tremendous anger and open hostility” displayed by North Korean officials in recent statements. But the timing of the letter coincided almost precisely with North Korea’s public relations effort to present itself as transparent and flexible on the nuclear issue. "
85,"Elon Musk, the billionaire who has ambitions to colonize Mars and whose companies make electric vehicles and rockets, spent part of his Wednesday criticizing an already beleaguered and much-maligned group of humans on Earth. Yes, Mr. Musk, 46, the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla, could not help unloading on the news media — members of which have written articles, especially in recent months, about the many problems that have plagued his companies. (Among them: delays in the production of Model 3s; a deadly crash that occurred when a Model X’s Autopilot system was engaged; and questions about Tesla’s ability to pay off its debt amid continued quarterly losses.) In a series of tweets that ranged from bizarre to pithy, Mr. Musk called the media “holier-than-thou,” argued it had lost its credibility, blamed it for the election of President Trump, and suggested that journalists wrote negative stories about Tesla because they seek page views and because companies that make cars that rely on gas and diesel — some of Tesla’s competitors — “are among world’s biggest advertisers.” He also proposed creating what he called a “media credibility rating site,” which he suggested calling “Pravda” — the Russian word for “truth” and also the name of a longtime Communist newspaper.

87,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) A day after 200 faculty members at the University of Southern California demanded that the university president, C.L. Max Nikias, step down, the Academic Senate officially called on him to resign, saying that “new leadership is in the best interest of the university now and going forward.” Earlier Wednesday, the executive committee of the board of trustees announced plans to hire an independent lawyer and conduct a full investigation “into the misconduct and reporting failures that occurred at the U.S.C. student health center.” The vote and investigation, which is likely to take months, come a week after U.S.C. officials said they should have acted more quickly to dismiss and report Dr. George Tyndall, who was the primary gynecologist at the student health center for decades. An internal investigation had found that Dr. Tyndall performed pelvic exams inappropriately and made comments that amounted to sexual harassment, but university officials allowed the doctor to resign quietly with a payout, rather than report him to the medical board. The revelations have led to considerable outrage — The Los Angeles Times’s editorial board called for Mr. Nikias to step down and a petition started by a former student body president that also called for his resignation had gathered more than 3,000 signatures by Wednesday. The nearly unanimous vote of elected faculty representatives came hours after a packed town hall meeting with hundreds of professors who voiced frustration with Mr. Nikias and called for a no-confidence vote. There were 24 votes in favor of the resolution and four abstentions, but no votes opposing it. "
88,"The new super-skinny 432 Park is one of the five most expensive condo buildings in New York City, according to the most recent CityRealty 100, an index of Manhattan’s priciest condominiums. Some older buildings made the top five as well, including the 2008 Trump International, at 1 Central Park West, which has been appreciating in value. The index uses information on recent sales to calculate investment potential. And while there is some subjectivity involved in determining which 100 condominiums are included, the units in every building on the list must sell for at least $1,000 a square foot on average, and all buildings must be south of West 125th Street, Central Park North (110th Street) and East 96th Street. For the year ending March 31, 2018, the average price per square foot of homes in the buildings on the list was $2,445 — or about $1.22 million for a 500-square-foot apartment. But the top five buildings were much more expensive: In those condominiums, one square foot, about the amount of floor space occupied by a pair of Gucci slippers, sold for an average of more than $5,000. "
89,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday pulled out of a highly anticipated summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, accusing the North Koreans of bad faith and lamenting that “this missed opportunity is a truly sad moment in history.” The president made his announcement in a remarkably personal, at times mournful-sounding letter to Mr. Kim, North Korea’s leader, in which he cited the North’s “tremendous anger and open hostility” in recent public statements as the specific reason for canceling the meeting. Mr. Trump said later that the meeting, which had been scheduled for June 12 in Singapore, could still happen, and North Korea issued a strikingly conciliatory response, saying it hoped Mr. Trump would reconsider. The president emphasized that conciliatory tone with a tweet early Friday, saying “the warm and productive statement from North Korea” could lead “hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace.” But Mr. Trump also renewed talk of military action against the North and vowed to keep pressing economic sanctions, guaranteeing that for now, at least, his unlikely courtship of Mr. Kim will give way to a more familiar cycle of threats and tension. "
90,"President Trump on Thursday sent a letter to the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, canceling their highly anticipated summit on June 12 to discuss denuclearization. Mr. Trump dictated the entire letter on Thursday morning, according to a senior administration official. [Read more about the president’s decision to cancel the meeting.] The following is the text of that letter, as released by the White House, with annotations by The Times’s David E. Sanger. ______________________________ The Trump administration, especially Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has taken to calling Kim Jong-un “Chairman Kim.” It has echoes of Mao. The United States was “informed” of the request by South Korea, but Mr. Kim himself confirmed it to Mr. Pompeo. This was shorthand for saying, “Hey, this meeting was your idea.” "
91,"A Border Patrol agent shot and killed a woman who had crossed the border illegally near Laredo, Tex., on Wednesday after the officer came under attack, federal authorities said. The officer was searching for “illegal activity” in a culvert on a residential street in Rio Bravo, a border town about seven miles south of Laredo, when a group of undocumented immigrants started to hit him with “blunt objects,” United States Customs and Border Protection said. The officer, whose name was not released, fired at least one shot with his handgun, fatally striking the woman in the head. A woman who lives next door to the site of the shooting disputed the federal agency’s account of the events, saying that the property does not have a culvert and that she did not see any weapons that the group could have used. “They were on the very corner on that lot where there was a tree,” the woman, Marta V. Martinez, said in an interview Thursday morning. “There was no weapon. They were hiding.” The confrontation, which unfolded shortly before 12:30 p.m. on an empty lot about a quarter mile from the Rio Grande, came at a time when the Border Patrol agency is under intense pressure from President Trump to crack down on unauthorized immigration. Ms. Martinez said the gunshot rang out about 10 feet from her house. “I didn’t hear any yelling or ‘stop’ or ‘don’t run,’” she said. "
92,"In a sense, all books are black box flight data recorders: They put us at the scene and grant us access to conversations and events we couldn’t otherwise witness, even when the flights in question are only (or “only”) flights of fancy. But the metaphor is especially apt for this week’s list of recommended titles, which includes Rachel Slade’s “Into the Raging Sea” — a true-life disaster tale that’s heavily informed by the actual black box recovered from the wreck of the cargo ship El Faro. Other books this week drop us into the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide (“The Girl Who Smiled Beads”), unexpected motherhood (“And Now We Have Everything”) and Eleanor Roosevelt’s relationship with the reporter Lorena Hickok (“White Houses”). And since books, unlike black boxes, can also show us what people are thinking, we have two books puzzling out the fate of democracies, one taking on the modern world’s biggest ideas, and a posthumous collection of psychologically astute stories from a master of the form, William Trevor. As with El Faro, the best thing about black boxes is their ability to resurrect the dead. Gregory Cowles
Senior Editor, Books WHEN EINSTEIN WALKED WITH GÖDEL: Excursions to the Edge of Thought, by Jim Holt. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $28.) In these essays, taken from the last 20 years, Jim Holt writes about infinity and the infinitesimal, the illusion of time, the birth of eugenics, the so-called new atheism, smartphones and distraction, among other weighty subjects. This is an elegant history of recent ideas. “Holt is an amphibious kind of writer, so capably slipping from theology to cosmology to poetry, you’re reminded that specialization is a modern invention,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. “Part of what makes Holt so exciting is his ability to gather these disciplines under his shingle, to make their knottiest questions not only intelligible but enticing, without sacrificing rigor.” LAST STORIES, by William Trevor. (Viking, $26.) The great Irish writer, who died in 2016 at the age of 88, captured turning points in individual lives with effective understatement. This seemingly quiet but ultimately volcanic collection is his final gift to us, and it is filled with action sprung from human feeling. “His stories open with comments so blandly informational, so plain and unnoticeable, that they arouse no expectation and appear to promise little,” Cynthia Ozick writes in her review. “Yet such flat and unhurried beginnings are subversions concealing a powerful slyness. Trevor’s stories traffic in plots, fated or willed, and hurtful. They may be coiled in pity, but they are never benign.” FASCISM: A Warning, by Madeleine Albright with Bill Woodward. (Harper/HarperCollins, $27.99.) Drawing on her long experience in government service and as an educator, the former secretary of state warns about a new rise of fascism around the world, and cautions America not to turn its back. “Albright worries that Trump’s isolationism, protectionism and fondness for dictators are eroding America’s ability to lead and help solve international challenges,” our reviewer, Sheri Berman, writes. “Despite all this, Albright is hopeful. She ends her book referencing leaders like Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela, who helped their countries move past periods of intense violence and division. Democracy’s problems can, Albright assures us, be overcome — but only if we recognize history’s lessons and never take democracy for granted.” INTO THE RAGING SEA: Thirty-Three Mariners, One Megastorm, and the Sinking of the El Faro, by Rachel Slade. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $27.99.) Pieced together from texts, emails and black box recordings, this is a tense, moment-by-moment account of the 2015 sinking of the cargo ship El Faro during Hurricane Joaquin. According to Douglas Preston’s review, it “makes for a powerful and affecting story, beautifully handled by Slade, a journalist who clearly knows ships and the sea. The book tells of the heroic search-and-rescue operations, the hunt for the black box, the investigations and hearings and the nature of hurricanes. … One can’t help reading it, page after page, in disbelief and disgust.” "
93,"On its 60th anniversary, the civilian age of nuclear power in America appears to be almost over. But with the country awash in radioactive waste and plutonium stockpiled for warheads, the task of managing this atomic legacy grows ever more urgent. Opening a long-delayed waste repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada is imperative. President Dwight Eisenhower formally opened America’s first commercial nuclear power station at Shippingport, Pa., near Pittsburgh, on May 26, 1958. He declared it would “put the atom to work for the good of mankind, not his destruction.” His nuclear cheerleader, Lewis Strauss, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, had promised power “too cheap to meter.” Today, with cheap gas and falling prices for wind and solar energy, nuclear power is often now too expensive to sell. Six plants closed from 2013 to 2017. At least seven more — from the Oyster Creek plant in New Jersey to the Diablo Canyon plant in California — have been earmarked for final shutdown, often years before their operating licenses expire. About a quarter of the nation’s nuclear power plants don’t cover their operating costs, according to a recent analysis by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. America is still the world’s leading generator of nuclear power. But economics, more even than environmental concerns, is consigning nuclear power in its present form to history’s technological trash can. With well over a third of the country’s power reactors over 40 years old, the questions now are how long the accountants will allow them to keep going and what we will do with these power plants and the radioactive waste they produced. President Eisenhower’s “atoms for peace” program was a spinoff from the nuclear weapons industry. The world’s first large nuclear reactors, erected at Hanford in Washington State in the 1940s, turned uranium fuel into plutonium for use in nuclear warheads. The Cold War production at Hanford has left the country with all the plutonium it could possibly need. The surplus 54 tons, mostly stockpiled at a weapons assembly plant northeast of Amarillo, Tex., is enough to be recycled into tens of thousands of new warheads. "
94,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s chief of staff and a White House lawyer representing the president in the Russia investigation were present on Thursday at the start of two classified meetings requested by members of Congress to review sensitive material about the F.B.I.’s use of an informant in the inquiry. The two men left both meetings after sharing introductory remarks “to relay the president’s desire for as much openness as possible under the law” and before officials began to brief the lawmakers, the White House said in a statement. But the presence of John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, and Emmet T. Flood, the president’s lawyer, infuriated Democrats, and legal experts said their visit, at the least, could give off the appearance that the White House abused its authority to gain insight into an investigation that implicates the president. The president’s legal team was unapologetic. “We are certainly entitled to know” what information the government has on the F.B.I. informant, Rudolph W. Giuliani, another lawyer representing Mr. Trump in the investigation, said in an interview. The meeting “cuts off a long subpoena,” he said, referring to a legal fight for the information. At least two lawmakers participating in the briefings told Mr. Flood to his face that his presence was inappropriate. “Although he did not participate in the meetings which followed, as the White House’s attorney handling the special counsel’s investigation, his involvement — in any capacity — was entirely improper,” Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. "
95,"WASHINGTON — For more than 100 years, Jack Johnson’s legend as the first black heavyweight boxing champion has been undisputed, but his legacy had been tarnished by a racially tainted criminal conviction. His battles against white opponents, in the ring and outside of it, gave rise to “The Great White Hope” play and movie and he came to be lionized as a barrier breaker. But the criminal conviction from 1913 that most would find abhorrent today — for transporting a white woman across state lines — haunted Johnson well after his death in 1946 and motivated politicians and celebrities for years to advocate for a pardon, however symbolic. On Thursday in the Oval Office, Johnson posthumously found an unexpected champion: President Trump. Although his own record on civil rights has come under question, often harshly, Mr. Trump, flanked by boxing champions and Sylvester Stallone, the actor who brought the case to his attention, signed an order pardoning Johnson. The president called Johnson “a truly great fighter” who “had a tough life” but served 10 months in federal prison “for what many view as a racially motivated injustice.” Mr. Trump said the conviction took place during a “period of tremendous racial tension in the United States.” Mr. Trump has often found himself in the center of fiery debates over race and sports, and civil rights in general, repeatedly admonishing N.F.L. players, a majority of them black, who have knelt during the national anthem at games to protest racism and police brutality. "
96,"This isn’t diplomacy that President Trump is practicing with Kim Jong-un. It’s a roller-coaster ride — and it may be leading us to a more dangerous period in relations with North Korea. Trump again proved his exceptional talent on Thursday by following his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal with his cancellation of the June 12 summit meeting with Kim; few presidents manage such diplomatic ineptitude over a four-year term, let alone in a single month. Then a day later, Trump suggested that the meeting could be rescheduled after all — maybe even back on June 12. Man, those inscrutable Occidentals! I’ve been covering and visiting North Korea since the 1980s, and this may be the moment of greatest risk and opportunity. It is maddening that the U.S. is handling the moment so chaotically. North Korea’s initial response to the cancellation was calm and conciliatory, presumably because Kim wants the summit and because he wishes to appear more statesmanlike than Trump. If restraint doesn’t succeed soon, then the risk is that we’re back to confrontation — and if so, look out. Kim may choose to create a new crisis, perhaps by conducting a missile test or an atmospheric nuclear test (which could send radiation drifting toward the U.S.). The U.S. could respond to new tensions by sending B-1 bombers off the coast of North Korea. If North Korea scrambled aircraft or fired antiaircraft missiles, we could very quickly have an enormous escalation. "
97,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. For tactical reasons, I’m not a big fan of kneeling during the national anthem as a form of protest. I worry that kneeling N.F.L. players distract from their important political message — calling out police violence against African-Americans — and needlessly alienate otherwise persuadable people. (I’ve made the full case here and here and discussed the players’ broader protest movement here.) But if kneeling is problematic because it seems unpatriotic, the N.F.L.’s response is outrageous because it actually is unpatriotic. By instituting a policy yesterday to punish players who exercise their right of free expression by kneeling, the league is rejecting a basic American value. Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, and the league’s owners are evidently so insecure about their own patriotism that they have felt the need to bully their employees into a ritual sign of respect. “I am a fan of free speech on college campuses,” E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post tweeted. “So I ask my conservative friends who talk about this issue so much if they will also stand up for protesting #NFL players. Or do they think owners can make stadiums conservative ‘safe spaces’ where even silent protest is banned?” The Daily Beast’s Jay Michaelson notes that the N.F.L. is for-profit entertainment that receives huge subsidies from American taxpayers. His piece is headlined, “The NFL Can Punish Kneeling Players Because It’s a Private Corporation. Let’s Start Taxing It Like One.” "

Here’s the latest: • Would Italians really leave the eurozone? Europe seemed to have held off a series of far-right challenges, but the collapse of efforts to form a government in Italy, the bloc’s fourth-largest economy, shows that populism has not gone away. Now the euro is in the cross hairs. Italy’s leading populist parties — including the Five Star Movement, led by Luigi Di Maio, above — are pushing for new elections, which could become a referendum on the common currency. That would be a nightmare scenario for Brussels, writes our chief correspondent in Europe. Stocks tumbled on the fears that Italy might be headed toward quitting the euro, which fell to its weakest value against the dollar in nearly a year. The European Union’s budget commissioner apologized after prompting an uproar by suggesting that the markets would punish Italian voters if they voted for the populists. Here’s a look at why the concerns could escalate into a major crisis, and what it could mean for Italy, the euro, Europe and the world. "
99,"On Twitter on Tuesday, Roseanne Barr wrote that if “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby = vj.” The message referred to President Barack Obama’s former senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, and in it Ms. Barr traded on age-old racist ideas about black people and primates. Then she shared some incorrect nonsense about Chelsea Clinton marrying into the Soros family. It was the kind of thing Roseanne Barr has been doing online for years. This time, however, the backlash was immediate and vigorous. Ms. Barr apologized for her “joke” that wasn’t really a joke and said she was leaving Twitter as if Twitter were responsible for her racist behavior. That apology was not enough. ICM Partners, her agents, stopped representing her. The comedian Wanda Sykes, who was a consulting producer on the reboot of “Roseanne,” announced that she was quitting the show. Within a matter of hours, ABC canceled the new “Roseanne” and the original show’s reruns were pulled from TV Land, CMT and the Paramount Network. For once, a major network did the right thing. But before it did the right thing, it did the wrong thing. It is not new information that Roseanne Barr makes racist, Islamophobic and misogynistic statements and is happy to peddle all manner of dangerous conspiracy theories. ABC knew this when it greenlighted the “Roseanne” reboot. ABC knew this when it quickly renewed the reboot for a second season, buoyed, no doubt, by the show’s strong ratings. The cast, the writers and the producers knew what Ms. Barr stood for when they agreed to work on the show. Everyone involved made a decision to support the show despite its co-creator’s racism. They decided that their career ambitions, or desire to return to network television, or financial interests would best be served by looking the other way. It was only when Ms. Barr became an immediate liability that everyone involved finally looked at her racism and dealt with it directly. [Receive arguments and opinions on the pressing social issues and hidden stories around the World Cup right in your inbox.

I also watched the original version of “Roseanne” when it aired. I remember the Conner family as working class and solidly invested in the greater good of their community. They seemed to be liberals, which is antithetical to the Roseanne in the reboot, who is a working-class Trump supporter. Certainly, the Conner family may have changed political affiliations and become Republicans and there would be nothing wrong with that. "
100,"NASHVILLE — President Trump accused Democrats on Tuesday of siding with brutal immigrant gang members over American citizens and implored Republican voters to turn out in November’s midterm elections or risk the safety of their country. During a raucous rally in Nashville, Mr. Trump invoked fears of crimes committed by illegal immigrants, particularly by the transnational gang MS-13, to argue for stricter border policies, including his long-promised wall, and charged that Democrats were standing in the way. “They don’t want the wall, they want open borders,” Mr. Trump told the crowd. “They’re more interested in taking care of criminals than they are in taking care of you.” He worked an audience of about 5,500 people into a frenzy by recalling the term he used this month during a discussion of how difficult it was to target suspected undocumented immigrants, including criminal gang members, for deportation. “What was the name?” Mr. Trump asked. “Animals!” his cheering supporters screamed back. “If you want your communities to be safe, if you want your schools to be safe, if you want your country to be safe, then you must go out and get the Democrats the hell out of office,” Mr. Trump said. “Democrats have opposed every common-sense measure necessary to stop this horrendous scourge of crime, to dismantle MS-13 and to stop illegal immigration.” Mr. Trump was in Nashville to boost Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, who is running to succeed Senator Bob Corker, who is retiring. He savaged Phil Bredesen, the state’s former Democratic governor whom Ms. Blackburn is expected to face in November, calling him “an absolute, total tool of Chuck Schumer,” the Senate Democratic leader, and “of course, the MS-13 lover Nancy Pelosi,” he said, referring to the House Democratic leader. "
101,"— President Trump, speaking Tuesday night at a rally in Nashville Immigration and Customs Enforcement does not break down deportations according to gang affiliation, a spokesman for the agency said. But based on the number of arrests alone, Mr. Trump’s estimate of “thousands” is impossible. In the 2017 fiscal year — which began in October 2016 and ended in September 2017 — 796 members of MS-13, a transnational gang that has ties to El Salvador, were arrested, and 405 were arrested in the first quarter of the 2018 fiscal year, data that ICE provided to The New York Times shows. In all, that’s about 1,200 MS-13 members, and it’s likely not all of them have been removed. The time between an arrest and deportation can vary greatly, and backlog has stalled the process. In 2017, the average wait time for a hearing where a judge may order deportation was 685 days, according to data from TRAC, a research institute at Syracuse University. The number of MS-13 members who were arrested in the 2017 fiscal year was higher than the previous eight years, but ICE arrested more than 1,100 in the 2008 fiscal year and almost 1,300 in 2007. Those figures contradict Mr. Trump’s previous claims that “records” were set. The agency removed a total of 5,936 gang members in the 2017 fiscal year, and 1,082 in the 2018 fiscal year through March. It is unclear how many belong to MS-13. During the rally, Mr. Trump also reiterated many claims that The Times and others have previously debunked: that Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, supported MS-13 (she never said this), that illegal border crossings had declined 40 percent (they recently increased), and that tax cuts he signed into law last year were the largest in history (they rank 12th). He also incorrectly described other countries as not “sending their best” through the diversity visa program (applicants enter of their own volition), claimed construction had begun on his border wall (it hasn’t), and said that the suspect in the Manhattan truck attack in October had sponsored two dozen family members through “chain migration” (this is implausible). "
102,"Ivanka Trump abruptly left a conference call on Tuesday about a coming fitness event after receiving questions about her company’s trademarks in China and her father’s exercise regimen. White House officials insisted that she had always been scheduled to leave. Ms. Trump and Holli M. Richmond, the director of the White House Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition, both hosted the call with reporters before a field day President Trump will host Wednesday at the White House. At the outset, a White House official said that Ms. Trump would take a few questions before departing for a meeting, and that Ms. Richmond would handle the rest. But the first reporter to ask a question broached the number of trademarks that China recently awarded Ms. Trump’s private, eponymous brand. Around the same time, Ms. Trump’s father, the president, endorsed saving the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, a move that surprised several people in his own administration. The company was left paralyzed after it was recently banned from buying American technology components for seven years as punishment for breaking American sanctions against some countries, including Iran and North Korea. When the reporter, from NBC, asked whether Ms. Trump would weigh in on the matter, the official, Ninio Fetalvo, said that he had to “refer those questions to the press office.” He quickly moved on to the next question. Ms. Trump, a top-ranking White House official, rarely takes questions from the news media in uncontrolled settings. The issue of overlap between her brand and her work at the White House has frequently raised eyebrows, including among ethics watchdogs. Later on the call, a question came up about whether Mr. Trump has changed his fitness and diet routine, which Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, his White House physician at the time, had recommended this year. Ms. Trump, Mr. Fetalvo said, had departed for another meeting and could not take the question. "

Here is a look at who is meeting with whom, and what they might be talking about. _____ • President Trump told Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in March 2017 that he should reverse his decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Mr. Sessions refused, but the previously unreported confrontation is being investigated by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. "
104,"WASHINGTON — Riding in a motorcade in Lima, Peru, shortly after the 2016 election, President Barack Obama was struggling to understand Donald J. Trump’s victory. “What if we were wrong?” he asked aides riding with him in the armored presidential limousine. He had read a column asserting that liberals had forgotten how important identity was to people and had promoted an empty cosmopolitan globalism that made many feel left behind. “Maybe we pushed too far,” Mr. Obama said. “Maybe people just want to fall back into their tribe.” His aides reassured him that he still would have won had he been able to run for another term and that the next generation had more in common with him than with Mr. Trump. Mr. Obama, the first black man elected president, did not seem convinced. “Sometimes I wonder whether I was 10 or 20 years too early,” he said. In the weeks after Mr. Trump’s election, Mr. Obama went through multiple emotional stages, according to a new book by his longtime adviser Benjamin J. Rhodes. At times, the departing president took the long view, at other points, he flashed anger. He called Mr. Trump a “cartoon” figure who cared more about his crowd sizes than any particular policy. And he expressed rare self-doubt, wondering whether he had misjudged his own influence on American history. Set to be published next week by Random House, Mr. Rhodes’s memoir, “The World as It Is,” offers a peek into Mr. Obama’s tightly sealed inner sanctum from the perspective of one of the few people who saw him up close through all eight years of his presidency. Few moments shook Mr. Obama more than the decision by voters to replace him with a candidate who had questioned his very birth. Mr. Rhodes served as Mr. Obama’s deputy national security adviser through some of the most consequential points of his presidency, including decisions to authorize the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, send more troops to Afghanistan, pull most troops out of Iraq, restore diplomatic relations with Cuba, seal a nuclear agreement with Iran, intervene militarily in Libya and refuse to intervene militarily in Syria. "
105,"Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, audibly choked up during Wednesday’s press briefing as she answered a student’s question about school shootings. The student, Benje Choucroun, 13, was at the White House covering a children’s fitness event for Time for Kids, but was called on as he sat among the White House press corps. He said his school recently had a lockdown drill. Reading from a sheet of paper, he said that one thing that affected students’ mental health was “the worry about the fact that we or our friends could get shot at school.” “Specifically,” the boy asked, “can you tell me what the administration has done and will do to prevent these senseless tragedies?” Ms. Sanders, her voice breaking at times, responded: “I think that as a kid, and certainly as a parent, there is nothing that could be more terrifying for a kid to go to school and not feel safe. So I’m sorry that you feel that way.” She continued: “This administration takes it seriously, and the school safety commission that the president convened is meeting this week again, an official meeting, to discuss the best ways forward and how we can do every single thing within our power to protect kids in our schools, and to make them feel safe and make their parents feel good about dropping them off.” President Trump has called for action after some high-profile school shootings, but little has come of it beyond the creation of the commission, which is overseen by Betsy DeVos, the education secretary. After a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., killed 17 people in February, Mr. Trump said he would look at stricter background checks and raising the minimum age for buying assault weapons. He also suggested arming teachers, giving them a bonus to carry guns. Those proposals have gone nowhere. He later said on Twitter that there was “not much political support (to put it mildly)” on raising the minimum age. In the only tangible action, Attorney General Jeff Sessions introduced regulations in March to ban so-called bump stocks, a device used in last year’s massacre in Las Vegas. But the ban has not gone into effect and could still face legal challenges from gun rights groups. "
106,"It was an incredibly exciting time to be a writer on “Roseanne.” The revived ABC sitcom was the No. 1 new show in the country, delivering an audience that network television had not seen in years. The show was quickly renewed for another season, giving everyone a sense of accomplishment, not to mention job security. But for all the success, there was also a vague sense of foreboding. The writers’ social media accounts were flooded with negative comments. Articles posted online criticized jokes and plots. Their friends in the liberal enclave of Los Angeles would occasionally tsk-tsk that they worked on the show. And, of course, there was Roseanne Barr, the show’s star and co-creator, and her history of volatile public comments. “It was hard for us once we started airing and we started to see some of the stuff that came out,” said Bruce Rasmussen, an executive producer of the series. “It was just brutal: ‘How dare they give her a show? How dare they write for her?’ “It was a certain amount of pressure,” he continued. “You’re the No. 1 show, and people are coming after you on the web and you’re getting attacked by 50 percent of the press.” In the wake of ABC’s cancellation of “Roseanne” on Tuesday, only hours after Ms. Barr posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, those who worked for the network and the show were still trying to come to grips with how everything had collapsed so suddenly. "
107,"HOUSTON — As Dennis Rivera-Sarmiento sat in a detention center 80 miles away from his Texas home this past winter, clad in a blue inmate uniform, he could see his high school diploma slipping further from his reach. Graduation was in June, but a schoolyard scuffle with a girl who he said had called him a racial epithet had gotten him arrested by his high school’s police officer. Then a state law that required the Harris County Sheriff’s Office to cooperate with federal immigration officers flagged him for deportation, back to his native Honduras, from which he and his family had fled five years ago. The case of the “quiet kid who was good at soccer” hauled from high school to a deportation center turned Mr. Rivera-Sarmiento into a cause célèbre in Houston, a textbook case of what immigration advocacy groups fear could happen as schools tighten discipline in the wake of school shootings, the police ratchet up sweeps for gang members and local law enforcement draws closer to the federal immigration authorities. The school, the community and plenty of lawyers rallied to Mr. Rivera-Sarmiento’s side, and on Saturday, he will don a green graduation gown and cross the stage as part of the class of 2018 at Stephen F. Austin High School. But beyond that stage, his future is decidedly uncertain as he awaits an asylum hearing that will determine his future in the United States. “I actually don’t think this is real,” Mr. Rivera-Sarmiento, 19, said. “I never thought I’d be graduating. I thought I would be in Honduras right now.” "
108,"It was a long night of Twitter for Roseanne Barr. Hours after ABC canceled her reboot of “Roseanne” because of her racist tweet about a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, Ms. Barr returned to the platform and posted more than 100 times. She tweeted, retweeted, reply-tweeted and, in many cases, deleted tweets from her account, @therealroseanne, which has been active since March 2011 and has 774,000 followers. Ms. Barr’s overnight barrage comprised apologetic remarks, aggrieved statements, personal attacks, fond messages to her supporters and pointed references to the shadowy conspiracy theories that have long been a staple of her social media presence. The stream of tweets began hours after she declared, “I apologize. I am now leaving Twitter.” After two tweets apologizing again to the former presidential adviser, Valerie Jarrett, Ms. Barr addressed her supporters directly at 12:03 a.m. Eastern time, telling them not to defend her — even if she thought it was “sweet” of them to try. Losing her show, she wrote, was nothing compared with being labeled a racist over a single tweet. “That I regret even more,” she wrote. An hour earlier, in a tweet she later deleted, she apologized “to the hundreds of people, and wonderful writers (all liberal) and talented actors who lost their jobs.” Not long before that, she retweeted a post from the account @LegendaryEnergy, which has more than 15,000 followers, that defended the post by Ms. Barr that had started the firestorm: a tweet likening Ms. Jarrett to the Muslim Brotherhood and “Planet of the Apes.” "
109,"WASHINGTON — Virginia’s Republican-controlled Senate voted on Wednesday to open Medicaid to an additional 400,000 low-income adults next year, making it all but certain that the state will join 32 others that have already expanded the public health insurance program under the Affordable Care Act. Republican lawmakers in the state had blocked Medicaid expansion for four straight years, but a number of them dropped their opposition after their party almost lost the House of Delegates in elections last fall and voters named health care as a top issue. The vote, on a budget bill that included the Medicaid expansion, came almost three months after the House approved a similar plan. Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat also elected last fall, has been a vocal proponent of the expansion and can now claim a victory that his predecessor, Terry McAuliffe, desperately wanted but never got. The House passed the Senate bill within hours; it will now go to Mr. Northam’s desk. The measure includes a requirement that many adult recipients who don’t have a disability either work or volunteer as a condition of receiving Medicaid — a provision that was crucial to getting enough Republicans on board. “This budget is the culmination of five years of effort to bring our taxpayer dollars home from Washington and expand Medicaid,” Mr. Northam, a pediatrician, said in a statement. “As a doctor, I’m so proud of the significant step we’ve taken together to help Virginians get quality, affordable health care.” The Affordable Care Act gave states the option to expand Medicaid starting in 2014, and required the federal government to pay no less than 90 percent of the cost. Opponents said that even 10 percent was unaffordable for most states, and that the federal government might renege on paying its share, especially if the health law were repealed. "
110,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Federal regulators unveiled a sweeping plan to soften the Volcker Rule, opening the door for big banks to resume trading activities that were restricted under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, above, said it would streamline “overly complex and inefficient requirements.” The changes would give big banks the freedom to engage in more complicated — and possibly riskier — trading. Consumer advocates and other financial watchdogs say that they would allow a return to the Wild West days on Wall Street. ____ 2. President Trump weighed in on the cancellation of “Roseanne” — sort of. Referencing an apology from the parent company of ABC, Mr. Trump noted that he hadn’t gotten his own “for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC.” "
111,"Of course ABC and its parent company Disney were right to cancel the sitcom “Roseanne” after its eponymous star, Roseanne Barr, wrote a racist tweet. There are necessary taboos and essential decencies in every morally healthy society. Writing that Obama administration aide Valerie Jarrett was the baby of “Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes” violates these in the foulest of ways. This is not a First Amendment issue. Constitutional rights are what you’re entitled to in the public sphere, not as an employee of a private corporation. Barr’s speech has not been curtailed; she remains free to opine (and mostly free to tweet) to her heart’s content. She’s just not free to do so while getting $250,000 a show from an employer whose reputation she stained and whose values she traduced. This is not a “free speech” issue — using “free speech” in the broader, less legalistic sense of the term. The University of Chicago president, Robert Zimmer, has made the case that institutions like his, though not strictly subject to the First Amendment, should nonetheless encourage the free and vigorous exchange of ideas for the sake of fostering intellectual excellence. That’s right. But what Barr tweeted wasn’t an idea. It was a slur. This is not a “double standards” issue. With his trademark combination of puerile self-pity and fang-toothed nastiness, Donald Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday to denounce Disney’s chairman, Robert Iger, for not apologizing to him for the “HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC.” But he’s the ultimate public figure, whereas Jarrett is a private citizen subjected to unprovoked racial attack by an ABC employee. That the president fails or refuses to appreciate the distinction is the thousandth reminder of his unfitness for office. This is not a “one bad tweet” issue. In March, I argued that Kevin Williamson, the conservative writer briefly hired by The Atlantic, should be judged by the totality of his work, not by a vile tweet (and, as it later turned out, a discussion on a podcast) in which he seemed to suggest that women who get abortions should be hanged. Williamson insists his comments were misunderstood, but that’s another story. The relevant question here is: What’s the “totality” of Barr’s work, at least when it comes to political and racial questions? John Podhoretz, the editor of Commentary magazine, summed it up perfectly when he described Barr as “a boor,” a “notorious believer and propagator of conspiracy theories related to 9/11,” and, in all, “not merely a loose cannon but a MIRVed ICBM ready to go off in all directions at any time.” "
112,"The boos cascaded from the stands, wafting over Monument Park, turning a moment of between-inning indifference at Yankee Stadium into a visceral spirit cleansing. That it was directed toward a former mayor was no surprise; sports fans excel at heaping opprobrium on political leaders when they intrude into their temples. But that it occurred to Rudolph W. Giuliani, on the occasion of his 74th birthday on Memorial Day, in a stadium that has long been a safe space, was different — a reflection, perhaps, of how Mr. Giuliani and the city he once led have drifted apart. A brief video of the booing quickly made the rounds on social media, heartening many Democrats angry at Mr. Giuliani’s strenuous defense of President Trump on television. “I used to boo him 20 years ago,” said Ruben Diaz Jr., 45, the Bronx borough president. “But if there was one place in the whole world he was popular, it was inside Yankee Stadium. Boy have times changed.” "
113,"WASHINGTON — The former acting F.B.I. director, Andrew G. McCabe, wrote a confidential memo last spring recounting a conversation that offered significant behind-the-scenes details on the firing of Mr. McCabe’s predecessor, James B. Comey, according to several people familiar with the discussion. Mr. Comey’s firing is a central focus of the special counsel’s investigation into whether President Trump tried to obstruct the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia. Mr. McCabe has turned over his memo to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. In the document, whose contents have not been previously reported, Mr. McCabe described a conversation at the Justice Department with the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, in the chaotic days last May after Mr. Comey’s abrupt firing. Mr. Rosenstein played a key role in the dismissal, writing a memo that rebuked Mr. Comey over his handling of an investigation into Hillary Clinton. But in the meeting at the Justice Department, Mr. Rosenstein added a new detail: He said the president had originally asked him to reference Russia in his memo, the people familiar with the conversation said. Mr. Rosenstein did not elaborate on what Mr. Trump had wanted him to say. To Mr. McCabe, that seemed like possible evidence that Mr. Comey’s firing was actually related to the F.B.I.’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, and that Mr. Rosenstein helped provide a cover story by writing about the Clinton investigation. One person who was briefed on Mr. Rosenstein’s conversation with the president said Mr. Trump had simply wanted Mr. Rosenstein to mention that he was not personally under investigation in the Russia inquiry. Mr. Rosenstein said it was unnecessary and did not include such a reference. Mr. Trump ultimately said it himself when announcing the firing. "
114,"In an attempt to deter migrant families from crossing the border, the Trump administration has been separating children from their parents and sending them to different shelters or foster homes, where they may be kept apart for weeks or even months. This policy, which has affected approximately 700 children so far, violates basic human rights and horrifies any parent with enough imagination to put themselves in the place of these immigrants. As members of a team of researchers who have investigated the impact of separating children from their parents during early childhood, we were struck by another aspect of this news: In an effort to increase security, the Trump administration has hit upon a policy that we know is actually likely to increase delinquency and criminality among these children in the future. While trying to protect American citizens, the administration may be placing them in greater jeopardy. If we have learned nothing else in the past 50 years of research on child development, it is that children do best in families and that violating this norm has terrible effects. In a long-term study of children separated from their parents early in life and raised for periods without family members, we and our colleagues — Nathan Fox, Kathryn Humphreys, Katie McLaughlin and Charley Zeanah — found a profound impact on their cognitive ability, social function, mental health and brain development. In early 2001, in Bucharest, Romania, we began studying orphaned and abandoned infants ranging in age from 6 months to 30 months. Some of the children remained in the care of institutions for the majority of their lives, while others left institutional care early in life and were placed with loving families. We have followed these children since to observe their mental health and emotional well-being, their brain structure and function, and their cognitive ability. We found that children who remained in institutions had lower I.Q.s than their peers who were randomly assigned to family care. The I.Q. gap decreased as the children grew older, but it has not been erased by time. The same can be said for their “executive functions,” which include their ability to plan and to regulate their emotions and behavior. "
115,"— President Trump, speaking at the signing of “right to try” legislation on Wednesday The legislation that Mr.  Trump signed into law on Wednesday allows terminally ill patients to seek access to experimental medicine that is not yet fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Whether it will save “hundreds of thousands of lives” is a prediction that is, at best, unclear. But the effect of similar laws in some states has been muted. A program known as compassionate use, or expanded access, has been in place since the 1970s. It allows patients with a serious disease or condition to obtain experimental medicines; the Food and Drug Administration says it authorizes 99 percent of the requests for expanded access that it receives. The new national law — like similar laws in more than three dozen states — allows patients and doctors to ask drug companies directly for access to the experimental drugs, rather than wait for  approval by the agency. Yet these laws “do not ensure that manufacturers will provide the drug or that insurance companies will cover the cost,” according to a policy report from Rice University. Obtaining the medicines from manufacturers can be more cumbersome than going through the Food and Drug Administration’s existing program, the report found. Colorado enacted the first right-to-try law in 2014. Since then, “there have been no documented cases of anyone receiving access, because of a right-to-try law, to an experimental product that would not have been available via the F.D.A.’s expanded access program,” a 2017 study by researchers from New York University concluded. Alison Bateman-House, a professor of medical ethics and an author of the study, called it “extremely unlikely” that the national right-to-try law would directly save hundreds of thousands of lives, given that drug companies are using — and accustomed to — the existing  process. “It’s impossible to tell how many people will be helped by the federal right-to-try law,” said Christina Sandefur, the executive vice president of the Goldwater Institute, the conservative group that spearheaded the effort. But “if it saves one person, it’s worth it,” she said, adding, “For the patients who are turned away from clinical trials and who are unable to navigate the complex expanded access process, right to try will give them a last chance — and the right to hope.” While the law itself may have a minimal effect, Dr. Bateman-House said, the right-to-try movement and the attention that Mr. Trump has drawn to it are positive steps toward raising patients’ awareness for experimental treatment. She predicted that the number of patients asking for developing medicines will increase — just under the current expanded access program. "
116,"After news came from Kiev on Tuesday that a Russian journalist critical of Vladimir Putin had been shot dead, it did not take long for the Kremlin’s denial machinery to shift into high gear. Another case of Russophobia, cried government officials and their media acolytes, anticipating that Russia would be blamed. An attempt to mar the World Cup soccer tournament; a typical example of Ukraine’s “bloody crimes and total impunity.” The reality turned out to be a bit more complicated when the journalist, Arkady Babchenko, appeared at a news conference the next day very much alive, and Ukrainian security services announced that his “murder” had been a sting operation to foil a plot by Russian security services to kill him. Ukrainian authorities certainly must explain why they felt it necessary to compromise journalistic integrity to stage this bizarre episode; they have doubtless supplied fodder to conspiracy theorists and cynical denouncers of “fake news” everywhere. One thing is certain: The Kremlin will seize on this official deceit to show the lengths to which its enemies will go to tarnish Russia. That has been Russia’s reaction to all accusations of foul play, whether it’s the well-documented charges by the Netherlands, Australia and other nations that it was responsible for downing a Malaysian jetliner over Ukraine in 2014, killing 298; or the British accusation that Russia was most likely behind the poisoning of a double agent and his daughter in England; or the charge by American intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the presidential campaign. Each such accusation is met by a barrage of official denials on state television and mockery on social media. In the official version Russia is always the victim of a dastardly and demeaning Western campaign; it was the Ukrainians who shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 to make Russia look bad; it was the British who poisoned Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, and when she gave an interview to Reuters, it was obvious she was coerced. This is not so different from the response of President Trump to the mounting evidence that aides and advisers to his campaign had numerous questionable contacts with Russian representatives seeking to aid his election. He claims it’s all a sinister plot by agents of the “deep state” or former President Barack Obama to plant “spies” to undercut his campaign. Such instinctive denials were a fixture of the Soviet Union, where the Communist Party treated any questioning of its infallibility as a crime. Speaking the truth was dangerous. Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s impassioned essay “Live Not by Lies” appeared the day before he was exiled in 1974; Mikhail Gorbachev’s most radical reform was “glasnost,” or openness. In Vladimir Putin’s Russia, bluster and lying have been restored to primacy. "
117,"We as a nation have crossed so many ugly lines recently, yet one new policy of President Trump’s particularly haunts me. I’m speaking of the administration’s tactic of seizing children from desperate refugees at the border. “I was given only five minutes to say goodbye,” a Salvadoran woman wrote in a declaration in an A.C.L.U. lawsuit against the government, after her 4- and 10-year-old sons were taken from her. “My babies started crying when they found out we were going to be separated.” “In tears myself, I asked my boys to be brave, and I promised we would be together soon. I begged the woman who took my children to keep them together so they could at least have each other.” This mother, who for her protection is identified only by her initials, J.I.L., said that while in El Salvador she was severely beaten in front of her family by a gang, and she then fled the country to save the lives of her children. Who among us would not do the same? J.I.L. noted that she had heard that her children might have been separated and sent to two different foster homes, and added: “I am scared for my little boys.” Is this really who we are? As a parent, as the son of a refugee myself, I find that in this case Trump’s policy has veered from merely abhorrent to truly evil. "
118,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is poised to impose steel and aluminum tariffs on the European Union, and possibly on Canada and Mexico, this week when a temporary exemption expires as trade talks remain at an impasse, according to a person familiar with the White House discussions. The threat of tariffs was supposed to force trading partners into quickly agreeing to United States concessions, including limiting imports of steel and aluminum and other trade terms that favor American companies and workers. In addition to the metal tariffs, President Trump has threatened to impose levies on imported automobiles, the bulk of which comes from allies like Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Japan and the European Union. The White House has tried to leverage the tariffs to get Canada and Mexico to agree to its demands on a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and it has pressured Europe to make trade concessions on other fronts, including cutting the amount of metals the bloc exports to the United States. So far, the Trump administration’s aggressive approach appears to have only hardened the resolve among the United States’ closest allies to fight back against Mr. Trump’s demands. Discussions between the countries are continuing and Mr. Trump could ultimately decide not to impose tariffs on any of the trading partners. But with the exemption deadline quickly approaching and the countries still far apart on many issues, a resolution could be tough to pull off by Friday. "
119,"The toppling of Roseanne Barr — from her racist late-night tweet to the early-morning backlash and ABC’s axing of her highly rated show — took less than 12 hours. That is the equivalent of hyperspeed for businesses and brands that are accustomed to taking their time when it comes to high-stakes decisions about key employees who land in hot water. But the intensity and immediacy of the social media age have turned corporate crisis management into an exercise where minutes, and sometimes seconds, count. And the praise that ABC executives received this week for their swift response will most likely serve as an example to other businesses facing public relations disasters. “It’s the concept of the golden hour of crisis response,” said Kara Alaimo, who teaches public relations and reputation management at Hofstra University. “It’s a term borrowed from emergency medicine: Everyone knows if you get a heart attack victim to the hospital in the first hour, they’re more likely to survive.” Ms. Alaimo added: “If you respond quickly, you get to frame the narrative, rather than allowing other people to frame your actions and motivations for you. That is the key to surviving a crisis on social media.” Still, every public-relations fiasco is unique, a circumstantial stew of cultural context, financial consequence and the particular flavor of the offense. In some ways, experts said, ABC and its corporate parent, the Walt Disney Company, benefited from the sheer outrageousness of Ms. Barr’s remark, which depicted Valerie Jarrett, an African-American woman and one of President Barack Obama’s closest advisers, as the product of “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes.” "

121,"On Tuesday, ABC canceled its “Roseanne” revival, the network’s first No. 1 show in 24 years, after its star Roseanne Barr referred to Valerie Jarrett, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, as the offspring of the “Muslim Brotherhood & Planet of the Apes.” The decision prompted surprise, relief and schadenfreude from many on the left, who already regarded the sitcom — in which Barr’s character, like Barr herself, is a supporter of President Trump and his radical racist authoritarian ideology — as an alarming bellwether of Trumpism’s slide into normalcy. Meanwhile, the right-wing backlash is unfolding as scripted: the usual cries of censorship, the usual recriminations about liberal celebrities who once said something mean, the usual lamentations about politically correct overreach, the usual free-market fetishists suddenly oppressed by the marketplace of ideas. Barr attributed her gleeful antebellum-vintage racism to the sleep aid Ambien and played down her comment as a joke (yes, we know, a racist one). Trump — who himself referred to some immigrants as “animals” this month — predictably joined in, whining that Disney’s chief executive, Bob Iger, “never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC.” Right-wing Twitter (including Barr’s own feed) is now thick with similar sentiments: Here is Joy Behar saying something cutting about Trump. Here is Jimmy Kimmel. Here is Michelle Wolf. Why didn’t the outrage mob come for them? One important difference is that it is possible, or at least up for debate, for Trump’s decorum, health care plan, tax bill or hair to deserve mockery. It is not possible, and well beyond the realm of debate, for black people to deserve five centuries of racialized brutality and dehumanization. Chattel slavery in America ended 153 years ago. I am only 36 years old, and when my father was born, there were black Americans alive who remembered being the property of white people. Slavery is not our distant past; it is yesterday. Descendants of slaves (again, only a few generations removed) have never been compensated for the hundreds of years of unpaid forced labor upon which white Americans built generational wealth and economic stability. The culturally and legislatively enforced poverty, subjugation and mass incarceration of black people continue to this day, while white supremacist violence saturates our news media, whether it’s identified as such or not.

124,"Representative Diane Black, a Republican who is a candidate for Tennessee governor, drew criticism this week for saying that the “root” causes of gun violence included the “deterioration of family,” violent movies and widely available pornography. A spokesman for Ms. Black’s campaign said she was referring to factors that contribute to violence. “It’s no surprise that the liberal media would misconstrue the views of conservative Christians,” the spokesman, Chris Hartline, said in an email on Wednesday. “Diane, like many others, believes that the breakdown of family values and social structures is a contributing factor to violence. That’s clear if you actually listen to her words instead of reading clickbait headlines.” Ms. Black, a gun rights supporter who opposes firearm restrictions, made the comments in a meeting with local pastors last week, according to HuffPost, which obtained audio that was recorded at the gathering. “Why do we see kids being so violent?” she can be heard asking. “Because as a nurse I go back to root cause. And I think there’s a couple.” “I think it’s deterioration of family,” she added. “They don’t have that good support system,” which leads children “in the wrong direction.” Idle hands are the Devil’s workshop, Ms. Black said. She then brought up “violent movies” as being part of the problem, a claim that experts have disputed. "
125,"WASHINGTON — Kim Kardashian West met with President Trump at the White House on Wednesday, and the subject seemed an unlikely one for a glamorous celebrity and cosmetics mogul: prison reform. But the reason for Ms. Kardashian West’s interest is the case of Alice Johnson, a 63-year-old Tennessee woman who, according to the nonprofit project Can-Do, was sentenced in 1996 to life in prison on charges related to cocaine possession and money laundering. Brittany K. Barnett, a member of Ms. Johnson’s legal team, said Ms. Kardashian West and her lawyer, Shawn Chapman Holley, were scheduled to meet with a group of White House officials — including the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. Their goal was to raise the issue of clemency for Ms. Johnson. They ended up meeting with not just the initial group, but with the president, too. “It was very general,” Ms. Barnett said of the meeting. “We just don’t know, but it seems like the meeting was positive, and it is in President Trump’s hands now as to what he decides to do.” The president posted on Twitter shortly afterward about what he called a “great meeting,” and he said that they had discussed “prison reform and sentencing.” "
126,"Two weeks after a student armed with a sawed-off shotgun and a revolver killed 10 people at a high school outside Houston, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas on Wednesday proposed spending more than $100 million to put more police and armed guards on school campuses and expand programs to identify students at risk of engaging in mass violence. Mr. Abbott, a Republican, also proposed stepping up security at schools by limiting the number of entrances and exits, and installing alarms specifically designated to warn of active shooters. “You have to know who is coming into the school, and you have to know who is leaving it,” Mr. Abbott said. But his school safety plan contained only modest changes to gun laws: He proposed requiring parents to keep firearms locked away from children under the age of 18, a tightening of current law which requires such controls for families with children younger than 17. He also proposed improvements to the system for reporting felony convictions and adjudications of mental illness, both of which trigger prohibitions on gun possession under federal law. And he asked state legislators to “consider the merits” of passing a so-called red flag law that would allow the police, family members or a school employee to petition a judge to temporarily take guns away from someone deemed a threat to themselves or others. Texas would become one of only about 10 states with red flag laws, if legislators were to pass such a law, though proposals for similar legislation are pending in more than a dozen other states. “I will never allow Second Amendment rights to be infringed, but I will always promote responsible gun ownership, which includes keeping guns safe and keeping them out of the hands of criminals,” Mr. Abbott said. He said his aim was not to expand regulations, but help schools accomplish what they already want to do — protect students. “They don’t need mandates from the state,” he said. “They need assistance from the state.” "
127,"WASHINGTON — Federal agents are struggling to stop opioid smugglers who are reaping vast profits, according to interviews and documents, as the number of Americans dying from drug overdoses continues to rise. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security say the drugs are shipped in such minute amounts that detecting them among cargo in a tractor-trailer is close to impossible. That the drugs increasingly are bought  online and shipped directly to buyers — either through the Postal Service or commercial couriers like FedEx and UPS — makes inspections all the more difficult. “The sheer logistical nature of trying to pick out which packages contain opioids makes it much more challenging,” said Robert E. Perez, an acting executive assistant commissioner at United States Customs and Border Protection, an arm of the department. “It’s unlike anything we’ve encountered.” China is the largest source of illegal fentanyl for American buyers, officials said, and buyers are increasingly paying with digital currencies for drugs that are shipped through other countries — often Mexico or Canada — to reduce the risk of the opioids being tracked and seized by customs officials. “When you’re dealing with very small, minute quantities, it’s kind of like death by a thousand cuts,” said Patrick J. Lechleitner, the special agent in charge of the Washington office of Homeland Security Investigations, a division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “You used to have the tractor-trailer running up the interstate, with its contraband, that had to be met by someone and distributed,” Mr. Lechleitner said. “Now, you have an individual sitting somewhere in middle America ordering this thing, and it arrives as a parcel at their house.” "
128,"NEW YORK — Banks and energy companies surged Wednesday and smaller companies made huge gains as stocks got back almost all the ground they lost the day before. Investors reversed course as they hoped Italy would be able to avoid a new round of elections after all. Financial companies rallied as bond yields turned higher and energy companies rose along with U.S. crude oil, which busted out of a five-day losing streak. The shift came after Carlo Cottarelli, nominated to be Italy's next prime minister, said there were ""new possibilities"" to form a government. Stocks had plunged the previous day as investors expected gridlock to be resolved with new elections that could have turned into a yes-or-no referendum deciding whether Italy would continue to use the euro. JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade, said the market often reacts irregularly to political events like the uncertainty in Italy or tensions between the U.S. and North Korea: stocks often fall fast and then recover in quick fashion. That process can sometimes repeat itself weeks or months later. ""If there's no follow-up news, they tend to come back near where they started,"" he said. ""I wouldn't count on it being done for the summer."" The S&P 500 index jumped 34.15 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,724.01. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 306.33 points, or 1.3 percent, to 24,667.78. The Nasdaq composite gained 65.86 points, or 0.9 percent, to 7,462.45. "
129,"Before reading the article: Read the introductory paragraphs in today’s Article of the Day: Now consider: What is the purpose of this Times article? Then, before reading the rest of the article, if you have you been following these immigration-related news stories, explain what you think you understand about what is going on with immigrant children. Now, read the article, “Did the Trump Administration Separate Immigrant Children From Parents and Lose Them?,” and answer the following questions: 1. Who are the 1,475 unaccounted-for children who have been labeled “lost”? Why did they come to the United States? From where? In what way are they unaccounted-for? 2. What is the Trump administration’s policy on separating migrant children from their parents at the border? Is this a new policy? 3. How did these two stories — the 1,500 “lost” children and the Trump administration’s policy of separating children from families — get confused on social media? (You can look at this tweet as an example of this confusion.) 4. What will happen to undocumented immigrants — both adults and children — under the new “zero tolerance” policy, and why? Finally, tell us more about what you think: What do you think should be done with undocumented children — both children accompanied by adults and children arriving alone — who enter the United States either illegally or by presenting themselves at ports of entry seeking asylum? Why? Do you agree with the Trump administration that children — for example, 4-year-olds or 9-year olds — should be separated from their parents when they cross the border illegally? Do you think this “zero tolerance” policy is good public policy? Is it a fair and just government response to illegal immigration — as the attorney general said, “If you don’t like that, then don’t smuggle children over our border”? Or do you think the policy is ”not a response worthy of a great and humane nation,” and that it is “cruel” and heartless,” as critics stated in this article? Explain your answer.

130,"O
ne winter morning in a conventional suburb outside Albany, N.Y., Nancy Salzman, the 63-year-old president of a self-improvement company named Nxivm, sat on a mahogany-colored stool in her kitchen. Her tasteful home was surrounded by other Nxivm members’ modest townhouses or capacious stone mansions that seemed to spring up out of nowhere, like mushrooms, on the suburban streets. In Salzman’s den, a photo of her with her two adult daughters hung on a wall, the three of them wearing smiles as wide as ancient Greek masks of comedy; the same happy photo served as the wallpaper on Salzman’s laptop. A hairless Sphynx cat prowled the lovely buffet of croissants and fruit on her kitchen island. Salzman, an extremely fit woman wearing the type of thin athleisure sweatshirt that’s all the rage with the middle-aged bourgeoisie these days, turned her attention to a woman sitting at the island: Jacqueline, a 27-year-old psychology student with long dark hair, who told me that she hadn’t experienced anything as effective as Nxivm (pronounced “nexium,” like the heartburn medication). Like Scientology’s L. Ron Hubbard, whose 1950 handbook “Dianetics” was billed as the “modern science of mental health” and whose pseudoscientific methods were, in his view, world-changing, Keith Raniere, Nxivm’s 57-year-old founder, believed his organization could heal individuals and transform the world. The way Nxivm did this was through techniques, or “technology,” meant to rewire your emotional self. Salzman, who has training in neurolinguistic programming, which involves hypnosis and techniques of mirroring another individual to create deep rapport, was about to embark on a therapy session in which she would ask Jacqueline to cast her mind back to her childhood, as Nxivm sessions often do. Jacqueline had come to her with a phobia: She flips out when she gets on a plane. One time, she had to get off an airplane that had boarded because she became nervous, and when she wanted to get back on, the flight attendants wouldn’t let her. Salzman nodded. In a near whisper, she asked Jacqueline a stream of intimate questions not only about her fear of flying but also about her parents’ relationship. She ascertained that Jacqueline believed her mother was ill used by her father, who forced the family to move often, by air. “It was always gray around her,” Jacqueline said sadly, of her mother. “She had a horrible life.” But at the same time, she said, her upbringing made her feel as if she always needed a man to protect her. Listening to Salzman’s questions, it became clear that she was positing that these issues — Jacqueline’s fear of flying; her belief that her mother was forced into a terrible life by her father; and her inability to be an independent woman — were connected. We are controlling our own lives all the time, Salzman said. We are all in complete control. Jacqueline’s mom had been in control but had chosen to be a victim. And Jacqueline was in control and had chosen to be a victim, too. “Are you pretending to be a helpless woman?” Salzman said earlier. “That’s the way I receive attention, that’s kind of my thing,” Jacqueline said. “Women are allowed to be dependent on men,” Salzman explained. “A great part of being a woman is no matter how you screw up your life, you can always move back in with your dad. Every time you have chosen to stay dependent, you have made a decision not to be independent.” What if she became the person she relied on? "
131,"WASHINGTON — An American-backed ground offensive to wipe out the last pockets of Islamic State fighters in eastern Syria has been reignited over the past month in an attempt to beat back the militants’ ability to wage guerrilla attacks. The mission against the Islamic State has been invigorated by the return of top Kurdish commanders, a surge in French commandos, the arrival of Navy fighter jets and some secret sleuthing by Iraqi spies. But the campaign may have only little more than six months to hunt down the few hundred fighters — not enough time to extinguish a threat that is quickly moving underground. The new momentum remains imperiled by President Trump’s on-again, off-again threat to withdraw some 2,000 American troops in Syria, including hundreds of Special Operations advisers and commandos. A force of allied Kurds and Arabs in Syria’s east has served as the United States’ most effective battleground ally against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. But a spate of Turkish attacks last winter against other Kurds, in northwest Syria, prompted the Kurdish fighters to peel away from the American-led assault near the Iraqi border. Their absence allowed many of the remaining Islamic State militants to flee, regain scraps of territory and renew guerrilla attacks from hide-outs across the country. Trump administration officials said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and top American commanders now have been given at least six months to stamp out the Islamic State in Syria’s east. "
132,"The Wicked Witch of the West has been good to Joe Mantello. The caretaker of the green-complexioned Elphaba of Emerald City has a piece of the yellow brick road on the Great White Way. The director of the billion-dollar musical “Wicked,’’ who says he was once “desperate and unhirable,” can now afford to choose what he wants to work on. And what he has chosen has made him the hottest director on Broadway, with three shows going simultaneously, two on the same block of West 45th Street. Slender and soft-spoken, Mr. Mantello, at 55, has already won two Tonys for directing, for “Take Me Out” and “Assassins.” And he is nominated for another one at the June 10 ceremony, for helming the scorching revival of Edward Albee’s “Three Tall Women,” with Laurie Metcalf, Alison Pill and the glorious 82-year-old Glenda Jackson playing a role based on Mr. Albee’s adoptive mother, relishing what The New York Times called her “Queen Lear moment.” Also on 45th Street, at the Booth Theater, Mr. Mantello’s other revival has its official opening on Thursday: “The Boys in the Band,” Mart Crowley’s funny and devastating 1968 examination of gay shame in the era before AIDS at the dawn of Stonewall, produced by Ryan Murphy and David Stone, and starring Jim Parsons, Zachary Quinto, Matt Bomer and Andrew Rannells of “Girls” and “Book of Mormon” fame. When Mr. Murphy first proposed the revival, Mr. Mantello worried that the play, bristling with gay self-loathing and mutual annihilation, was too campy and dated. But Mr. Murphy suggested that his friend view it in Albee-esque terms, and the director heard its similarities in tone with “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” “There’s a lot of booze downed during the evening, and they play games,” Mr. Mantello says, adding that he came around to the idea that they shouldn’t “just relegate ‘Boys in the Band’ to the ash heap because it’s embarrassing. I thought we should look at what internalized oppression does. And if you aren’t terrified that this administration is going to take your rights away and you think we can’t go back there, you’re wrong.” "
133,"SYRACUSE, N.Y. — As a first-time Democratic congressional candidate, Juanita Perez Williams would seem to check off many of her party’s most prized boxes: female, person of color, military veteran and, as the runner-up in last year’s mayoral race in Syracuse, local name recognition. Those attributes have not been lost on national party leaders, who were looking for a formidable candidate to challenge the Republican incumbent, John Katko, in the 24th Congressional District in Central New York, a key battleground race. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee not only successfully wooed Ms. Perez Williams to run, it also helped her collect signatures on petitions to get on the primary ballot, and it placed her on its coveted “red to blue” list, a nationwide roster of candidates who receive fund-raising and strategic support. Her candidacy, however, has not come without controversy: Well before Ms. Perez Williams officially kicked off her campaign last month, another Democrat, Dana Balter, was already the established choice of four Democratic county committees. The June 26 primary between Ms. Balter and Ms. Perez Williams illustrates the national Democrats’ sense of urgency in devoting attention and resources to races they deem winnable. But in the case of the 24th District, the party’s priorities do not always jibe with the interests of those closer to the scene. Indeed, the leaders of the local Democratic committees issued a joint statement that accused the D.C.C.C. of failing to take “into account the work happening at the grass roots this year,” adding that they stood behind Ms. Balter and against the Washington “meddling that has hampered far too many races thus far.” "
134,"Among Trump-supporting religious believers, the long odds he overcame to win the presidency are often interpreted as a providential sign: Only God could have put Donald Trump in the White House, which means he must be there for some high and holy purpose. The trouble with this theory is that it’s way too simplistic about what kind of surprises an interventionist deity might have in mind. Such a God might, for instance, offer political success as a temptation rather than a reward — or use an unexpected presidency not to save Americans but to chastise them. We’re a long way from any final judgment on God’s purposes in the Trump era. But so far the Trump presidency has clearly been a kind of apocalypse — not (yet) in the “world-historical calamity” sense of the word, but in the original Greek meaning: an unveiling, an uncovering, an exposure of truths that had heretofore been hidden. That exposure came first for the Republican Party’s establishment, who were revealed as something uncomfortably close to liberal caricature in their mix of weakness, cynicism and power worship. It came next for the technocrats and the data nerds of the Democratic Party, who were revealed as ineffectual, clueless and self-regarding in opposing Trump’s clown-car campaign. And then it came for a range of celebrated media men, from Harvey Weinstein to Matt Lauer, who found that in the backlash against Trump’s misogyny their own sins were suddenly exposed. But the unveiling has not been confined, as Trump’s providentialist supporters might like to imagine, to institutions and individuals that have arrayed themselves against him. It has come as well for figures whose style anticipated him (Roger Ailes, Bill O’Reilly, that whole ménage) and for figures who have deliberately attached themselves to his populist revolt. The sins of Roy Moore were more exposed by the Trump era, and now likewise the racist paranoia of Roseanne Barr. And lately a similar moral exposure has come to precisely the sector of American Christianity where support for Donald Trump ran strongest — the denominational heart of conservative evangelicalism, the Southern Baptist Convention.

Here’s what you need to know: • The country’s recent political convulsions have raised fears about the future of the euro, the common currency of the European Union, drawing uncertainty far beyond its borders. By effectively blocking two populist parties from forming a government, President Sergio Mattarella may have laid the groundwork for a new election that could amount to a referendum on the euro. We answered 10 questions about the turmoil in Italy. Markets dropped sharply on Tuesday (the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 1.2 percent). That suggests investors think the risk of something calamitous happening in Europe has risen, even if it’s still unlikely. Our senior economics correspondent explains. • A new  Italian election would be horrifically bad timing for the E.U., as several members are in a state of political flux, our chief diplomatic correspondent writes. • Last week, we included a quote from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said of the suspension of U.S. tariffs against Beijing, “We’re putting the trade war on hold.” That was then. On Tuesday, the White House announced that the U.S. would move ahead with its plan to impose 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of imported Chinese goods. "

The public has two defenses against recklessness on Wall Street – regulations and the regulators themselves. Now, with the Trump administration’s rule loosening in full swing, the public can only hope that the men and women who oversee the big banks are up to their jobs. Federal regulators on Wednesday proposed a sweeping set of changes that would relax the Volcker rule, a major regulation introduced after the financial crisis of 2008 to stop taxpayer-protected banks from speculating for their own profit. The rule, which came into effect in 2015, was always going to create some headaches. Banks trade regularly to meet the demands of customers and to hedge their own risks. The Volcker rule allows that sort of trading, but regulators had to have ways of making sure a bank wasn’t speculating for its own gain under the guise of serving customers or hedging. To do that, the final rule included requirements that effectively forced banks to show that they were only doing the legitimate types of trading. Banks complained about the rule’s complexity, and regulators said it was hard to enforce. The changes proposed on Wednesday give the banks considerable new leeway. Here are three ways in which traders gain ground. • Currently, a bank’s short-term trading positions are at the outset presumed to be in violation of the rule, and banks must show that the positions were held to serve customers or hedge. The new Volcker rule presumes compliance. The balance of power will tip immediately to traders from regulators. "
137,"TOKYO — Ever since President Trump pulled out of planned talks with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, officials from both countries have been scrambling to salvage the summit meeting and keep it on track for June 12 in Singapore. A process that would normally take months is now being compressed into days, with meetings taking place between North Korean and American officials all over the world. Here is a rundown of who is meeting whom, and what they might be talking about. Kim Yong-chol, one of Kim Jong-un’s most trusted aides, arrived in New York on Wednesday for talks with Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state. The two had dinner together on Wednesday night as they worked on strengthening their personal relationship, a senior State Department official said. They face a monumental task: finding a path to denuclearization. Analysts believe that Mr. Pompeo will seek to clarify the North’s position on its nuclear program, which may have gotten muddled during Mr. Pompeo’s two visits to Pyongyang to meet with Kim Jong-un. Kim Yong-chol was also at those meetings. “The gap they have to work on between them is a road map toward denuclearization,” said Ri Pyong Hwi, an associate professor at Korea University, a pro-Pyongyang institution in Tokyo. “How they narrow the gap is the point.” "
138,"When Pusha-T raps, it’s with the air of a stern father lecturing his children, who may or may not be listening. But it doesn’t matter which — the teaching is its own end. That’s been the case since his days rapping alongside his brother, Malice, as one-half of the Clipse; together, they were responsible for some of the most ferocious and meticulous drug-dealing-demimonde rapping the genre has ever seen. But Malice has become No Malice — he’s given himself to a higher power — and Pusha-T is left to till that poisoned soil on his own. He is 41 now, and committed to the work, making canvases that look similar from far away but up close reveal a fluency in pointillist detail. On “Daytona,” his fourth solo release — at seven songs totaling 22 minutes, it’s an EP masquerading as an album — he remains rigorous, declaiming with a severe voice salted with light gravel. His topic: Ethics. A code of conduct derived from a bygone era in rap. Every time Pusha-T mentions Ghostface Killah and Raekwon, or alludes to the Lox, or name-checks Akinyele, he prizes a kind of street formalism particular to the New York (and New-York-inspired) rap of the 1990s, which has now largely been relegated to the underground. [Drake vs. Pusha-T, unpacked: Hear the Popcast.] This is his bailiwick, though, and there’s plenty of it on this strong album. On “Hard Piano,” he’s sneering, and “The Games We Play” is staggeringly good: “Caviar facials remove the toxins/This ain’t for the conscious, this is for the mud-made monsters.” On “Come Back Baby,” he traces the path from illegal business to legal, from anonymity to fame back to anonymity: Pusha-T doesn’t hurry; he’s sniper patient. On songs like “If You Know You Know,” he sometimes raps so crisply and sparsely — “A rapper turned trapper can’t morph into us/But a trapper turned rapper can morph into Puff” — that he almost feels disconnected from the song’s rhythm. His syllables have hard edges, and rarely does he let feeling get in the way, though the one exception is “Santeria,” inspired by the murder of his road manager. On this song, you can almost hear the wetness in Pusha-T’s rhymes, his typical stoicism traded for something a little short of breath. "
139,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. One of the two political parties is running a midterm campaign based largely on identity politics and President Trump — but it’s not the Democratic Party. The two most common themes in television advertisements by Republican candidates so far in the midterm election are Trump and immigration, according to a fascinating USA Today analysis. The immigration ads often mimic Trump’s harsh tone, talking about “illegals” who steal American jobs and the need for “a darn wall” along the U.S.-Mexico border. Is it possible to be in favor of a tougher immigration policy without race-baiting? Absolutely. But there is no reason to believe that “illegals” are really one of the country’s biggest problems today. A candidate who turns immigrants into a nefarious symbol of America’s ills is using them as a symbol of otherness — much as Trump did, often with blatantly racist overtones, in his presidential campaign. “Republicans have aired more than 14,000 campaign ads touting a tough Trump-style immigration platform this year,” write USA Today’s Deirdre Shesgreen and Eliza Collins. They add: “The GOP focus on immigration is particularly striking, given that it was not among the top 10 issues Republicans spent their ad dollars on at this point in the 2014 midterms. In that cycle, GOP contenders attacked President Obama, bashing the Affordable Care Act and promising to rein in government spending.” "
140,"Everyone is sure someone is going to die in Wednesday night’s series finale of “The Americans” on FX. But who? Hundreds of readers sent in predictions for the ending. Their plots ranged from the simple — an-eye-for-an-eye justice — to the fittingly byzantine. From the bloodless to the hemorrhagic. Many viewers assume, based on a tiny clip in the previews for the finale, that the Jennings family is heading north, hoping to grab Henry and escape via Canada. Readers’ thoughts, edited and excerpted, appear below. In a “Waco-type siege” in New Hampshire “Stan is seriously wounded by Elizabeth. Philip wants to surrender. Elizabeth threatens to shoot him, and Paige shoots her mother.” — John, Florida “Elizabeth and Philip will do a Thelma and Louise and commit suicide together.” — Jim, New York “As much as I would like to see Philip and Elizabeth escape, it would be too unrealistic. You can’t do that much damage and kill so many people and then get away scot free. At least one of them should die and I think it should be Elizabeth.” — J-Tee, Manitoba “Philip, Elizabeth and Paige are killed in a car accident while speeding to New Hampshire to pick up Henry. Perhaps Philip crashes the car purposefully because he fears the F.B.I. is closing in; perhaps it’s raining and he simply loses control. We will never know.” — JKerwin, Los Angeles “I think it’s going to end the same way “The Spy Who Came in From the Cold” ended, unfortunately. They’re both going to die, one of them self-sacrificially.” — Martin Snapp, Oakland, Calif. "
141,"A federal judge in Manhattan on Wednesday ordered lawyers for Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s longtime fixer, to complete within just over two weeks their review of a huge trove of documents and data that the F.B.I. seized from Mr. Cohen last month and that prosecutors are eager to use in their continuing investigation of him. The judge, Kimba M. Wood, said that if the lawyers did not meet her June 15 deadline, she would allow the government to take control of the review, which is seeking to determine whether any of the seized paperwork or electronic files should be protected under the lawyer-client privilege. A court-appointed special master has been overseeing scrutiny of the materials with Mr. Cohen’s lawyers, but Judge Wood suggested in a hearing in United States District Court that the process was moving too slowly. “It is important for the court to balance the slow, deliberate needs of those who are asserting attorney-client privilege,” Judge Wood said, “with the need for an investigation to go forward.” On Tuesday, the special master, Barbara S. Jones, reported to the judge that more than one million items from three of Mr. Cohen’s cellphones would be turned over to the government on Wednesday after lawyers for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump determined that they contained no privileged information. About 300,000 additional files were turned over to prosecutors last week. Among the items not yet cleared for release, a prosecutor said in court on Wednesday, were the contents of two BlackBerry phones and of one of Mr. Cohen’s shredders. Boxes of documents, about a dozen cellphones, iPads and computers, and 19 hard drives and thumb drives were seized on April 9 when federal agents raided Mr. Cohen’s office, apartment and hotel room. "
142,"WASHINGTON — It was not the racist comment that made the president angry. It was the apology from ABC. Wading into a public outcry over remarks by the comedian Roseanne Barr, President Trump did not condemn the Twitter post about a black former aide to President Barack Obama that led to the swift cancellation of Ms. Barr’s ABC sitcom. Instead, he expressed his own grievances on Wednesday and Thursday with what the network’s on-air personalities have said about him, and insisted he was the one who deserved an apology. Specifically, the president called out Robert A. Iger, the chairman of Disney, the parent company of ABC, who had phoned the former Obama aide, Valerie Jarrett, on Tuesday to apologize for Ms. Barr’s language. The president, referring to himself in the third person, complained on Twitter that Mr. Iger had “never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC.” His response was not a total surprise. Mr. Trump has reacted to other divisive events not by issuing statements of unity or moral clarity as other presidents might have done, but by finding equivalence or diverting attention. He declared last summer that there were “fine people” on both sides of a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Va., and when African-Americans raised the issue of police brutality last fall, he attacked the N.F.L. players who knelt during the national anthem in protest. While Mr. Trump did not specify the “horrible statements” that he attributed to the network, ABC is home to Jimmy Kimmel, the late-night host who is a notable critic of the president’s effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and “The View,” whose panel of pundits like Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg has been a reliable thorn in Mr. Trump’s side. Later in the day, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, followed up on the president’s tweet by furnishing a list of expanded gripes that members of the Trump administration have against those in the news media who have slighted the president or his supporters.

143,"STOCKTON, Calif. — This town in California’s Central Valley has long functioned as a display case for wrenching troubles afflicting American life: The housing bust that turned Stockton into an epicenter of a national foreclosure disaster and plunged the city into bankruptcy. The homeless people clustered in tents along the railroad tracks. Boarded-up storefronts on cracked sidewalks. Gang violence. Now, Stockton hopes to make itself an exhibition ground for elevated fortunes through a simple yet unorthodox experiment. It is readying plans to deliver $500 a month in donated cash to perhaps 100 local families, no strings attached. The trial could start as soon as the fall and continue for about two years. As the first American city to test so-called universal basic income, Stockton will watch what happens next. So will governments and social scientists around the world as they explore how to share the bounty of capitalism more broadly at a time of rising economic inequality. Will single mothers use their cash to pay for child care so they can attend college? Will people confronting choices between buying school supplies or paying their electric bills gain a measure of security? Will families add healthier food to their diets? Basic income is a term that gets thrown around loosely, but the gist is that the government distributes cash universally. As the logic runs, if everyone gets money — rich and poor, the employed and the jobless — it removes the stigma of traditional welfare schemes while ensuring sustenance for all. "
144,"After more than four months of spiraling political scandal, criminal charges and the threat of impeachment, Gov. Eric Greitens of Missouri made a surprise announcement: He would resign his office by the end of the week. It was a sudden switch for a governor who for months defiantly rejected a chorus of calls to quit and who said he had done nothing illegal. On Wednesday, prosecutors in St. Louis said they would dismiss a felony charge against him as part of a deal reached if he resigned. Here are five takeaways from Mr. Greitens’s saga. As he defended himself in recent months, Mr. Greitens chose his words carefully. “Let’s call this what it is,” he said at a news conference last month. “A political witch hunt.” An ad last week, paid for by the governor’s political operation, also used language that sounded borrowed from Mr. Trump. “Don’t let the liberals get away with it,” the narrator urged. “Stand with Eric Greitens.” The ad also referred to “fake news” and a “liberal prosecutor funded by George Soros.” And for months, Mr. Greitens has refused to back down from accusations swirling around him: an extramarital affair and impropriety relating to his political campaign. "
145,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that he wished he had chosen another lawyer to be his attorney general, instead of Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the Russia investigation early in the Trump administration. But Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said later that the president would not fire Mr. Sessions — at least not before the Russia inquiry has concluded. “There’s no doubt he’s complained about him; there’s no doubt he has some grievances,” Mr. Giuliani told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. “He’s not going to fire him before this is over.” He added, “Nor do I think he should,” an indication that the prospect has been discussed since he joined the president’s legal team a few weeks ago. Mr. Trump was responding on Twitter to a CBS interview with Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, who had said the president was justified in his frustration because Mr. Sessions did not tell Mr. Trump he planned to recuse himself. In the interview on Wednesday morning, Mr. Gowdy said, “There are lots of really good lawyers in the country, he could have picked somebody else!” "
146,"While living in Calgary, the headquarters of Canada’s oil and gas industry, I occasionally heard people in the business say their pipelines were cursed. The country was brimming with oil and gas, and yet battles over proposed pipelines had limited the ability of producers to get those resources to market. The story of the latest controversy, an expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, took a significant turn on Tuesday when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government announced it would nationalize it. The government’s purchase of Trans Mountain from the Houston-based energy infrastructure company Kinder Morgan for $4.5 billion in Canadian dollars underscores just how difficult it has become to build fossil fuel projects, at least in wealthy, democratic countries, long thought to pose fewer political and social risks than developing countries. The Trans Mountain project has turned this calculation on its head, mainly because of growing environmental opposition. Kinder Morgan’s chief executive, Steven Kean, seemed to foresee the sale when he said on April 18, “It’s become clear this particular investment may be untenable for a private party to undertake.” The Trans Mountain expansion will nearly triple the capacity of the existing pipeline that runs from the province of Alberta to the west coast of British Columbia. In early April, Kinder Morgan Canada suspended most work on the project, despite having spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it and receiving approvals from Canadian regulators. It cited grass-roots resistance and opposition from British Columbia’s provincial government as the primary reasons. In response, Alberta’s premier, Rachel Notley, vowed that her oil-rich province would work with Kinder Morgan “to establish a financial relationship that will eliminate investor risk.” Prime Minister Trudeau reaffirmed his government’s support for the pipeline and promised financial aid to make it happen. That ultimately led to the federal government’s decision to buy Trans Mountain and force the pipeline’s expansion. “Our government’s position is clear: It must be built and it will be built,” the finance minister, Bill Morneau, said on Tuesday.

It’s a far cry from the staid halls of the United States Capitol, where she hopes to replace a Republican congressman who once  said that California had “embarked on a rash mission to curtail global warming.” Ms. Phoenix, 36, has specialized in the study of volcanoes since a stint in 2008 at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, where she found her field work on Mauna Loa and Kilauea so exhilarating that she changed her initial plans to conduct research on subduction zones and plate tectonics. Now, she is one of several Democrats looking to challenge Representative Steve Knight in California’s 25th District in November — and one of hundreds of scientists seeking public office this year, many of them motivated by opposition to the Trump administration’s environmental policies. She has received advice and resources  from 314 Action, a nonprofit group working to elect people with expertise in science and math fields. The group, named after the first three digits of the mathematical constant pi, said it had trained 1,500 prospective candidates in the past year and a half, including around 450 who are currently running for state or federal office. Joshua Morrow, the executive director, argued that scientists would bring to the government “a common-sense approach to problem solving,” as well as an instinct for collaboration and a tendency to follow where the facts lead. “If we’re going to really address issues like climate change and technology in a meaningful way,” Mr. Morrow said, “we have to have people with that experience elected.” Ms. Phoenix’s first test will come in the California primary on June 5. The top two vote-getters, regardless of party, will advance to the general election in November. The district includes Santa Clarita, Simi Valley and Lancaster. "
148,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The June 5 primary election here in California will be the first major test of a feverish effort by Democrats to fight President Trump’s agenda. Their aim is to flip a handful of Republican-held congressional districts in the Golden State as part of their broader goal to take control of the House of Representatives in November. But in the heavily agrarian San Joaquin Valley, where several Republican members of Congress are expected to pull off easy re-elections, the mood is decidedly less feverish. Many people in the area interviewed for a recent article about the primaries expressed surprise that an election was happening; there, the primaries themselves have included few candidates and baked-in expectations about who will win. But renewed trade-related tensions with China on Tuesday put a spotlight on how quickly political tides can shift. The unpredictability of the Trump administration’s policy with China has already worried farmers across the state, many of whom voted for Mr. Trump and grow staple products like almonds and pistachios that are targeted for tariffs. In 2016, the state exported $2 billion in agriculture products to China, which is the state’s third biggest foreign market for farm goods. "
149,"Big banks are getting a big reprieve from a postcrisis rule aimed at curbing risky behavior on Wall Street. Federal bank regulators on Wednesday unveiled a sweeping proposal to soften the Volcker Rule, a cornerstone of the 2010 law that was enacted after the financial crisis to rein in risky trading. The change would give Wall Street banks more freedom to make their own complex bets — activities that can be highly profitable but also leave them more vulnerable to losses. The rule, part of the broader Dodd-Frank law, was put in place to prevent banks from making unsafe bets with depositors’ money. It took five agencies three years to write it and has been criticized by Wall Street as too onerous and harmful to the proper functioning of financial markets. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve proposed easing several parts of the rule, and four other regulators are expected to soon follow suit, kicking off a public comment period that is expected to last 60 days. The loosening of the Volcker Rule is part of a coordinated effort underway in Washington to relax rules put into place in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Big banks, emboldened by President Trump’s deregulatory agenda and a more favorable political climate in Washington, have begun pressing for changes to several postcrisis rules, including the Volcker Rule. Last week, Mr. Trump signed into law a bipartisan bill that will free thousands of small and medium-size banks from the Dodd-Frank law, and on May 21, he signed a law rescinding a consumer rule aimed at preventing discrimination by auto lenders. The Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency recently proposed easing limits on how much the largest banks can borrow and the Fed also proposed changes to the stress tests that banks must undergo each year to determine whether they can withstand an economic downturn. Mr. Trump’s acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Mick Mulvaney, has also engaged in a rapid series of regulatory changes since November, including halting new investigations, freezing new hires and preventing the agency from collecting certain data from banks.

150,"To the Editor: Re “Trump’s Magical Fantasy World” (column, May 25): David Brooks opines that we are being seduced into President Trump’s fantasy world “like puppets on his string” dominated by the “Trumpian soap opera.” He is misunderstanding, in my opinion, the reality of many Americans. As a psychoanalyst I hear many of my patients describe the feeling of living in a waking nightmare in a reality that is both terrifying and terrorizing because reality itself is under constant attack. This leads not to seduction but to hypervigilance in an effort to manage a constant feeling of threat. I have urged many of my patients to respect their need to be informed without compulsively monitoring the news in a failed effort to reassure themselves that they are safe. For many people some form of activism, an antidote to feeling paralyzed with fear and helplessness, is crucial. Many mental health experts have argued that Mr. Trump’s problem staying in reality impairs his ability to make decisions and raises questions as to his fitness to serve. We are witnessing a metaphorical train crash in slow motion. History will not be kind to those who blindly or knowingly joined our president for the ride. LARRY S. SANDBERG, NEW YORK The writer is a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical Center. "
151,"Every June, with the arrival of Pride Month, we take time to evaluate legislative actions, court decisions and public opinion shifts as measures of the state of L.G.B.T. rights. For me, an observer of politics and a numbers guy, these metrics are my stock in trade. But this year, I found perhaps the most significant indicator of the prevailing cultural vibe, to my surprise, in country music. One of the most popular songs on country radio in 2018 has been Luke Bryan’s “Most People Are Good.” The song faithfully serves up genre-typical lyrics like “I believe most mommas oughta qualify for sainthood” and “most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights” — but the chorus also contains a clear pro-L.G.B.T. declaration: “I believe you love who you love/Ain’t nothing you should ever be ashamed of.” And in case fans were tempted to interpret this lyric in other ways, Mr. Bryan’s music video features gay couples and same-gender parent family configurations among a diverse montage of “good” people. Mr. Bryan didn’t write the song — the title itself was born out of the country songwriter Josh Kear’s struggle to process the divisive 2016 presidential elections, and the song was ultimately a collaborative effort with David Frasier and Ed Hill — but he said he knew he wanted to record the song the first time he heard it. As he put it: “I think it’s a song that the songwriters wrote perfectly from A to Z; not one wasted lyric in that thing. Anytime you can find a song that does that, I think it’s something special.” Rather than generating protests or public outcry, this song has dominated country music radio since its debut in late 2017. It broke into the Top 10 in February, and it has remained at the top of the air wave charts, occupying the No. 1 slot for three weeks. It’s also notable that Mr. Bryan is no progressive crusader out to make a political statement. A Georgia native, he is as mainstream as it gets, with previous hits that include lyrics that would make many liberals cringe, such as “Country Girl (Shake It for Me)” on his album “Tailgates & Tanlines.” When asked about “Most People Are Good,” Mr. Bryan has simply replied, “It just seems like it’s the right song for people to hear with everything going on in our world today.” For Mr. Bryan, and for many country fans today, pro-L.G.B.T. lyrics exist comfortably within a new country worldview. "
152,"Americans love to eat foreign food, and hate to read foreign books. That’s the perception in publishing circles, anyway, and if there are obvious exceptions — I’m looking at you, Paulo Coelho — it’s still the case that even adventurous readers in this country aren’t always sure where to start once they reach the border. We’re here to help. Three of this week’s recommended titles are European novels: “Mirror, Shoulder, Signal,” by the Danish writer Dorthe Nors, “All for Nothing,” by the German writer Walter Kempowski, and “Kudos,” the conclusion of an exceptional trilogy by the British writer Rachel Cusk. Staying in the realm of foreign affairs, you might pick up Ronan Farrow’s “War on Peace,” about the decline of the United States diplomatic corps. And for people in this country or elsewhere who prefer to read about America and its ways, we have books (fiction and non) about Appalachia and Southern California, capitalism, criminal justice and more. Gregory Cowles
Senior Editor, Books KUDOS, by Rachel Cusk. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26.) “Kudos” is the final book in Cusk’s trilogy of small, serious, flexible and emphatic novels that began with “Outline” in 2015 and continued last year with “Transit.” The thrust of the narrative, as in each of the previous books, is talk — stories from people Faye, a British writer, meets while she travels. “As trilogies of recent vintage go, these books,” our critic Dwight Garner writes, “strike me as a stark, modern, adamantine new skyscraper on the literary horizon.” Cusk “has that ability, unique to the great performers in every art form, to hold one rapt from the moment she appears.” THE MIRAGE FACTORY: Illusion, Imagination, and the Invention of Los Angeles, by Gary Krist. (Crown, $27.) In “The Mirage Factory,” Krist marshals his considerable storytelling skills to capture Los Angeles at a critical moment: the period between 1900 and 1930, when an agricultural town of 100,000 people became a burgeoning city of 1.2 million, replete with new industries, a new identity and, crucially, newfound water. He tells that story by directing our attention to three individuals: the engineer and water czar William Mulholland, the filmmaker D.W. Griffith and the Pentecostal evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. “Krist is a nimble scene-setter, and it’s the indelible details he offers that give ‘The Mirage Factory’ its mesmerizing pull,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. “You’ll finish it entertained, informed and satisfied, as well as ready for more.” MIRROR, SHOULDER, SIGNAL, by Dorthe Nors. Translated from the Danish by Misha Hoekstra. (Graywolf, $16.) Nors, the darkly comic and wily Danish writer, is at her most unassuming and ambitious in this novel, which was a finalist for the International Man Booker Prize in 2017. It tells the story of Sonja, a single, 40-something translator of gory crime novels reeling from a breakup while living alone in Copenhagen. Nors has an intense fascination with aging, and with women who have resisted domestication. “We’re locked in Sonja’s consciousness,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes, “but the novel never becomes claustrophobic. Opening it feels like opening a window — there’s a bracing freshness and chill to the writing, and the unforced ease of a song.” CALYPSO, by David Sedaris. (Little, Brown, $28.) In his new collection of comic personal essays, Sedaris — who is now 61 — grapples seriously with themes of family, mortality and illness. As always, his very essence seeps through the pages like an intoxicating cloud. “This entrancing collection of essays, and my fascination with its author,” our reviewer, Alan Cumming, writes, “sucked me into some nerdy netherworld where real life becomes weirder and funnier and darker and bleaker than, well, real life.” ALL FOR NOTHING, by Walter Kempowski. Translated by Anthea Bell. (New York Review Books, paper, $16.95.) Until recently, the plight of the nearly 750,000 Germans who fled East Prussia in the last days of World War II remained a taboo subject in fiction. Kempowski’s novel, a work of lyrical melancholy originally published in German in 2006, conjures a privileged East Prussian family who must decide whether to join the exodus. Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim’s review calls it a “chamber motet that is finely blended,” well worth reading “as a literary response to a long-buried collective trauma.” "
153,"Mr. Trump and his aides have given a number of conflicting reasons — sometimes within hours of each other or even in the same interview — for why he fired Mr. Comey from his position as F.B.I. director on May 9, 2017. At the time, Mr. Comey was leading the investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign had coordinated with Russian election meddling. Initially, the White House cited a recommendation from Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who criticized Mr. Comey’s handling of the conclusion of a separate investigation into whether Hillary Clinton mishandled classified emails. On May 10, 2017, Mr. Trump informed Russian officials in an Oval Office meeting that he had fired Mr. Comey. “I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off,” Mr. Trump told the Russians, as The New York Times has reported. And in an NBC News interview that was broadcast on May 11, 2017, Mr. Trump said he had made up his mind to fire Mr. Comey — even before Mr. Rosenstein’s recommendation — at least partly because of the Russia investigation: However, in that same interview with the NBC News anchor Lester Holt, Mr. Trump also said Mr. Comey was fired because of his incompetence — a decision the president acknowledged could drag out the Russia investigation: A few months later, Mr. Trump again said he would have fired Mr. Comey regardless of Mr. Rosenstein’s recommendation. “Now, perhaps I would have fired Comey anyway, and it certainly didn’t hurt to have the letter, O.K. But he gives me a very strong letter, and now he’s involved in the case,” the president said in a July 2017 interview with The Times.   "
154,"To the Editor: Re “A Racist Post, a TV Apology, a Trump Gripe” (front page, May 31): The most damaging, insidious and hateful words and actions by President Trump are not the meanspirited, divisive language used against his own government employees as well as the public. Instead, they have to do with race. Bigotry is ugly, morally reprehensible, destructive. Roseanne Barr’s comments are not necessarily the problem. Such ignorance and spite will always exist as a challenge to our diversity. No, the problem is the abdication by Mr. Trump, as the purported leader of our nation, of any rejection of such hostility. “Birtherism,” Charlottesville and this latest example of the unwillingness to condemn blatant racial prejudice threaten our becoming the inclusive, just and moral society toward which we have aspired since our founding. November can’t come soon enough to send a clear message that we will not tolerate intolerance. GINO GIRARDI, DOYLESTOWN, PA. To the Editor: The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, often claims that the president is working hard for the American people every day. But that’s hard to see when he repeatedly turns every issue on its head and makes it about Donald J. Trump. PATRICIA WELLER
EMMITSBURG, MD. To the Editor: Re “ ‘Roseanne’ Self-Destructs With a Racist Tweet” (front page, May 30): I welcomed the response of ABC executives in canceling “Roseanne.” Roseanne Barr — the person — deserved the punishment received for her racist comments. Even so, “Roseanne” — the show — did provide audiences with a front-row view of a conservative America that is often ignored, sometimes in this paper. Don’t get me wrong, the show itself had its faults. But as a biracial black woman with white family members who support President Trump, I relished the few nuanced glimpses I got of a conservative family that could almost be my own — a small reminder that more, probably, connects us than Mr. Trump divides us. I’m still not certain how to deal with my family or Trump supporters in general, but they have life’s stories to tell, too. I wonder if ABC could give us a show that highlights these conservative experiences without the racism, bigotry and homophobia that Ms. Barr embodied. But one question remains: Is that even possible? LEAH GOSE, CAMBRIDGE, MASS. To the Editor: ABC has missed a major opportunity for good with the inane and racist comment tweeted by Roseanne Barr. Instead of its understandable, yet kneejerk reaction to cancel the highly rated (and profitable) show, it could have addressed the racism that lingers in our country. The talented staff of the show could have created an episode that addressed this incident head on. Archie Bunker, the bigoted and lovable character in “All in the Family,” did this all the time. Unfortunately, we live in such a hypersensitive time that more name-calling and ugly tweets will be the way we handle this, on both sides of the political spectrum. RAND MOORHEAD

155,"Today, we take pity upon the supply chain managers, the financial planners, the logisticians and procurement chiefs at every American company that uses steel and aluminum in its products. They face a difficult few months trying to adapt their businesses to new tariffs on metals imported from Canada, Mexico and the European Union, which start at midnight Thursday. Some prices are likely to rise, and some business operations may even turn out to be noneconomical in this new trade policy landscape, and shutter entirely. It’s worth keeping some perspective on the direct, immediate damage from the tariffs and likely retaliation from trading partners. Prices for inputs like steel move around all the time, and businesses are generally pretty good at adapting.  Those supply chain managers and logisticians are good at their jobs. But there’s a longer-term danger for the American economy that’s a lot bigger than the 25 percent tax on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum. It is that the administration’s trade policy is displaying an erratic, improvised, us-against-the-world quality that is anathema to businesses that must make long-term decisions about how to deploy capital. In a market economy, businesses can thrive despite bad policies. Go to any rich country, and you’ll find certain tax and regulatory policies that seem bonkers to an outsider. Japan taxes imported American beef at high rates — 50 percent until recently. Most stores in Germany have to close on Sunday. Go to Sweden or South Korea or Canada and you can find rules that impede the free market, yet businesses do just fine. That’s because those policies may be inefficient, but they are stable in their inefficiency. German stores build into their business models the expectation that there will be no Sunday sales, and a beef importer in Japan builds the tariff into its prices. "

157,"There is a word, beloved by the Kremlin and all its representatives, that has yet to cross into an American lexicon that longs for such Russian transplants: provokatsiya. Literally: a provocation. Figuratively: a false-flag operation. The poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Britain? Provokatsiya! The shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine? Provokatsiya! The Kremlin’s interference in the 2016 presidential race? Provokatsiya, obviously. Before Wednesday, it was easy to deride Kremlin cries of provokatsiya as a cynical way of directing our gaze away from the facts and past them — onto the highly improbable and the flat-out conspiratorial. But after Wednesday, thanks to the machinations of the Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko, dismissing such claims became far more difficult. This time, the Russians turned out to be right. The story is straight out of a Bond film: On Tuesday, Mr. Babchenko, who had long irked the Kremlin with his critical coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, was shot in the back three times in his apartment while his wife was in the shower. He was living in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, where he had fled because he feared for his safety in Moscow. But Russian agents found him even there, and he died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. His wife, the police said, was in a state of shock. "
158,"Dinesh D’Souza, the best-selling author and documentarian who received a presidential pardon for a felony conviction of making illegal campaign contributions, has spent almost four decades in a cycle of provocation and controversy that has made him, at times, a hero of the right. His books and movies attacking liberal ideologies and politicians have had great commercial success, but he has promoted conspiracy theories and his work has been criticized as inaccurate and excessively incendiary, sometimes by other conservatives. President Trump pardoned him on Thursday, saying that Mr. D’Souza had been “treated very unfairly by our government,” echoing a claim the commentator has often made himself. [The president is also weighing commuting the sentence of Rod Blagojevich] Here’s a look at Mr. D’Souza’s past. In 2014, Mr. D’Souza was accused of using straw donors to donate $20,000 to a Republican Senate candidate in New York, exceeding the personal limit of $5,000. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a $30,000 fine and five years of probation, including eight months living under supervision in a “community confinement center” in San Diego. Prosecutors said he enlisted two people to donate $10,000 apiece on behalf of themselves and their spouses to Wendy E. Long, a friend from Dartmouth who lost in a landslide to Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, a Democrat. He then reimbursed the donors in cash. "
159,"The world of illegal abortion today looks nothing like the way it did 45 years ago. When I first visited Chile, in 2008, it was one of a handful of countries in the world that banned abortion in all cases, without exception. Given that hundreds of women a year died from botched illegal abortions in the United States before Roe v. Wade, which legalized the procedure in 1973, I expected to find hospitals in Chile overflowing with dying women. Instead, I found that abortion drugs have dramatically altered the situation. I’ve spent the past decade studying abortions in Latin American countries where abortion is always, or almost always, illegal. Yet, abortion in these countries remains commonplace. It is vastly safer than it was in the past, thanks to a revolution that has replaced back alleys with blister packs ordered online. But this revolution has come with unexpected consequences — for the doctor-patient relationship and for law enforcement. Whether we’re marching with coat-hanger posters or passing laws that outlaw the procedure earlier and earlier, we fight over abortion in the United States as if we know what will happen if it’s banned. But as we inch closer to potentially allowing states to recriminalize the procedure — with laws that ban abortions after six weeks, as in Iowa, and even seek to effectively ban the use of abortion-inducing drugs — we would do well to look past our southern border to consider what happens when abortion actually is illegal. It’s not the outcome anyone is looking for. Abortifacient drugs have become so readily available in places like Chile and El Salvador that it has become impossible to enforce abortion bans. That was also the case in Ireland, where by some accounts, before last month’s legalization vote, at least two Irish women a day were self-administering abortions using pills. The most widely available abortion drug in Latin America, misoprostol, is commonly used to treat ulcers. Although less effective than the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol used in the United States, misoprostol taken in the first trimester causes an abortion in approximately 90 percent of cases. In Brazil, where abortion is all but banned, experts estimate there are about a million illegal abortions each year; around half of them are induced using abortion drugs. Efforts to restrict access to misoprostol will fail not simply because it costs pennies to make, but also because it saves lives. The World Health Organization lists misoprostol as an “essential medicine” for treating miscarriages, and the drug has been credited with reducing deaths from illegal abortions. But if abortion drugs have reduced the risk of death from illegal abortion, they have also generated new concerns: When abortion is a crime, the emergency room can become the scene of a criminal investigation, and doctors the detectives. "
160,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration took a major step toward dramatically weakening an Obama-era rule designed to cut pollution from vehicle tailpipes, setting the stage for a legal clash with California that could potentially split the nation’s auto market in two. The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday submitted its proposal to roll back climate change rules that required automakers to nearly double the fuel economy of passenger vehicles to an average of more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025. The rules, which would have significantly lowered the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions, were opposed by automakers who said they were overly burdensome. However, the proposed Trump rule could lead to unintended and unwanted consequences for those same car companies. The Obama-era regulations would have forced automakers to make and sell far more electric and hybrid vehicles, but the new proposal could end up leading to two separate sets of fuel economy regulations within the United States, creating what automakers say would be an even greater regulatory burden. Jahan Wilcox, a spokesman for the E.P.A., confirmed on Thursday that the agency had sent its proposed regulatory rollback to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review. Typically that is the final step before a proposed rule is published in the Federal Register. The rules are then open for public comment before taking effect, during which the terms could still be modified. While the administration had been expected to take the steps laid out on Thursday, the proposal is significant because it amounts to an official declaration of its intent. Together with President Trump’s plans to undo a separate set of climate change regulations, on pollution from coal-fired power plants, “this represents the centerpiece of the administration’s gutting of the Obama-era domestic climate portfolio,” said Robert N. Stavins, a professor of environmental economics at Harvard University. "
161,"Six pages into SABRINA (Drawn and Quarterly, $27.95), Nick Drnaso’s new graphic novel, the title character’s sister reads out a clue from the crossword puzzle she’s working on. “Twelve letters,” she says. “We killed the Clutter family.” Sabrina knows the answer: “Dick and Perry” — the killers made famous by Truman Capote’s “In Cold Blood.” On first read, it’s just an example of the conversational vérité that Drnaso excels at, the brief reunion between the two adult siblings at their mom’s house in Chicago. Four pages later, Sabrina heads out the door, the last time we see her alive. Not yet 30, Drnaso has topped his virtuoso 2016 debut, “Beverly,” which had a cheerful palette gleefully at odds with all that roiled beneath its speckless Midwestern skies: class friction and psychosexual urges, brain-draining sitcoms and kneejerk racism. (Nearly everyone in Drnasoland is white.) Some of the visual shocks in “Beverly” lodge in the head, like certain demonic glimpses from “The Shining” — but “Sabrina” goes deeper, risks more. It’s an unnerving mystery told by a rigorous moralist, a profoundly American nightmare set squarely in the first year of the Trump presidency. Politics is never mentioned, but the dread is everywhere: on the airwaves, at an open mic, in a kid’s activity book, and — most barbarically — online. The book centers on the uneasy bond between Calvin Wrobel, who works at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado, and Teddy, Sabrina’s boyfriend of two years. Newly divorced, Calvin is unusually empathetic and selfless; he takes in Teddy, who arrives from Illinois completely numb after Sabrina’s disappearance. Out of touch since high school, Calvin nevertheless cares for his helpless charge, bringing him fast food and giving him the run of his comfortable, desolate house. At work, dressed in fatigues, Calvin periodically fills out Department of Defense mental health surveys, registering hours slept, drinks consumed and whether he’s entertained thoughts of suicide. He always answers in the negative. Then a videotape surfaces at a news outlet, with sickening confirmation of Sabrina’s fate. Naturally, the murderer’s name starts trending. An investigator tells Calvin they’re “desperately trying to keep this video from leaking onto the internet,” but its migration is inevitable. (“I need to see this,” one commenter writes.) In an unguarded moment, the upright Calvin hits download, but Drnaso doesn’t show what he sees, leaving the worst of it to the reader’s imagination. Teddy’s rage at the senseless loss and the virtual violation makes him vulnerable, unpredictably, to another obscenity: a false-flag narrative peddled by an “Infowars”-like show, relentlessly flowing from a radio as he clutches a pillow. “I have been targeted for voicing what amounts to perfectly legal and acceptable free speech,” the host insists. “If you ever see me being taken away in handcuffs, you’ll know what’s going on.” After conspiracy theorists, emboldened online, notice that the victim’s last boyfriend is cohabiting with a member of the military, Calvin gets threats from people who believe he’s an actor. "
162,"To the Editor: In “The Donald of Silicon Valley” (column, May 26), about Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Motors, Bret Stephens somehow misses the whole point of electric cars: They are much cleaner than gasoline-powered cars. Carbon dioxide pollution from transportation is now the largest contributor to global warming in the United States, and electric cars are responsible for less than half the emissions of the average new gasoline car, according to detailed life cycle studies by the Union of Concerned Scientists and others. Electric cars and trucks are therefore an indispensable tool worldwide to prevent runaway climate change. Mr. Stephens compares Mr. Musk to President Trump, but to Mr. Musk’s credit, and unlike the president, Mr. Musk understands the dangers we face from global warming and is addressing the problem head on by building cars exciting enough to lure us away from the gasoline engine. Mr. Stephens rightly notes that some Tesla models are too expensive for the average family. But now that Mr. Musk has popularized the idea of electric vehicles, many automakers are jumping in and building excellent, affordable cars that drive well over 200 miles on a charge and can save the average driver about $800 a year in fuel costs. I should know; I own one. KEN KIMMELL, CAMBRIDGE, MASS. The writer is president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. To the Editor: I was surprised to see Bret Stephens so fervently miss the point behind Elon Musk’s cult status. It is, of course, that dreamers and their passions inspire all of us. America once encouraged people like Mr. Musk, but today’s risk takers are few and far between. Despite Mr. Stephens’s assessment, Tesla makes really fine automobiles, and Space X is a pretty good rocket company. We need more people like Mr. Musk. They don’t need to be perfect, because we all benefit when they just dream big and try. ROBERT MIX, SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. "
163,"WASHINGTON — The top Republican on the Senate Education Committee effectively killed on Thursday all hope for a highly anticipated overhaul this year of the law governing the nation’s 4,000 colleges and universities, paving the way for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to wield her deregulatory power. The committee chairman, Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, said at a New York Times education conference in New York that the Senate would not produce promised higher education legislation this year, and blamed Democrats for the delay. “The Democrats won’t do it,” he said, adding, “They want to wait until next year to see if they’re in better shape politically, but I keep telling them, ‘I can take notes and do to you what you did to me, even if I’m in the minority.’” Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the committee’s ranking Democrat, has said repeatedly that her party is not the problem. Ms. Murray, a spokeswoman said, “has made it clear that she wants to reauthorize the Higher Education Act as soon as possible to address the rising costs of college, increase access to underrepresented students, hold schools accountable for student success, and ensure every student is safe and free from discrimination on campus.” "
164,"Samantha Bee apologized on Thursday for having used a vulgar epithet to describe Ivanka Trump on her TBS show, saying she had “crossed a line.” TBS also issued an apology, but took no disciplinary action against the late night host. Ms. Bee’s insult of the president’s elder daughter on Wednesday’s episode of “Full Frontal With Samantha Bee” included a crude reference for the female anatomy — and caused a furor made more intense because the remark came just a day after ABC swiftly canceled “Roseanne” over a racist tweet by the show’s star, Roseanne Barr. The different consequences for the two politically minded entertainers — Ms. Barr is an outspoken supporter of the president, while Ms. Bee is a full-throated opponent of the Trump administration — provided conservatives with a fresh opportunity to accuse the media industry of having a liberal bias. Hours before Ms. Bee and the cable network issued their apologies, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, called the host’s remarks “vile and vicious.” “The collective silence by the left and its media allies is appalling,” Ms. Sanders said. “Her disgusting comments and show are not fit for broadcast, and executives at Time Warner and TBS must demonstrate that such explicit profanity about female members of this administration will not be condoned on its network.” Friday morning, it became clear that Ms. Bee’s apology was not good enough for President Trump. He asked in a tweet why TBS has not fired “no talent Samantha Bee.” "
165,"ROME — After 88 days of impasses and negotiations, two Italian populist parties with a history of antagonism toward the European Union received approval Thursday night to create a government that has already unsettled the Continent’s political order. Only days ago, President Sergio Mattarella of Italy rejected a populist government over concerns about a proposed finance minister who had helped write a guide for withdrawing Italy from the euro, Europe’s single currency. The political chaos and sudden uncertainty about the euro helped send global financial markets reeling. On Thursday, the populists reshuffled, keeping the same prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and other top players, but moving the objectionable finance minister to a less critical post. That was apparently enough to satisfy the president, who preferred an elected government to a caretaker alternative he had in reserve. The populist parties constituting the new government won the most votes in a March 4 election, promising a sweeping crackdown on the illegal immigration that helped fuel their ascent. But the president’s assent was not enough to allay concerns about the actual agenda of the populists once they enter power, even though they now claim a sudden conversion to full faith in the euro. “The populist and right-wing government has a program that’s dangerous for the country and the events of recent days confirm our longstanding concerns,” said Maurizio Martina, a leader of the Democratic Party, which will now leave government for the opposition. “Their acts so far have been a mix of extremism, anti-Europism and iniquity.” "

168,"CHICAGO — Rod R. Blagojevich, whose criminal sentence President Trump has said he may commute, became a household name when he was arrested 10 years ago on an explosive accusation: Prosecutors said he had tried to sell or trade to the highest bidder the Senate seat that Barack Obama was vacating to become the president. Mr. Blagojevich’s expletive-filled remarks about his role in choosing a new senator — caught on government recordings of phone calls — became punch lines for late-night television. “I’ve got this thing, and it’s golden,” he was memorably quoted as saying, using profanities. “And I’m just not giving it up for nothing. I’m not going to do it. And I can always use it. I can parachute me there.” In the years since, Mr. Blagojevich’s name has faded some. (So, court appearances show, has his trademark pouf of black hair.) Mr. Blagojevich, a Democrat, was not only the former governor of Illinois and a former member of Congress, but also an undeniably flamboyant character. He was an Elvis Presley fan who was also known for eloquent recitations of anecdotes from leaders he admired, like Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan; a figure who protested his innocence at every chance, including on reality television and radio shows and in a book he wrote; and an isolated governor who was said to keep a hairbrush nearby at all times. About a month after Mr. Obama was elected president in 2008, Mr. Blagojevich, the sitting governor of Illinois, was arrested early one morning at his Chicago home. The accusations were stunning: Prosecutors said Mr. Blagojevich (pronounced bluh-GOY-uh-vich, though plenty of people, even in Illinois, still just call him “Blago”) had not only tried to crassly benefit from making an appointment to Mr. Obama’s vacant Senate seat, but also sought millions of dollars from people who had state business in all sorts of other scenarios. Federal prosecutors said the conduct was so abysmal that it “would make Lincoln roll over in his grave.” "
169,"BEIJING — Forget Google versus Facebook. Forget Uber versus Lyft. Forget Amazon versus … well, everybody. The technology world’s most bruising battle for supremacy is taking place in China. And it could point to Big Tech’s future everywhere else, too. Tencent Holdings and the Alibaba Group are ratcheting up their no-holds-barred contest to dominate the ways 770 million internet users communicate, shop, get around, entertain themselves and even invest their savings and visit the doctor. The two titans long ago branched out from their core businesses — games and social media for Tencent, e-commerce for Alibaba — to duke it out in ever more realms of Chinese life. They have competed in messaging, microblogging and delivering takeout. They go head-to-head in video streaming and cloud computing. Today, their fiercest fight is over digital money kept on smartphones. Mobile payments have transformed the Chinese economy. Both giants, plus Ant Financial, an Alibaba sister firm, are spending big to gobble up pieces of the action. China’s internet powerhouses stand at the forefront of the nation’s galloping high-tech progress — a surge that has been brought into sharp focus by the Trump administration’s efforts to counter it. On one hand, the standoff over the Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE has exposed, to many in China, the degree to which the country still lags in core technologies such as microchips. "
170,"On Wednesday, Illinois became the 37th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. You probably have questions. Technically, yes. Congress, which overwhelmingly approved the Equal Rights Amendment on March 22, 1972, set a seven-year deadline for three-quarters of the states to ratify it. The deadline was later extended to 1982 but that deadline passed with only 35 states on board. They needed 38. More about that in a moment. But first … The proposed amendment has three sections but the first is the main clause: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.” In 1972, supporters believed the amendment would invalidate widespread discrimination, including laws that restricted a woman’s right to buy or sell property and employers’ policies that denied unemployment compensation to pregnant workers. It started with Alice Paul, a pioneering women’s rights activist in the United States who relentlessly fought for equal rights and helped lead the battle for women’s suffrage. She was even forcibly fed in jail after she went on a hunger strike. "
171,"SHANGHAI — China announced Thursday evening that it would cut tariffs sharply on July 1 for an eclectic array of imported goods, the latest in a series of moves by Beijing to dismantle steep trade barriers at a time of rising frictions with the United States. The tariff cuts came less than two days before Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is due in Beijing for wide-ranging talks aimed at addressing American frustrations with China’s $375 billion bilateral trade surplus with the United States. But the categories the Chinese Finance Ministry selected for tariff cuts cover few American goods, and appeared to be targeted at China’s goal of developing sophisticated industries rather than low-value mass manufacturing. The moves came as China and the United States, the world’s two biggest economies, continued their wide-ranging economic and diplomatic sparring. The countries have alternated between attacking each other over trade issues and working together on efforts to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons. At times, President Trump has praised his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at other times he has swiftly criticized Beijing for its trade practices, sometimes in quick succession. In its latest action, China is making a modest peace offering, without really giving up much. Some of the 1,449 categories of goods slated for tariff cuts involve food products from other countries, like fish, olives and grilled seaweed. Other categories include low-value manufactured goods like handbags and certain inexpensive garments, typically made in factories that have already been shifting from China to lower-wage competitors like Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India and Vietnam. Chinese workers’ wages have soared over the past 15 years, and Beijing is engaged in a broad effort to steer the economy toward high-wage industries like semiconductors and away from factories making garments and handbags. “The goods seeing cuts are not relevant to trade with the U.S.,” said Derek Scissors, a trade specialist at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank. “For China, it fits the goal of moving up the value chain — heavy subsidies for semiconductors and now less protection for textiles and consumer appliances.” "
172,"The European Court of Human Rights censured Lithuania and Romania on Thursday for their complicity in the C.I.A.’s torture program, saying the two European nations had hosted secret prisons where the C.I.A. held and interrogated terrorism suspects after the Sept. 11 attacks. The twin rulings by the court in Strasbourg, France, centered on two men — Abu Zubaydah, a stateless man of Palestinian heritage, and Abd al-Rahim Husseyn Muhammad al-Nashiri, a Saudi citizen of Yemeni descent — who since 2006 have been held at the American military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Using similar language, the court rejected Lithuania’s and Romania’s arguments that insufficient evidence existed to prove that the two detainees had been held on their soil or that their governments knew about the matter. The authorities in each country, the court ruled, “knew of the nature and purposes of the C.I.A.’s activities on its territory” at the time; assisted by agreeing to host prisons and helping with rendition flights to transport detainees; and knew that “by enabling the C.I.A. to detain terrorist suspects on its territory, it was exposing them to a serious risk of treatment contrary to” the European Convention on Human Rights. The court ordered Lithuania to pay Abu Zubaydah, also known as Zayn al-Abidin Muhammad Husayn, about $152,000 in damages and costs. It also ordered Romania to pay about $118,000 to Mr. Nashiri. But it is not clear whether or how those funds will be paid; the same court delivered a similar ruling against Poland on behalf of the two men in 2015, but a lawyer for Abu Zubaydah said on Thursday that Poland had not paid the roughly $262,000 in court-ordered reparations from that ruling. The cases shed light on the murky and once-hidden world of the C.I.A.’s rendition, detention and interrogation program. The agency shuttled captives suspected of major terrorist acts between secret overseas prisons called black sites and tortured them with tactics like waterboarding, prolonged sleep deprivation, forced nudity, confinement in cramped boxes and shackling into painful stress positions. "
173,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said on Thursday that it would impose steep tariffs on metals imported from its closest allies, provoking retaliation against American businesses and consumers and further straining diplomatic ties tested by the president’s combative approach. The European Union, Canada and Mexico, which will face 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, quickly denounced the action and drew up lists of tit-for-tat measures, many aimed at parts of the United States where President Trump enjoys his strongest political support. The move follows months of uncertainty as the Trump administration dangled potential exemptions for allies in return for concessions on other fronts. In moving forward with tariffs on national security grounds, the administration now faces a crucial test of whether its aggressive strategy will extract promises from trading partners or end up backfiring on the United States economy. The tariffs “have already had major, positive effects on steel and aluminum workers and jobs and will continue to do so long into the future,” White House officials said in a statement. “At the same time, the Trump administration’s actions underscore its commitment to good-faith negotiations with our allies to enhance our national security while supporting American workers.” By keeping trading partners guessing, the president has sought to create leverage in trade negotiations, including in talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. But in the process, he has sowed an atmosphere of chaos among allies as well as manufacturers uncertain about the ultimate impact on their vast supply chains. The latest twist in the trade drama does little to alleviate the confusion among business owners and foreign leaders. Although the Trump administration signaled a tougher stance with the tariffs, it also left open the possibility for continued negotiations with affected countries. "

And now, the Cavaliers and the Warriors will play each other in the finals for the fourth straight year — something that has never happened in any North American sports league. LeBron James will try to even the number of championships over that span at two apiece — but he’ll need help from an underwhelming and injured supporting cast that was brutally mocked by “Saturday Night Live.” The Warriors looked vulnerable against the Rockets, but hope to enter the conversation to be considered one of the best teams ever.

Chazz Palminteri made his Broadway musical debut this month as the gangster Sonny in the surprisingly durable show “A Bronx Tale.” He probably didn’t have to do too much character work, though: He wrote “A Bronx Tale” in 1989 as an autobiographical one-man show, and then played Sonny in this 1993 film, also starring Mr. De Niro. “Mr. Palminteri gives the kind of coolly magnetic performance that makes it easy to see why Mr. De Niro gravitated toward this material in the first place,” Janet Maslin wrote in her review in The New York Times. “And Mr. De Niro is able to lend toughness to an ending that risks becoming overpoweringly sentimental, and instead succeeds in conveying a strong sense of father-son love.” "
175,"The price of oil was in free fall and a youthful population restive. So the government of Saudi Arabia turned in recent years to the parent company of the political data firm Cambridge Analytica for help, according to Western consultants who worked in the kingdom, company executives and a review of public documents. The work by Cambridge’s parent, a secretive defense and intelligence contractor called SCL Group, presaged the tumultuous changes that are reshaping the kingdom. The company, now mired in scandals related to its corporate practices and the use of Facebook user data, conducted a detailed population study. It provided a psychological road map of the kingdom’s citizenry and its sentiment toward the royal family, even testing potential reform steps as they charted a path forward to preserve stability. The consultants and executives spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were bound by nondisclosure agreements. One proposal tested by the company was lifting a 35-year ban on cinemas in the kingdom, an action that was subsequently taken in December. Another was allowing women to drive, a move that was made last September. Under King Salman, who came to power in January 2015, the Saudis have turned to an array of consultants as crashing oil prices laid bare the kingdom’s lack of economic diversification. Some consultants, such as McKinsey & Company and the Boston Consulting Group, carried blue chip pedigrees, while SCL, founded in 1993 as Strategic Communication Laboratories, was known for its clandestine work. The company has recently burst into the public eye amid revelations that it employed seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections. And its Cambridge Analytica unit, which worked for President Trump’s campaign, collapsed amid allegations of misusing Facebook data. At least one Cambridge Analytica employee worked on the parent company’s Saudi project, according to the employee’s profile on LinkedIn. "

s soon as I made eye contact with the smiling woman in the Doctors Without Borders T-shirt on a busy Sydney street, I knew I’d be asked for money or a signature. And I knew I’d say no. “I’m a foreign correspondent for The New York Times,” I told her. “I can’t really help because at some point, somewhere, there’s a good chance I may cover what you do.” I always feel bad trying to explain journalistic detachment in such moments, and I often get looks of confusion in response. Young people in particular tend to question the limits that many of us at The Times take for granted: no marching for a cause, no advocacy and no giving or accepting of travel or gifts when dealing with sources or organizations that have an interest in news coverage. We are expected, in short, to avoid the “appearance of bias” and maintain a sense of healthy detachment from what we cover. "
177,"TAIPEI, Taiwan — On June 12, in a leafy, middle-class neighborhood in Taiwan’s capital, Taipei, the unofficial, Cold War-era relationship between this island and the United States is getting a major upgrade. That is when the American Institute in Taiwan, the United States’ embassy here in all but name, will hold a ceremony to formally unveil a $250 million office complex that resembles a university research center, just with guarded gates and blast walls. Built into a lush hillside, it will be a visible boost to American ties with Taiwan at a time when the number of official foreign diplomatic missions here continues to dwindle. The sprawling new facility, which sits on a 16-acre site, will give far more visibility, and aesthetic appeal, to the understated American diplomatic presence here, which is currently spread across multiple offices in Taipei. Its main office is a small, drab 1950s-era former military building hidden behind 10-foot walls. The institute, which is commonly known by its English acronym, A.I.T., is getting a face-lift at a moment when the relationship between Washington and Taipei — long kept low-key to avoid angering Beijing — has been elevated to levels not seen in decades. That is due in part to the administration of President Trump, who took a congratulatory phone call from Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, after he was elected, and has since given prominent jobs to people known here as “friends of Taiwan,” including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser. In March, Mr. Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act, which allows more high-level visits between Taiwan and the United States. There has been speculation here that Mr. Bolton may come, which would make him one of the highest-ranking American officials to visit Taiwan since the United States withdrew diplomatic recognition in 1979. "
178,"Over the weekend, you may have seen a horrifying story: Almost 1,500 migrant children were missing, and feared to be in the hands of human traffickers. The Trump administration lost track of the children, the story went, after separating them from their parents at the border. The news spread across liberal social media — with the hashtag #Wherearethechildren trending on Twitter — as people demanded immediate action. But it wasn’t true, or at least not the way that many thought. The narrative had combined parts of two real events and wound up with a horror story that was at least partly a myth. The fact that so many Americans readily believed this myth offers a lesson in how partisan polarization colors people’s views on a gut emotional level without many even realizing it. As other articles have explained, the missing children and the Trump administration’s separation of families who are apprehended at the border are two different matters. The Trump administration does in fact have a new policy of prosecuting all undocumented border crossers, which involves separating parents from their children. But the 1,475 children whom the Department of Health and Human Services recently reported it cannot locate are not among those taken from their parents. These “missing” children had actually come to the United States without their parents, been picked up by the Border Patrol and then released to the custody of a parent or guardian. "
179,"After shutting down schools and shaking up politics in six states, teachers are looking to the ballot box in their campaign for better pay and increased school funding. And their demands are meeting with widespread public support. A survey conducted in early May for The New York Times by the online polling firm SurveyMonkey found that nearly three in four adults — 71 percent — considered teacher pay too low, while just 6 percent felt it was too high. And two-thirds said they supported increasing the salaries of public-school teachers even if it meant raising taxes. Backing for teachers cut across demographic, regional and partisan lines. Even a majority of Republicans — 56 percent — said they would favor raising taxes to increase teachers’ pay. Recent surveys from NPR and The Associated Press produced similar findings. The teacher walkouts began in deep-red states such as West Virginia and Oklahoma, where teacher pay has tended to be lower than in other states, and spread quickly to Kentucky, Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina, racking up a list of concessions from conservative lawmakers. The movement has the potential to influence congressional, gubernatorial and state legislative races, and could catch fire in additional states when the new school year begins. The issue was prominent in recent weeks in a competitive Republican primary in the Idaho governor’s race; the winner, Lt. Gov. Brad Little, pledged to increase education funding and was endorsed by the Idaho Education Association, an affiliate of the national teachers’ union. And it resonated with Idaho residents like Rondell Nebeker, a self-described conservative Republican who said he believes in limited government and supports President Trump. Idaho has some of the lowest teacher pay and per-student education funding in the country, according to federal data, and Mr. Nebeker, 61, said he worried that the state was losing educators as a result.

As it happens, Mr. Spinella is again tackling the furious, fantastical poetry of Tony Kushner’s two-part, seven-hour play, this time as the bilious lawyer Roy Cohn at Berkeley Repertory Theater. The New York Times asked the actors, who have never met, to correspond by email during a week’s worth of shows. They wrote before, after and sometimes in between performances of “Millennium Approaches” and “Perestroika.” Below are edited excerpts from their exchange, which included insights on how to understand the character of Prior, a man with AIDS who accompanies an angel to heaven, and how to maintain the stamina to play him. Good morning, Andrew, so nice to meet you! Three hours behind you here in Berkeley and just up after a two-show day yesterday, legs still covered with alcohol-based makeup, feeling like I was hit by a truck. Two more shows today. We’ve been doing five-show weekends for five weeks now. Brutal. Four-and-a-half to five hours for each show, with prep, makes a 25-hour weekend toiling in the theater. Another two shows and it’s the French workweek! "
181,"BOSTON — On commencement day at Northern Michigan University, some students protested the speaker, Gov. Rick Snyder, and his handling of the water crisis in Flint. While some students outside the event carried signs against him, students inside the hall simply — and silently — turned their backs on him as he spoke. Protests at college commencements are almost a rite of spring, and this graduation season is no different. Some of the demonstrations this year have shapeshifted into actions more subdued than those of just a few years ago. Some are small events within larger ceremonies. And silence as a protest tactic is being used to make a point without ruffling too many feathers. At Northern Michigan, the university’s president, Fritz Erickson, appeared pleased with the outcome. In a statement, he said he appreciated that the governor, a Republican, still came, despite advance word that he would be met by protests. He said he was proud that the students had been respectful. At Tufts University, about 150 students — of 3,700 graduates — silently protested their speaker, turning their backs on Ellen Kullman, the former chief executive of DuPont. Grim-faced, they also held paper signs that chastised the chemical company’s environmental record, saying it had “dumped carcinogenic chemicals into people’s water supplies repeatedly.” And at Howard University, the commencement speaker, Chadwick Boseman, star of “Black Panther,” lauded students who had taken over the administration building earlier in the year over grievances. Mr. Boseman also praised the administration for its willingness to make changes. "
182,"WASHINGTON — Senator Bernie Sanders seemed nervous. In just two hours, he would conduct a live-streamed town hall event on the Iran nuclear deal, and he still hadn’t nailed his opening. “Did you mention to somebody doing a history of U.S.-Iranian relations?” he asked aides who had gathered in his Senate office to help him prepare. “What do you think about starting with that?” Then he wanted to say something about Saudi Arabia. Then Israel. In another room, staff members rushed to finalize last-minute details. “We convert into a small production company,” one aide joked. The town hall meeting in mid-May came off seamlessly, before a modest live audience at the Capitol Visitor Center. Mr. Sanders scripted the evening’s event, interviewed panelists and directed the conversation. There were no nettlesome questions from television or newspaper reporters. And over the next two weeks the real target audience — online viewers — would show up in droves, with some 800,000 people watching it. The event provided a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the grass-roots efforts Mr. Sanders has become known for, as his team revved up its campaign engine: A week later, Mr. Sanders would announce his bid for re-election to the Senate. The democratic socialist from Vermont is also widely believed to be considering another run for president in 2020. But the Iran discussion also reflected the kind of direct-to-voter messaging strategy that has become increasingly common among politicians — both as a way to shape information about their goals and to avoid difficult questions from the news media, particularly in the midst of scandal or controversy. From Washington to Texas to California, politicians are road-testing their political messaging strategies, searching for the best way to reach voters in ways that often bypass the traditional media gatekeepers. "
183,"WASHINGTON — For more than a year, President Trump has struggled to control the United States’ law enforcement apparatus, frustrated that it remains at least partly out of his grasp. But he is increasingly turning to a tool that allows him to push back against a justice system he calls unfair. In a burst of action and words, Mr. Trump demonstrated Thursday that, in some instances, he still has the last word. He pardoned Dinesh D’Souza, a conservative commentator convicted of campaign finance violations, and he said he may extend clemency to former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois and Martha Stewart, the lifestyle mogul. As he has for all of his acts of clemency since taking office, Mr. Trump bypassed the traditional system for granting pardons and disregarded more than 10,000 languishing applications to focus instead on prominent public figures whose cases resonated with him given his own grievances with investigators. Some critics said he may even be signaling associates — like one of his personal lawyers, Michael D. Cohen, who is under investigation for possibly violating federal campaign finance laws — to stay strong and not help prosecutors. The pardon for Mr. D’Souza, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to making illegal campaign contributions, was a victory for one of the president’s most vocal bases of support, the conservative news media. Mr. D’Souza has argued that he was singled out for prosecution by President Barack Obama’s administration because of his conservative politics, an argument that mirrors Mr. Trump’s assertions that his predecessor targeted him, too. Mr. Trump attributed his decision to absolve Mr. D’Souza and his interest in the other two cases to indignation over selective or excessive justice. Mr. D’Souza, he said, “was very unfairly treated.” He described the 14-year sentence imposed on Mr. Blagojevich, a Democrat convicted on corruption charges, as “really unfair.” He said Ms. Stewart, who spent five months in prison for lying to investigators in a stock case, “was harshly and unfairly treated.” The president’s intervention in those cases came as he rails against Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Justice Department and the F.B.I. over various investigations into his campaign, his personal lawyer and his own actions that may have been aimed at obstructing the inquiry of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. Last week, he effectively ordered the Justice Department to investigate his investigators and reveal confidential information about the case to Republican allies in Congress. "

The measure could provoke retaliation against American businesses. • Separately, federal regulators have proposed softening the so-called Volcker Rule, which was imposed after the global financial crisis and intended to prevent banks from making risky bets with depositors’ money. They said it was too complicated to enforce. • In the social media age, every minute in corporate crisis management counts. The praise the network received after swiftly axing its hit sitcom over a racist tweet could inspire other businesses facing public relations disasters. Our reporter spoke with communications experts about some of the lessons. We also looked at the pressures facing the writers and other staff members on “Roseanne.” Although they were heartened by the show’s success, Roseanne Barr’s often divisive posts on Twitter were a growing distraction. “She would tweet stuff, then apologize and get off Twitter, and then it would get better,” an executive producer said. “And then it would blow up again.” • President Trump addressed the dispute on Wednesday, saying that he, too, deserved an apology from ABC. The network had apologized to Valerie Jarrett, the subject of the tweet that got Ms. Barr’s show canceled. • The shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado nearly 20 years ago has inspired young gunmen across America, according to researchers. "
185,"Democratic voters, especially young, white liberals, have been moving sharply in a progressive direction, not only on issues of race, but across the board — on the economy, on immigration and on the environment. Zach Goldberg, a doctoral candidate in political science at Georgia State University, has been tracking ideological trends among liberal, moderate and conservative whites, using survey data collected by American National Election Studies. The accompanying chart measures support for higher immigration levels from 1992 to 2016. White moderates and conservatives, including Republicans and independents, showed relatively little change over those 24 years. Among white liberals, though, support for increased immigration grew from a low of 4 percent in 1996 to 38 percent in 2016. Goldberg broke down the data by age groups and found that the driving force was young, white liberals aged 18 to 24. In an email, Goldberg wrote: In other words, he continued, In further support of his argument, Goldberg produced the following graphic from ANES surveys: In our email exchange, Goldberg argued that Trump’s election produced what he calls “moral panic” among liberals: The Pew Research Center has documented some of the most striking shifts in a liberal direction among Democratic voters. For an October 2017 report, Pew asked respondents to choose between two statements: First, “immigrants strengthen the country because of their hard work and talents,” and second, “immigrants burden the country by taking jobs, housing and health care.” "
186,"If you’ve been on the internet in the past few days, it was impossible to avoid the articles and social media posts assailing the Trump administration for failing to keep track of 1,500 immigrant children who arrived at the United States border alone. Many well-intentioned people flooded the web with their outrage: How could the Trump administration release these children so quickly that it’s losing track of them? In fact, the problem is just the opposite. The administration is not releasing them fast enough. What has happened is that many people have confused the 1,500 children whom the government has not kept track of with children cruelly separated from their families at the border — a definite but different problem. That mistake and the resulting calls for greater control and surveillance of immigrant children could unwittingly fuel the president’s true agenda: to repeal crucial legal protections for children in immigration custody, to slow their release and to deport thousands of children who have come seeking refuge from violence and persecution. A bit of background: The agency responsible for housing immigrant children and reuniting them with sponsors is the Office of Refugee Resettlement. A nationwide consent decree signed in 1997 and a law passed by Congress in 2008 both accord children in O.R.R. custody special legal protections, including the right to be promptly released and to be placed with a safe adult sponsor. The Trump administration has made no secret of its desire to repeal both protections. Two weeks ago, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security told the Senate that these protections “place our communities at risk” and should be terminated or amended. And the flurry of news over the weekend has only made the situation worse. Mr. Trump and administration officials are using the misplaced public outrage as a pretext to call again for the repeal of the law protecting children. So far, these protections remain on the books, but the administration is already actively undermining them. Within his first few hours on the job in March 2017, Scott Lloyd, O.R.R.’s director, imposed a new policy requiring that he personally approve the release of any immigrant child who has needed heightened supervision while in custody. (Heightened supervision can result from genuine behavioral problems or trumped-up gang allegations.) As a result, over 740 children in O.R.R. custody in the past year have been unable to get out unless Mr. Lloyd — a Trump appointee with no background in child welfare — approves it. In New York, dozens of affected children have now been detained on average for eight months, and some for over a year — even though many seek release to a parent in the United States. Our organization, the New York Civil Liberties Union, sued to stop the practice, and a federal court in Manhattan will hear argument on that case on June 7. "
187,"WASHINGTON — Rebecca Slaughter’s recent Monday morning started out in a pretty typical way for a working mother of a newborn. She woke at 2 a.m. to feed, burp and change the diaper on her then-7-week-old daughter, Pippa. She repeated the routine three hours later. By 6:30 a.m., Ms. Slaughter checked her email and schedule while fixing breakfast for her two older children, ages 3 and 5. Her commute started at 8, driving her Honda minivan from her home in Bethesda, Md., a Washington suburb, while hooked up to a hands-free electric breast pump. It was when she arrived at the office about a half-hour later that her day took an unusual turn. She checked into the neoclassical Federal Trade Commission Building in the nation’s capital, with Pippa in tow, as one of the country’s top business regulators — and the first to do the job with a baby in the office. [The topics new parents are talking about. Evidence-based guidance. Personal stories that matter.

It was the imperfect but best solution for Ms. Slaughter, whose appointment in March to serve as an F.T.C. commissioner just happened to coincide with the birth of her third child. "

What does the confusion reveal about President Trump’s approach to immigration? On today’s episode: • Caitlin Dickerson, a national immigration reporter for The New York Times. Background reading: • An official with the Department of Health and Human Services said that the agency had not been able to contact 1,475 migrant children it had placed with sponsors in the United States. The children had entered the country as unaccompanied minors; many were fleeing violence in Central America. • The Trump administration says it separates immigrant families only when necessary to protect the child. But the government’s own figures show this has happened in more than 700 cases. • The number of children who were unaccounted for was conflated with the number of children who been separated from their guardians in a public outcry that gave rise to hashtags like #WhereAreTheChildren.

The Fed, according to  The Wall Street Journal, last year judged Deutsche Bank’s U.S. operations to be in a “troubled condition.” Also on Thursday, The Financial Times reported that the bank was on the F.D.I.C.’s list of “problem banks.” The Fed’s censure, according to the Journal, stemmed from concerns about Deutsche Bank’s procedures for measuring its exposure to its clients and for valuing the collateral backing its loans. Regulators require efficient and accurate controls so that banks can assess their financial strength and the risks they face, especially through difficult times in the economy. "
190,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Puerto Rico. When President Trump traveled to Puerto Rico last October after Hurricane Maria, he touted the storm’s low death toll as proof that his administration had done its job well. “Every death is a horror,” he said. “But if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina … what is your death count, as of this moment? 17?” He was very wrong. The true death toll could exceed 4,600, according to a study published this week in The New England Journal of Medicine that appears to be the most rigorous count yet. Many of the victims likely died from delayed medical care, which is something that a competent government response could have avoided. Puerto Rico’s fatality count is now more than twice as high as the Katrina count that Trump called a “real catastrophe.” It’s easy to overlook Puerto Rico with everything else going on — the latest news about Trump’s apparent efforts to obstruct justice, his continuing criticism of his own attorney general and so on. But I urge you to not forget Puerto Rico. Here is a selection of commentary on the new study: “There are life-and-death consequences to putting someone like Donald Trump in command of the federal government,” Slate’s Jamelle Bouie writes. “The profound failure of leadership and management that Trump’s critics feared has actually happened, and we are just now learning the scale of that disaster.” “If we had a responsible Congress that took oversight seriously there would be a top-to-bottom review” of the administration’s response, writes The Washington Post’s Jennifer Rubin. “But don’t hold your breath.” On Twitter, Refinery29’s Andrea González-Ramírez has compiled a list of the dead and invites others to add their loved ones’ names. “Most of these deaths were preventable,” she writes.

191,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) In the national consciousness, Stockton has had a run of bad associations. It suffered as an epicenter of the foreclosure crisis, and was a prime exhibit of how a city can plunge into bankruptcy. Now Stockton is becoming a laboratory for an idea capturing attention worldwide as a potential means of making life more economically secure for all. It is readying plans to begin a trial of so-called Universal Basic Income, handing out cash grants to several hundred local families, no strings attached. Finland has tested the idea. Trials have been underway in Oakland and in Canada. But Stockton is set to become the first American city to embrace the idea from City Hall itself. That a city in California has made itself a venue for the idea seems no accident. The state has long tried fresh approaches to governance. Ahead of the state’s political primaries on Tuesday, much of the conversation has centered on concerns about economic inequality. The project in Stockton is the product of a partnership between the city’s history-making, social-media savvy mayor, Michael Tubbs, and a philanthropic foundation headed by the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. Silicon Valley has taken a shine to basic income as a way to soften the effects of its creations — a potential army of robots poised to capture jobs from humans. But Stockton wants to demonstrate a different aspect of basic income’s appeal: its potential to alleviate the troubles of the working poor. "
192,"President Trump is expected to receive a letter from the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, hand-delivered by his envoy, on Friday afternoon, as the president and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, voice optimism about efforts to reinstate a canceled summit meeting with Mr. Kim. But on Thursday, Mr. Kim also welcomed a top Russian official to Pyongyang, offering a reminder that competing powers could still buffet the White House’s effort to salvage the meeting. Mr. Pompeo, who met over two days with a senior emissary of Mr. Kim in New York, said on Thursday that he was “confident we are moving in the right direction.” It would be “nothing short of tragic to let this opportunity go to waste,” Mr. Pompeo said after two and a half hours of discussions with Kim Yong-chol, the former North Korean intelligence chief and top nuclear arms negotiator. “If these talks are successful, they will truly be historic.” The diplomacy is expected to continue on Friday in Washington. Still, as the pace of diplomacy accelerated in the United States, Kim Jong-un was conducting his own outreach to a major American adversary at home. Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov became the first senior Russian official to meet with the young North Korean leader, extending an invitation from President Vladimir V. Putin for Mr. Kim to visit Moscow. Mr. Lavrov called for the lifting of sanctions on North Korea — the centerpiece of Mr. Trump’s strategy for drawing the North to the bargaining table — and endorsed moves toward reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula.

193,"WELD COUNTY, Colo. — A new oil rig will rise behind a middle school in this sprawling county in the coming months, its slender tower bearing an announcement: fracking is back. After a downturn that began in 2015, oil and gas production is booming again, and new projects are sprouting along American freeways and padding government budgets, cheered by state legislatures, the fossil fuel industry and the Trump administration. But this growth is also spurring a return of the turmoil that accompanied the last boom, pitting neighbor against neighbor and communities against companies in a fight over which projects should be allowed to pierce the land. In few places is that tension more evident than along Colorado’s Front Range, where a fracking boom is colliding with a population explosion. Drilling applications in the state have risen 70 percent in just a year, while the area north of Denver is expected to double in population by 2050. In Weld County — the center of the state’s oil and gas activity and home to more than 23,000 active wells — that tension has converged at a school called Bella Romero Academy. Just behind the school, workers are laying the foundation for a 24-well project that will pull oil and gas from the earth as students race across the playground. "
194,"President Trump is putting forward a nominee who is virulently anti-immigrant to be assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, a job I used to hold in the Obama administration. The nomination, announced last week, is only the latest move by the administration to chip away at our standing as the world’s top backer of humanitarian efforts. The new nominee, Ronald Mortensen, has made his positions on immigration issues clear as a fellow of the Center for Immigration Studies. For example, he has insisted that most of the Dreamers — undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children — have committed felonies. But his likely hostility to the mission of the bureau is not unique: the administration has named several immigration hard-liners to key posts. Rather, Mr. Mortensen’s nomination needs to be understood as part of a campaign to change America’s long tradition of welcoming refugees and immigrants and offering sanctuary to the persecuted. President Trump’s anti-Muslim travel ban, announced shortly after his inauguration, was the first salvo in this campaign. Even with courts overturning various versions of the ban, the White House has succeeded in slashing the number of refugees admitted to the United States to the lowest level in years — from 85,000 in the last full year of the Obama administration to as few as 20,000 projected for this year. The network of faith-based and secular charities around the United States that support refugee families to create new lives is disintegrating. With so few refugees being admitted, the State Department has announced plans to no longer fund some of these groups. The result is that fewer cities will be involved in the resettlement programs, the staff and volunteers who help refugees will disperse, and we will lose part of a highly successful public-private partnership. Lost, too, will be the proven economic and cultural benefits additional refugees would bring and the chance for a fresh start they desperately need. While refugee aid delivered overseas through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees remains at robust levels, this is primarily because of bipartisan support in Congress. Other United Nations agencies, however, have been cut off. The White House stopped funding the United Nations Population Fund, saying it was involved in forced abortions and sterilizations, an assertion it denies. The agency plays an essential role in seeing to the reproductive health of displaced women and improving survival rates for mothers and babies, and in 2016, I celebrated when the 5,000th baby was born alive and healthy in its clinic in the Zaatri refugee camp in Jordan. The agency now reports there are 64,000 pregnant Rohingya in the squalor of refugee camps in Bangladesh who need help to deliver their babies safely. The Trump administration also cut its funding of the United Nations agency that runs schools and provides health care to Palestinian refugees by more than 80 percent after Palestinians and United Nations member states criticized the decision to move the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The reduction has resulted in what a United Nations representative has called an “unprecedented financial crisis.” Left unclear is how punishing the poorest Palestinians helps an already tense situation. "
195,"Racist comments don’t hurt my feelings. Not at all. However, I find that people assume that they are hurtful, both the persons spewing them and those empathic about the perceived pain. But I register no such pain. I’m from the Toni Morrison school of morality on the subject of race. As she once told Charlie Rose: “I always knew that I had the high ground, all my life. I always thought those people who said I couldn’t come in the drugstore, and I had to sit in this funny place, and I couldn’t go in the park — —” Rose interjects: “You felt morally superior to them from Day 1.” Morrison continued: “I did. And I thought they knew that I knew that they were inferior to me, morally. I always thought that, and my parents always thought that.” You see, racism is a moral corruption built on an intellectual fallacy and exists as a construction invented for the very purpose of violence. So, when people demonstrate that they subscribe to theories of racism, they have shown their hand, and I am immediately roused by the euphoric understanding that they are compromised, diminished and assailable. Instead of reducing me, their racism reduces them. That is the ironic, poetic justice of it. Of course, one only has to think about it for a moment to find the enormous hole in the logic that racism morally weakens the object of the sickness rather than the possessor of the sickness. Although it doesn’t hurt my feelings, it does enrage me when racists are granted power in society to allow their idiocy to have a negative impact on other people, whether that be culturally, psychologically and spiritually, or materially and physically. "
196,"Last year, I predicted the government’s case to block the merger of AT&T and Time Warner would most likely be the antitrust case of the decade. That may prove to be an understatement. Since then, a pipeline has filled with megadeals awaiting the case’s outcome, which the judge presiding over the fight has said will come in less than two weeks. Rarely has Wall Street awaited a court ruling with such bated breath. Comcast, which earlier bid for the bulk of 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets but lost out to Disney, is readying a new bid to disrupt that deal. Verizon approached CBS about a deal last year, one reason CBS is trying to avoid a merger with Viacom. (Verizon executives have cast doubt on such a deal.) T-Mobile has been so emboldened as to bid for Sprint, after having the government block such a proposal just four years ago. Gene Kimmelman, former general counsel for the Justice Department’s antitrust division and chief executive of Public Knowledge, an advocate for an open internet, predicted that if AT&T wins, “the floodgates could really open up.” “You’ve already got Comcast,” he added. “Verizon and Charter Communications won’t be far behind.” Many on Wall Street seem to have decided that an AT&T victory is all but a sure thing. In one sign of growing investor confidence that the deal would go through, Time Warner shares have been inching higher this year, currently trading above $93, after cratering last fall when the government filed its lawsuit. It’s not hard to see why investors expect the companies to prevail. Court challenges to so-called vertical mergers like this one — Time Warner supplies content to AT&T — are less likely to succeed than those against mergers of direct competitors. That is because they don’t reduce the number of competitors. Until now, the government hadn’t litigated a vertical merger case in decades. The government’s post-trial legal brief was conspicuously short on precedents, because there aren’t many. "
197,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s use of his constitutional power to pardon criminals is proving to be as idiosyncratic as other aspects of his presidency. On Thursday, he pardoned Dinesh D’Souza, a conservative author convicted of making illegal campaign contributions, and he said he was considering commuting the sentence of former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois, a Democrat, and pardoning Martha Stewart, the lifestyle guru. He has also pardoned I. Lewis Libby Jr., a former aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, and Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff. The Constitution gives presidents what appears to be unlimited authority to grant pardons. He “shall have the power,” Article II says, “to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.” The pardon power extends only to federal crimes. Otherwise, presidents are free to use it as they see fit. As the Supreme Court put it in an 1866 decision involving a former Confederate senator, Ex Parte Garland, the power “is unlimited.” “It extends,” the court said, “to every offense known to the law.” In a tweet last year, Mr. Trump indicated that he had studied the matter. “All agree the U.S. president has the complete power to pardon,” he wrote. No. Other presidents have relied on recommendations from the Justice Department’s Office of the Pardon Attorney. The office has an elaborate and lengthy process for considering pardon applications. It generally requires a five-year waiting period, the office’s application instructions say, “to afford the petitioner a reasonable period of time in which to demonstrate an ability to lead a responsible, productive and law-abiding life.” "
198,"The pornographic film actress Stephanie Clifford sued President Trump’s fixer, Michael D. Cohen, and her own former lawyer on Wednesday, making public a set of text messages discussing efforts to quash the story of her alleged affair with Mr. Trump as it emerged early this year. The suit, filed in California State Court, accused Keith M. Davidson, the Beverly Hills lawyer who represented Ms. Clifford in 2016, of violating attorney-client privilege. It also said he withheld relevant communications from her and her current lawyer, Michael Avenatti. The suit accused Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, of helping and encouraging Mr. Davidson to breach his professional duties of confidentiality and loyalty to his client this year. In 2016, Mr. Cohen paid her $130,000 shortly before the election to keep quiet about the alleged affair. The legal challenge is at least the third that Mr. Avenatti has brought in the last three months on behalf of Ms. Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels. The suit intensifies the legal pressures on Mr. Cohen, who has been a subject of Ms. Clifford’s earlier complaints, and brings Mr. Davidson directly into the fray of civil litigation for the first time. In April, Ms. Clifford sued Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump for defamation, and in March, she sued to be released from the nondisclosure agreement. That suit has been delayed as a federal corruption investigation in New York scrutinizes Mr. Cohen and the $130,000. "
199,"LOS ANGELES — In most elections, the primary is the season for partisanship and appealing to the party’s most ideological voters. Candidates slide to the center — appealing, in theory, to a broader electorate with a more moderate message — as they shift into a general election. But even before most of the votes were counted, two of the candidates running to be the next governor of California — Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor, and John Cox, a Republican businessman — made clear that they were inclined to stay in their ideological corners. If Mr. Newsom and Mr. Cox continue down this road, the election for governor is going to offer as stark an ideological choice as voters are going to find in just about any ballot booth in the country: on health care, taxes, immigration, government spending and President Trump. And it comes at a time when California has become the center of Democratic resistance to Republican policies, and after eight years in which the current governor, Jerry Brown, has struck a decidedly more moderate tone in governing. [Go here for full results from California’s primary.] Celebrating on Tuesday night, Mr. Newsom offered a sweeping view of what he wants California’s government to achieve: guaranteed health care for all, a “Marshall Plan” to build affordable housing and an end to childhood poverty. “I honestly think this is a great opportunity, at scale, in a state as large as ours, to contrast visions,” Mr. Newsom said to reporters Wednesday in San Francisco, his first campaign stop since his primary victory.

201,"GUANGZHOU, China — A crisis over a mysterious ailment sickening American diplomats and their families — which began in Cuba and recently appeared in China — has widened as the State Department evacuated at least two more Americans from China on Wednesday. The Americans who were evacuated worked at the American Consulate in the southern city of Guangzhou, and their colleagues and family members are being tested by a State Department medical team, officials said. It is unclear how many of them are exhibiting symptoms, but a State Department spokeswoman said Wednesday evening that “a number of individuals” had been sent to the United States for further testing. For months, American officials have been worried that their diplomats have been subjected to targeted attacks involving odd sounds, leading to symptoms similar to those “following concussion or minor traumatic brain injury,” the State Department says. The cases in China have broadened a medical mystery that started in 2016, when American Embassy employees and their family members began falling ill in Havana. In all, 24 of them were stricken with headaches, nausea, hearing loss, cognitive issues and other symptoms after saying they heard odd sounds. The issue has roiled relations with Cuba, which immediately fell under suspicion, and led the United States to expel Cuban diplomats. But with Americans now exhibiting similar symptoms in Guangzhou, American officials have raised suspicions about whether other countries, perhaps China or Russia, might be to blame. "
202,"PARIS — Taking aim at so-called fake news, France’s Parliament on Thursday is set to begin debating a tough bill aimed at repressing phony news items, one pushed by President Emmanuel Macron amid criticism that it poses a potential threat to press freedom. The measure would allow judges to block content deemed false during a three-month period preceding an election. Mr. Macron, stung last year by a phony internet-spread story claiming he had an offshore account in the Bahamas, has made fighting “fake news” a priority. His opponent, the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, brought up the Bahamas story during a critical presidential debate. Now, she is attacking the proposed law as a “liberty killer.” Shortly after the new year, Mr. Macron told a press gathering that he would aim to “protect our democracy from these false stories” by cracking down on phony reports. “In an instant,” through thousands of accounts, the president said, “lies created to sully a politician, a personality, a public figure, a journalist can spread throughout the world, in every language.” Under the new law, judges would have 48 hours to decide if “any allegation or imputation” in a news item was “devoid of verifiable elements that would make it credible.” Only items written “in bad faith” could be blocked, and again it would be up to the judge to decide.

This week, we’ve got hot tips for staying cool, an update about drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and a few words from Republican lawmakers about Scott Pruitt. Air-conditioning may be as American as apple pie. More than 90 percent of United States households now have air-conditioners. But our love of cool indoor spaces is contributing to climate change, as we recently reported. By midcentury, the world may use as much electricity powering its air-conditioners as China currently uses for all activities. In the process, the carbon emissions created by generating all that electricity could double. How can we lower air-conditioning’s climate impact? To find the most efficient air-conditioners, look for Energy Star ratings, said Mina Agarabi, a mechanical engineer and consultant who focuses on the operation and maintenance of mechanical systems. These models may cost a bit more upfront, but we recoup those costs through reduced energy costs over the long term. “But it isn’t just about buying the most efficient unit,” said Ms. Agarabi. “It’s also about sizing it correctly.” "
204,"— President Trump, speaking at a briefing at FEMA headquarters on Wednesday. The United States has exported energy sources like coal, natural gas, petroleum and electricity for decades, so Mr. Trump is wrong that this is happening for the first time. Asked on Wednesday for clarification, the White House referred to the Energy Information Administration’s latest annual outlook, which projected that the United States would become a net energy exporter by 2022 — meaning that at that point, the country will export more energy than it imports. That’s neither “now” nor the “first time.” Currently, the United States is still a net importer. Additionally, data from the energy statistical agency shows that the United States was a net exporter for several years before 1953.   The White House also cited a March report from the House Committee on Energy and Commerce that said the United States became a net exporter of liquefied natural gas in 2017 — the first time since 1957. The United States is and has been a net energy exporter of coal since at least 1949. Conversely, the country has relied on foreign oil imports since the 1950s. "

206,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — For Deb Haaland, the New Mexico community activist seeking to make history in her bid to become the first Native American woman elected to Congress, proclaiming defiance to the Trump administration has echoes in the brutal history of the Southwest. “How can we not be outraged by the separation of families?” Ms. Haaland asked in an interview on Wednesday, referring to the government’s intensifying crackdown on undocumented immigrants crossing the border with Mexico. “It’s like we’re reliving the past.” In an explicitly progressive campaign emphasizing her criticism of Mr. Trump on matters ranging from immigration to tribal sovereignty, Ms. Haaland, 57, shook New Mexico’s political establishment by sailing to a primary victory on Tuesday over five Democratic opponents in a district encompassing Albuquerque. Some voters attributed Ms. Haaland’s win, which may position her favorably in the general election against Janice Arnold-Jones, a Republican, to her pioneering effort to frame issues from a Native American perspective in a state long dominated by Anglo and Hispanic politicians. “Deb has been forceful in challenging a president known for his discriminatory remarks about native peoples,” said Cheryl Fairbanks, executive director of the Native American Budget and Policy Institute, a group in Albuquerque seeking to empower indigenous communities. “We’ve endured federal policies aimed at terminating and marginalizing us, so it’s unifying to have someone to speak with such pride of her native background,” Ms. Fairbanks said. “We’re on the cusp of a historic moment if she wins.” "
207,"WASHINGTON — NASA is working on plans to commercialize the International Space Station, which currently costs up to $4 billion a year to maintain, the agency’s new administrator said on Wednesday. Jim Bridenstine said the agency will consider “a range of options” to make private operation of the space station feasible. “Some of it might be that the I.S.S. wouldn’t exist in its current form,” he said. “But maybe it gets split into a number of different components. Some of it could be de-orbited.” Mr. Bridenstine said no decision has been made, but that President Trump’s budget proposal in February put the agency’s privatization efforts “on steroids.” The administration has proposed eliminating direct federal contributions to the space station by 2025 and allocating $150 million to develop “commercial successors,” including companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Blue Origin, which was started by Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon. Seven in ten Americans still believe the United States government should remain a world leader in space exploration, despite the growing role of private companies, according to a study published on Wednesday by Pew Research Center.

208,"We are now going to explain the War of 1812 to you. Why not? We didn’t think we’d find ourselves here, either. But on Wednesday, CNN reported that the 206-year-old war figured prominently in a discussion between President Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada on May 25. According to CNN’s unnamed sources, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Trudeau, “Didn’t you guys burn down the White House?” The New York Times then confirmed the CNN report, as did The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It’s unclear if the president was trying to make a joke during what was, reportedly, a tense call about his decision to impose steep tariffs on metals imported from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Any lesson on the War of 1812 probably isn’t the most vivid memory people have from their high school history classes, so its details may be fuzzy to many. And with the war suddenly in the news and the butt of jokes on social media, they might fairly wonder: Well, did Canada burn down the White House? No, Canada did not burn down the White House during the War of 1812, which was fought with Britain over maritime rights. What is now Canada was not yet a country in 1812, but rather British colonies. Canada didn’t become a nation until 1867, long after British troops did, in fact, burn down the White House in 1814. The fire gutted the president’s house along with several other crucial structures in Washington, which was still a relatively small town when the seat of government moved there 14 years earlier. “The inferno was so great that the glow in the night sky was seen from 50 miles away,” the White House Historical Association wrote.

209,"Californians went to the polls on Tuesday in a primary election that was a big deal for the country: How the vote went in several competitive congressional districts was being closely watched as a barometer of the chances Democrats have to take control of Congress in November. National politics aside, there were several other significant issues at stake; here are several takeaways for Californians. Much of the chatter before the primary focused on California’s unusual election system in which the top two vote getters — regardless of party affiliation — moved to the general election in November. Going into Tuesday, many national Democratic leaders worried that they had too many candidates in some crucial congressional races, raising the possibility they would be shut out in some contests — and two Republicans would face off in November. Adding to the debate was the steady erosion of the Republican Party in California — which has slipped to third-party status, with more residents identifying as independents. But, once the results rolled in, the outcome became clear: partisanship still matters, even in California, and most races come November will likely be traditional contests between a Democrat and a Republican. Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor and former mayor of San Francisco, will face John Cox, a Republican businessman, in the race for governor, and it looks as if Democrats will not be shut out of any congressional races. “The primary reminded us just how partisan our elections tend to be,” said Mark Baldassare, the chief executive of the Public Policy Institute of California. “And how deeply divided our parties are in the types of candidates they choose.” "
210,"WASHINGTON — Republican lawmakers in the House are hurtling toward a collision over immigration, raising the prospect of a divisive and uncomfortably public intraparty fight just five months before November’s midterm elections. And party leaders are running out of time to stop it. In the face of a rebellion from moderate members, who are on the brink of forcing a series of immigration votes over the objections of Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republicans will meet privately on Thursday morning to discuss the issue. “Our members are earnest and sincere in trying to understand each other’s perspectives,” Mr. Ryan told reporters on Wednesday, adding, “I really do believe that there is a sweet spot here.” At the center of their discussions is the fate of hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children — known as Dreamers. Here’s a guide to the impending showdown. The approaching collision among Republicans has been long in the making. In September, President Trump moved to rescind an Obama-era program that shielded young undocumented immigrants from deportation, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. He gave Congress six months to take action on the matter. The Senate tried but came up empty, as three different immigration plans failed in the chamber in February. And because the courts have kept DACA alive for now, lawmakers — who thrive on hard deadlines — have felt less urgency to deal with the issue. "
211,"Shock! Horror! President Trump is actually doing something right. Sadly, Democrats in Congress are responding in a quite Trumpian way: They seem more concerned with undermining him than supporting a peace process with North Korea. They are on the same side as National Security Adviser John Bolton, quietly subverting attempts to pursue peace. While international security is complicated, here’s a rule of thumb: When you find yourself on the same side as Bolton, go back and re-examine your position. Sure, we all wish that Trump treated Justin Trudeau or Angela Merkel with the respect that he now shows Kim Jong-un. Yes, it seems that Trump has been played by Kim. Yet another way of putting it is that Trump is finally investing in the kind of diplomatic engagement that he used to denounce, and that we should all applaud. Trump’s newfound pragmatism is infinitely preferable to the threat of nuclear war that used to hang over all of us, so it’s mystifying to see Democrats carping about any possible North Korea deal. “Any deal that explicitly or implicitly gives North Korea sanctions relief for anything other than the verifiable performance of its obligations to dismantle its nuclear and missile arsenal is a bad deal,” seven Democratic senators, including Chuck Schumer, warned in a letter to Trump this week. The letter also insisted on “anywhere, anytime” inspections of suspected North Korean nuclear sites, as well as those linked to its chemical and biological warfare programs. "
212,"In a commencement address at the Naval Academy last month, President Trump revisited a familiar theme. He remarked to the graduates: “Winning is such a great feeling, isn’t it? Winning is such a great feeling. Nothing like winning — you got to win.” He later repeated the idea: “Victory, winning, beautiful words, but that is what it is all about.” This focus on victory is not new for Mr. Trump. During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump promised that under his leadership the audience would “get bored with winning.” He predicted that his fans would grow “so sick and tired of winning, you’re going to come to me and go, ‘Please, please, we can’t win anymore,’” and “I’m going to say, ‘I’m sorry but we’re going to keep winning, winning, winning.’” The focus on winning is not incidental. It caters to a very primal need among humans to feel that we’re part of a group whose status is high and protected. This winning “we” is often a divisive concept, turning Americans against their fellow citizens. The story of how American politics has grown ever more focused on partisan victory instead of the greater good of the nation has two major components. First, it is fundamental human nature to want our groups to win. Social psychological research pioneered by the Polish psychologist Henri Tajfel (who survived six years in a Nazi prison camp) worked to determine why groups of people try to destroy each other. Through a series of experiments called the “minimal group paradigm,” Mr. Tajfel tried to locate the weakest level of group identification, the point at which people would not discriminate against an opposing group. To his surprise, he couldn’t find it. No matter how he divided up the subjects in his study (overestimators versus underestimators, Klee-lovers versus Kandinsky-lovers), they had a bias for the group they were in and a bias against the group they weren’t members of. In a money allocation task, participants were given a choice between both groups receiving the maximum amount of money, or the subjects’ in-group receiving less than the maximum, but more than the out-group. People reliably chose group victory. Mr. Tajfel explained this by linking our group status to our individual status. When our group wins, we feel like winners. When our group loses, we feel like losers. And we’re willing to sacrifice real resources for that sense of victory. "
213,"Food delivery. Sanctuary. Those are often the anchors for the more than half a million undocumented immigrants who live and work in New York City. But an incident at the United States Army base in Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, last week has called those foundations into question, and provoked new tension in the city’s battle with federal immigration authorities over protections for immigrants without legal status. Pablo Villavicencio Calderon, 35, an undocumented immigrant, was making a delivery from a brick-oven pizza restaurant in Queens to the Army base next to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge on Friday before lunchtime. According to his wife, Sandra Chica, he presented a New York City identification card, as he had done in the past. The card, provided through a program called IDNYC, was supposed to give undocumented immigrants a method of proving their identification when dealing with city agencies, including the schools system and the Police Department, neither of which is allowed to ask about immigration status. But on that day, Ms. Chica said, it was not enough for the military police officer on duty, who said Mr. Villavicencio needed a driver’s license, which he did not have. A background check revealed an open order of deportation from 2010. Military personnel detained him and called Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, who took him into custody, an official for the immigration agency said. "
214,"LOS ANGELES — A federal judge in San Diego on Wednesday refused to dismiss a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s practice of taking children from immigrants when they arrive at the border to seek asylum, ruling that the “wrenching separation” of families may violate the Constitution’s guarantees of due process. “Such conduct, if true, as it is assumed to be on the present motion, is brutal, offensive, and fails to comport with traditional notions of fair play and decency,” Judge Dana M. Sabraw of the Southern District of California wrote in his 25-page opinion. The judge rejected the government’s claim that the practice of family separations — one of the most controversial features of the government’s crackdown on illegal immigration — cannot be challenged on constitutional grounds, though he did dismiss a separate challenge claiming that the practice violates asylum laws. The ruling in the case, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, suggests the court would be open to considering a claim that taking children away from parents who are legally trying to seek asylum in the United States constitutes a violation of the family’s rights to due process. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced last month that the administration would criminally prosecute everyone who illegally crosses the Southwest border, in what he called a “zero tolerance” policy intended to deter new migrants, mainly from Central America. In most of those cases, children traveling with those immigrants are now taken to separate detention facilities, often hundreds or thousands of miles away. "
215,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. France’s fake-news battle, Britain’s most expensive divorce and Spain’s new government. Here’s the latest: • France takes aim at “fake news.” France’s Parliament is set to begin debating a bill aimed at repressing phony news items amid criticism that they pose a threat to democracy. The legislation would give judges 48 hours to decide whether to block content they deem false during a three-month period preceding an election. Journalists fear the measure undermines press freedom, while the political opposition views it as a power grab by President Emmanuel Macron, above. “The potential risk in this law is if it winds up in the hands of a government with the wrong motives,” said one Socialist member of Parliament. Meanwhile, European leaders asked the Trump administration to exempt E.U. companies from American sanctions that would be imposed as a result of President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. _____ "
216,"Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, “got back on his hands and knees and begged” for the United States to revive the Singapore summit meeting after President Trump abruptly scrapped it last month, one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said Wednesday. The remarks by Mr. Giuliani, apparently intended to portray Mr. Trump as a tough negotiator, may have lobbed a disruptive obstacle into the salvaged meeting less than a week before it is set to happen. The remarks could easily offend officials in North Korea, where a cultlike autocracy exalts Mr. Kim as a deity who cannot be seen as servile and weak. “If the North Koreans needed a reason to cancel the meeting, the Americans just gave it to them,” said Evans J.R. Revere, a former State Department diplomat who specializes in North Korea. Mr. Giuliani made the remarks in Israel during a capital markets conference, where he was explaining the head-spinning sequence of events that led Mr. Trump to cancel and then revive the summit meeting. Mr. Trump abruptly announced the cancellation on May 24 after a North Korean official threatened a “nuclear-to-nuclear showdown” with the United States and called Vice President Mike Pence a “political dummy” for having suggested that Mr. Kim had asked for the meeting under pressure. The North Koreans also were offended by John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, who has expressed hostility toward the North and has insisted that it disarm before other issues can be discussed. "
217,"WASHINGTON — Students, parents and educators urged the federal officials charged with preventing the next school shooting to pour more mental health resources and school support staff into the nation’s elementary and secondary schools — not more guns. The first public forum of the federal commission on school safety, convened by President Trump after the February school shooting in Parkland, Fla., drew dozens of speakers from across the country to the Department of Education on Wednesday. But neither Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the commission’s chairwoman, nor the other three cabinet secretaries appointed to the panel were in attendance. On Tuesday, Ms. DeVos told senators that the commission would not wade into the gun control debate, but panel officials said they would follow Mr. Trump’s order to examine age restrictions on some weapons. Alessia Modjarrad, a recent graduate of a Montgomery County, Md., high school, criticized what she called the commission’s “complicit” stance on the role of guns in school safety. “I don’t want to be scared. I don’t want to think that at any moment someone with a gun could walk in and hurt us all,” Ms. Modjarrad said. “Please consider the possibilities that guns are the most important aspect of the purview of this commission.” The speakers’ demands largely echoed the responses that liberal advocacy groups have pointed to since the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School: more anti-violence programs, more mental health resources and better coordination between school and law enforcement officials in trying to identify at-risk students. "
218,"WASHINGTON — Federal agents arrested nearly 52,000 people at the Southwest border in May, according to data released on Wednesday by the Department of Homeland Security, as the number of migrants trying to enter the United States continued to rise. The arrests in May — the third month in a row of increases — follow the Trump administration’s tough stance against illegal immigration, including sending thousands of National Guard troops to the border and a “zero tolerance” policy that seeks to prosecute people who illegally enter the country. The new policy has resulted in hundreds of children being separated from their parents. The new arrest data suggests such measures have not deterred migrants, many of whom undertake the long trek from Central America to escape violent gangs and drug cartels. The Trump administration has used monthly apprehension figures as a barometer for how well its get-tough policies have fared in stopping illegal immigration. But on Wednesday a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security played down the significance of the monthly figures. “No one expects to reverse years of political inaction overnight or in a month,” the spokesman, Tyler Q. Houlton, said in a statement. “It is also clear change will take more than administration action alone.” "
219,"In Trump’s America people are understandably experiencing news fatigue. There are torrents of it on multiple streams. There is outrage after outrage. It is often overwhelming. That’s the plan, I suspect. Trump is operating on the Doctrine of Inundation. He floods the airwaves until you simply give up because you feel like you’re drowning. And unfortunately, it’s working. A Pew Research Center report released Tuesday found that nearly seven in 10 Americans “feel worn out by the amount of news there is these days.” Fighting this fatigue is the real test of a person’s resolve, including mine. When my enthusiasm for resisting this vile man and his corrupt administration starts to flag, I remember the episode that first revealed to me the darkness at Trump’s core, and I am renewed. On an April night nearly 30 years ago, a young investment banker was beaten and raped when she went for a jog in Central Park. The attack left her in a coma. She happened to be white. Five teenagers arrested for the crime — four black and one of Hispanic descent — went to trial. As this newspaper reported at the time, they were “in what the police said was part of a marauding spree by as many as 30 youths in the northern end of the park” that night. After being questioned for hours, the defendants gave false confessions that conflicted with one another, and those confessions were captured on video. As The New York Times pointed out in 2002: “The defendants in the jogger case were put on camera after they had been in custody, in some cases, for as long as 28 hours.” "
220,"WASHINGTON — Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, denied on Wednesday that Trump administration policies were driving up health insurance costs, which many experts expect to surge again in 2019. Mr. Azar, testifying before a House committee, vigorously disputed suggestions by Democrats that President Trump had sabotaged Affordable Care Act marketplaces, where millions of people obtain insurance subsidized by the federal government. In the market as it now exists, he said, “there’s no incentive for insurance companies to in any way contain their cost increases” because federal subsidies generally rise along with premiums. “Those prices are going to go up, and, absent statutory change, there’s little we can do to stop that premium increase because the subsidies chase those premiums,” Mr. Azar said. The Congressional Budget Office said the full unsubsidized premium for a benchmark midlevel plan in the marketplaces rose 34 percent this year, on average, and was likely to increase about 15 percent next year. But some insurers have already requested rate increases of more than 30 percent for 2019. Given this dynamic, Mr. Azar said, the Trump administration is trying to “make other options available to people” — less expensive insurance that will be exempt from many coverage requirements of the Affordable Care Act. "
221,"WASHINGTON — A rocky process has plagued President Trump’s attempt to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement from the start, as internal divisions and a thinly staffed bureaucracy often left big American companies with much at stake shut out of deliberations, according to internal administration emails. The White House approach has put the future of the 1994 trade pact in doubt and left Canada, Mexico and many of the biggest American companies frustrated and bewildered. Documents show corporations and trade groups — such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, or NAM — struggling to get their voices heard within a supposedly business-friendly administration and sending increasingly panicked emails to the United States trade representative’s office about its approach to rewriting the pact. Throughout last spring and summer, high-level trade negotiators repeatedly canceled meetings with the chamber, instead finally sending a 24-year-old deputy to meet with a delegation that was expected to include representatives from more than 50 of the largest American companies and organizations, including Walmart, U.P.S., the Walt Disney Company, General Electric, General Motors, Caterpillar and Boeing. Last August, ahead of the second round of Nafta negotiations in Mexico, an official at the United States Council for International Business pleaded for “an urgent meeting with you and your team before you head to Mexico for Round 2.” “I cannot emphasize enough the degree of concern in the business community based on the press reports we have seen of major changes in U.S. policy,” the official, Shaun Donnelly, wrote. A trade official set up a meeting for the next week. "
222,"PHILADELPHIA — After spending 24 hours in the center of a culture war, the Philadelphia Eagles shrugged off a white-hot controversy with earnest platitudes and easygoing humor. They spoke of diversity and activism, of team unity and the weather. And the team’s most prominent political figure declined to speak at all, choosing instead to let a series of handwritten poster boards do the talking. It was a stark contrast with his team’s and the N.F.L.’s very talkative antagonist, the President of the United States. This was a little more than one day after a planned White House celebration for the Eagles’ Super Bowl victory imploded into canceled plans and recriminations, with the Eagles reportedly planning to send only a few players and the White House press secretary accusing the team of “a political stunt.” Now it was time for an off-season practice (an “OTA,” or Organized Team Activity, in N.F.L.-speak) and the relief that came with returning to comparatively mundane subjects like blocking, tackling and catching footballs. “Glad to see so many people for an O.T.A. practice,” head coach Doug Pederson joked at a news conference at the Eagles’ practice complex near Lincoln Financial Field. Others were more direct and expansive. “We’ve come together as a team, the decisions that were made were made, and at the end of the day, for me it wasn’t a decision,” said Eagles defensive end Chris Long. Last season, Long expressed support for teammates who raised their arms during the playing of the national anthem and also donated his million-dollar base salary to educational initiatives. He said that he had not planned to attend the traditional White House celebration for the Super Bowl victor well before it was canceled. "
223,"BUENOS AIRES — A decision by Argentina’s national soccer team to cancel a World Cup warm-up match against Israel after protests by Palestinian activists has set off hand-wringing and recrimination here in a nation obsessed with the sport and geopolitics. Argentina’s soccer federation canceled the game on Tuesday and confirmed it on Wednesday, weeks after Israel had moved it from the coastal city of Haifa to Jerusalem, a city that is a focal point in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. The change in location of the game ignited protests from Palestinian activists, who displayed bloodstained shirts at a demonstration in Barcelona, where Argentina is practicing for the World Cup beginning June 14. Both Israeli officials and officials with the Argentine Football Association said threats had been made against Lionel Messi, the star of Argentina’s national team, and other members of the team. “My responsibility as the president of the A.F.A. is to work for the safety of my people, which is why I made this decision,” the associations’s president, Claudio Tapia, said in a short statement to the news media in Barcelona. Changing the location of the game, a move pushed by Israel’s sports minister, Miri Regev, “turned a sporting event that had economic ends into a political issue and it became about supporting the state of Israel,” said Angela Lerena, an Argentine sports journalist. “Somebody at some point decided it could be a good propaganda opportunity.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel had called Argentine President Mauricio Macri of Argentina on Tuesday in an attempt to get the game back on. "
224,"What do the primary results from California, New Jersey and places in between bode for November? For the Times opinion columnists Frank Bruni and Ross Douthat, they mean plenty — and yet nothing definitive. Their discussion follows: Frank Bruni: Ross, although Americans less politically engaged than you and I probably wondered at that potent breeze, accompanied by a happy whistling sound, that emanated from California and blew eastward all the way to the Potomac, we recognized it instantly for what it was: an epic Democratic sigh of relief. Based on incomplete returns from the Tuesday primaries there, the party’s hopes for retaking control of the House after November are alive! Its candidates in the California districts that it’s striving to flip from red to blue did not get shut out of the general election by the state’s “top two” system, in which two Republicans could have been graduated to the next, decisive phase. Ross Douthat: True, the Democrats avoided calamity, and election handicappers gained, well, more ambiguity, it appears. Our colleague Nate Cohn spent Tuesday explaining that if the Democrats closed in on 50 percent of the vote in California’s key primaries — the districts held by Republican representatives and won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 — they would be on the pace they need to have a House-taking wave; if they consistently fell below 45 percent the wave would be receding. The provisional totals? 49, 37, 47, 44, 44, 46, 48. That looks like a gray zone to me, with the House very much in play, but the Democrats’ chances of taking it by no means as great as they would like. Bruni: This midterm election is refusing to hew to one clear pattern. Just a few weeks ago, in Omaha, a candidate of the left beat a more established Democrat in a fiercely contested primary, pretty much dooming the party in the general election, and there was ample talk of the main energy in the party being on the left. Tuesday’s results suggest otherwise, not just in California but in New Jersey, where the Democrats who won their primaries and will now compete in November are ones backed for the most part by the Democratic establishment — whatever that is. They’re well within the party’s mainstream. And of course Senator Dianne Feinstein prevailed handily in her California primary. So much for the Bernie Sanders insurgency. Douthat: I think generally there’s a lot more division between different Democratic factions on social media than there is in actual electoral politics. Our colleague David Leonhardt has written about how even in hard-fought primaries, like the one for governor in Georgia, the competing Democratic messages aren’t that far apart. And moderate incumbents like Feinstein and Montana’s Jon Tester won their primaries easily; indeed, it’s hard to think of a major Democratic incumbent who’s faced a sustained grass-roots challenge. Sure, Bob Menendez did surprisingly poorly in New Jersey — but he won, scandals and all. This is not a Democratic Party in the throes of its own Tea Party moment. It looks more unified, not less, than in 2016. "
225,"LONDON — Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has struck a conciliatory tone in the wake of a data-privacy scandal. That was not the case on Wednesday for the former chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, a consulting firm at the center of the controversy. Alexander Nix, who led Cambridge Analytica until it suspended him in March, defiantly shot back at accusations from British lawmakers that he or his company engaged in unethical business practices, abused information pulled from the social network or played a role in the British vote to leave the European Union. In a contentious hearing before Parliament’s media committee, Mr. Nix said Cambridge Analytica did at one point have data on millions of Facebook users. The data was harvested from the social network without the users’ consent. But, he said, Cambridge Analytica didn’t find the information useful and deleted it after a request from Facebook. His comments contradicted evidence presented by a former Cambridge Analytica employee, Christopher Wylie, who has said the data was central to Cambridge Analytica’s political consulting work for Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Wylie has also suggested that Cambridge Analytica did advising work for the Brexit vote. Mr. Nix criticized Mr. Wylie as a “bitter and jealous” former employee bent on sabotaging the company in order to start a rival business. “I’m sitting here and being subjected to frankly ridiculous accusations based on the most tenuous connections that simply aren’t supported by evidence,” Mr. Nix said when denying that Cambridge Analytica had worked for campaigns in favor of leaving the European Union. "
226,"LOS ANGELES — Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor and former mayor of San Francisco, took a major step Tuesday in his bid to become California’s next governor, capturing one of two spots on the November ballot as the state moved closer to the end of the era of Gov. Jerry Brown. John Cox, a Republican businessman backed by President Trump, captured the other spot, setting up what is — at best — a very long-shot bid for Mr. Cox in a decidedly Democratic state where Mr. Trump lost by nearly four million votes. Mr. Cox’s showing represented a major tactical victory for national Republicans as they seek to protect seven Republican-held congressional seats in California that Democrats are targeting as they try to recapture the House. Republican leaders, including Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader who comes from central California, had feared that having no Republicans running for a high-profile statewide office would diminish turnout among party voters in the fall. Importantly, Democrats seemed poised to avoid the disaster they feared in House races: Being shut out of the November balloting under the state’s so-called “top-two’’ primary system, in which only the top two finishers advance to the general election. But many of the districts had crowded primaries and in some of them votes were still being counted early Wednesday morning. The most-watched races here were seven congressional districts that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016 and that are now held by Republicans. Democrats are aiming to capture those seats in November, a linchpin of their strategy to take back control of the House. "

228,"Jordan Roth has put away his Prada suits. He had them in black, blue and gray, and they felt reassuring when he took over a small Broadway theater empire — a billionaire’s son facing more than a little skepticism about his readiness for an old-school job. Nine years later, at 42, he has become Broadway’s singular showman, pushing the boundaries of what it means — and, yes, what it looks like — to be a theater tycoon. In a famously flop-prone industry, he is wrapping up his best season ever — successfully luring not only Bruce Springsteen but also Disney (“Frozen”) and Tina Fey (“Mean Girls”) to his theaters, joining the long-running hits “The Book of Mormon” and “Kinky Boots.” He has three Tony Awards as a producer, and this weekend he is vying for a fourth, for a starry revival of “Angels in America.” As his confidence has grown, so has his appetite for provocative self-expression. He has become a red carpet magnet, thanks to his luxuriant locks and penchant for avant-garde couture. And he is producing and hosting a biting series of web videos that take aim at the coarsening of American culture and its association with President Trump. "
229,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has made a trademark of upending many of the diplomatic traditions that have defined American foreign policy for decades, angering a host of longtime allies. Now, a growing number of his ambassadors are doing the same. This week, Richard Grenell, the newly installed United States ambassador in Berlin, outraged some in Germany when he told Breitbart London that he wanted to “empower other conservatives throughout Europe,” a direct political threat to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition. Germany’s Foreign Ministry asked for a clarification. Last week, David M. Friedman, the ambassador to Israel, told an Israeli newspaper, “There’s no question Republicans support Israel more than Democrats,” making an explicitly partisan argument that is generally forbidden among ambassadors. And earlier this year, Peter Hoekstra, the ambassador to the Netherlands, refused to respond to a room full of Dutch journalists who asked him to clarify false statements he had made in 2015 that politicians and cars had been burned by Muslims in the country. He has apologized. There is nothing new about ambassadors making unfortunate remarks. But the growing list of top envoys who have provoked controversy even in posts of close allies, where diplomatic duties largely include party-giving and anodyne cheerleading, has been unusual — and, for the Trump administration, potentially perilous. The administration is using its envoys, “even in our closest allies, to advance a nationalist and very aggressive agenda rather than maintain cordial relations,” said Nancy McEldowney, who had helped to train ambassadors for their posts as the former director of the Foreign Service Institute.

230,"LONDON — With a spa, a swimming pool, two heliports and room for 18 guests, the Luna is more like a floating luxury villa than a yacht. A crew of 50 keep all nine decks in pristine shape. The lifeboats cost $4 million apiece. Gleaming engines propel the vessel at a maximum speed of 22 knots. But for now, the Luna isn’t moving. It sits in a dry dock in Dubai, the most fought-over prize in what has been called Britain’s most expensive divorce. In December 2016, a High Court judge ordered Farkhad Akhmedov, a Russian billionaire who has owned a home in England since the ’90s, to pay the equivalent of $646 million to his ex-wife, Tatiana Akhmedova. He refused, arguing that the couple had been divorced in Russia more than a decade ago. Unconvinced and unable to enforce his ruling, the judge in April ordered Mr. Akhmedov to hand over the yacht, valued at roughly $500 million, to his ex-wife. It has since been impounded by authorities in Dubai, where it had turned up for maintenance. For more than a decade, Russian oligarchs have been parking their families and some chunk of their net worth in England. A deal was implied: The oligarchs got a haven from the pitiless realities of Putin-era Russia, and Britain got an influx of very rich people. Now some oligarchs are learning that life here has hazards of its own. That goes even for nonresidents like Mr. Akhmedov, who never became a British citizen. Eager to keep British tax collectors away from his money, he limited the number of days he stayed in England to a maximum of 180 a year. (More recently, the number was reduced to 90 days.) "
231,"The night that ended far differently started out normal. It was Thursday at Mekelburg’s, a busy Brooklyn grocery with a cafe and bar in the back and picnic tables on the patio, with locals tucking into sandwiches and sipping craft beers. Everything changed at 7 p.m., when someone noticed a news story online. Word spread through the place like a rotten odor. Customers scanned their phones, looked up and signaled for the check. “By 8:15, we were completely empty,” said Alicia Guevara, who owns Mekelburg’s with her husband, Daniel Mekelburg. Slowly, she pieced together what had happened. HuffPost had just published a profile of a prolific Twitter firebrand from New York, a woman who frequently attacks Islam — one post warned that “500K Muslims will Invade Europe this Summer” — under the user name @AmyMek. The story revealed her full name, Amy Mekelburg, offered details about her family and mentioned a brother who “runs a popular restaurant and craft beer bar in Brooklyn that also bears the family name.” The backlash to the story was instantaneous and widespread, rattling even veterans of the high-volume, high-vitriol, endless shouting match that plays out on the fringes of ideological dividing lines in this country.

Stephen Colbert pressed former President Bill Clinton on Tuesday to explain why he had reacted defensively to questions on NBC’s “Today” show about his affair in the late 1990s with Monica Lewinsky, then a White House intern. In the interview, which aired Monday, Clinton had told Craig Melvin of NBC that he would not have changed his response to the scandal in light of the #MeToo movement. Clinton, who was appearing on “The Late Show” to promote the new novel he wrote with James Patterson, admitted that the “Today” interview “wasn’t my finest hour.” But then he doubled down on much of what he’d said. “I apologized to my family, to Monica Lewinsky and her family, to the American people. I meant it then, I meant it now,” Clinton said. “I’ve had to live with the consequences every day since. And I still believe this #MeToo movement is long overdue, necessary, and should be supported.” Yet Colbert kept at him, pointedly asking whether Clinton understood why journalists and #MeToo activists might be interested in reinvestigating his conduct.

233,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor of California and former mayor of San Francisco, captured one of two spots on the November ballot for governor. He will face John Cox, a Republican businessman backed by President Trump, in a state that Mr. Trump lost by nearly four million votes in 2016. New Jersey could prove as crucial as California in the contest for the House in November. Democratic leaders are hoping to flip as many as four of the five Republican-held districts in the state, and a former Navy pilot and a pro-gun state senator are among those who secured nominations. • Eight states held primaries on Tuesday, and results are still coming in. Follow live updates here. • One possible upshot of any deal that President Trump might strike with Kim Jong-un on June 12 in Singapore: more trade between North Korea and China. On a trip to the countries’ border, our Beijing bureau chief saw a shadow economy of cash couriers, short-term workers and gray-market traders that has persisted despite years of sanctions against North Korea. She also found excitement about the opportunities that the easing of sanctions could bring. Separately, Mexico hit the U.S. on Tuesday with tariffs on around $3 billion of American pork, steel, cheese and other goods. The move, a response to the Trump administration’s steel and aluminum levies, came as Washington suggested it wanted separate trade agreements with Mexico and Canada, rather than tweaks to the North American Free Trade Agreement. • And President Vladimir Putin of Russia is seeking to capitalize on widespread European disillusionment with Mr. Trump by getting the European Union to abandon economic sanctions on his country. "
234,"His confirmation as ambassador to Germany took a while, but when Richard Grenell arrived in Berlin in May he wasted no time riling up his new hosts. On his first day on the job, he tweeted that German companies doing business in Iran should “wind down operations immediately” because President Trump had decided to unilaterally withdraw from the painstakingly negotiated nuclear deal with Iran. Germans were not amused by an ambassador telling them what to do, but that hardly deterred our man in Berlin. What he did next was to give an outrageous and insulting interview over the weekend to Breitbart, summarized thus by the alt-right mouthpiece: “Trumpian U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell has expressed great excitement over the wave of conservatism in Europe, saying he wants to ‘empower’ leaders of the movement.” Mr. Trump was no doubt highly pleased by his envoy, a former United Nations spokesman, Mitt Romney campaign aide and Fox News contributor, whose confirmation was long held up by congressional critics over his history of provocative tweets, including several derogatory of the appearance of prominent women. But ambassadors do not represent a president; they represent a state, and they are not supposed to go around “empowering” nationalist movements or far-right ideologies in other countries. The Germans were furious. The new ambassador is behaving “not like a diplomat, but like a far-right colonial officer,” fumed Martin Schulz, the former European Parliament president. In true Trumpian fashion, Mr. Grenell insisted he had been misinterpreted. “Don’t put words in my mouth,” he tweeted. “The idea that I’d endorse candidates/parties is ridiculous. I stand by my comments that we are experiencing an awakening from the silent majority — those who reject the elites & their bubble. Led by Trump.” "
235,"Good Wednesday. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.) Here’s what we’re watching: • The odds of Athenahealth getting sold just got much higher. • Alexander Nix, the former Cambridge Analytica C.E.O., just got grilled by British lawmakers. • Google’s annual shareholder meeting, where the company’s workplace diversity efforts will come under scrutiny. • ZTE’s rescue may come soon, but what will the U.S. get in return? • The Disney-Comcast battle comes to Britain. Margrethe Vestager, the E.U.’s antitrust chief, has made it clear that Europe will be one of the tech industry’s biggest regulators. The FT’s reported that her commission plans to fine Google over the dominance of its Android mobile operating system, underscoring that point yet again. More from Rochelle Toplensky of the FT: The issue with Android As the FT notes, this penalty could have big ramifications for Google. Its Android operating system dominated smartphone market worldwide because Google gave it away for free. But Ms. Vestager has been looking into whether the Silicon Valley behemoth improperly forced phone makers to favor services like Chrome and Google search, as well as stopping others from developing competing operating systems using the open-source parts of Android. The bigger picture Google has been in the sights of the E.U. for some time. Last year, Ms. Vestager’s commission levied a record $2.7 billion fine over the company’s shopping comparison service. That didn’t do much to dent Google’s core businesses, but the Android case might be a different matter. "
236,"The battle for control of Congress was front and center on Tuesday night, with races taking shape in several intensely contested House seats in California and New Jersey. But there were revealing elections in the Midwest and the South, too, underscoring President Trump’s power in the Republican Party and the different ways Democrats hope to loosen his hold on red-state America. Here are some of our takeaways: National Democrats spent over $7 million in an effort to ensure they had a candidate reach the general election in three House districts in California held by Republicans. Their decision to not take their chances in the state’s “top two” system — in which the top finishers in nonpartisan, open primaries face each other in November — appears to have been a wise investment. The party’s intervention in the districts held by Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Ed Royce and Darrell Issa, all Republicans, paid off: they angered some of their own activists but were virtually certain to advance candidates in each of the three districts, including their preferred picks against Mr. Rohrabacher and in Mr. Royce’s seat. And the Democrats also got a bit of a lesson about the risks of not intervening, in the race for the seat held by Representative Jeff Denham. The Democrat Josh Harder got little outside help and appeared poised to barely edge out a little-known Republican challenger because the other five Democrats split more than 30 percent of the vote. It did not come cheap, but if Democrats secure a narrow House majority in November they will have done so in part because they decided to aggressively compete in June.

237,"WASHINGTON — Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has temporarily halted relieving the debt of some student borrowers who were defrauded by the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges, after a federal judge found her department misused earnings data to calculate loan forgiveness. In response to a court order last week, the Education Department said that it would grant a temporary postponement of loan payments for Corinthian students in lieu of federal debt-relief claims. It also said it would stop collection payments for four students who sued the department over its new formula for determining how much debt they would have to repay. The halt came after Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim of Federal District Court in San Francisco found that the department had violated the Privacy Act by sharing student borrower information, such as Social Security numbers and birth dates, with the Social Security Administration to obtain earnings data. The judge ordered the Education Department to end the practice and its collection of Corinthian student debts. In December, Ms. DeVos announced a new system to manage the thousands of students who filed so-called borrower-defense claims after several for-profit colleges began imploding in scandal in 2015, leaving students saddled with debt and tarnished degrees. The department began dividing borrowers according to a tiered system of debt relief, based on whether they had gone on to find gainful employment. Judge Kim’s ruling resulted from a class-action lawsuit filed by the Project on Predatory Student Lending of the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School and the group Housing and Economic Rights Advocates, which challenged Ms. DeVos’s partial-relief system shortly after it was announced. They argued that the new policy was arbitrary, capricious and illegal. While the plaintiffs cheered the judge’s order, they maintained that the department has already illegally granted only partial relief to thousands of students and has left thousands more in limbo. Another hearing is scheduled for next week to determine whether the department will be required to grant full relief to all students. "
238,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. There has been rising anxiety among Democrats in recent weeks — and rising optimism among Republicans — about the midterm elections in November. Last night’s primaries in several states should cause everyone to take a deep breath. The Democrats had a good night: • We still don’t have the full picture, but the trends in voter turnout continue to look strong for Democrats. (The partisan breakdown in primary turnout is a meaningful predictor of general-election results.) In three New Jersey House districts that Democrats are hoping to flip, for example, Democrats cast between 52 percent and 54 percent of primary votes last night. “Should be careful about reading too much into it,” G. Elliott Morris of The Economist said on Twitter, “but those numbers should make Democrats feel good about November.” Democratic turnout was also strong in Iowa. And as analysts dig into the California results today, I’ll be watching for what they find out about turnout. Nate Cohn of The Times has a good explainer of California’s importance here. • Democrats appear to have avoided a disaster scenario in California. They were not locked out of the general election in any congressional district, based on the latest vote counts. The lockout scenario was possible because California has moved to a “top two” primary system. It no longer has party primaries; all candidates instead run in a single primary. In some districts, so many Democrats were running that it seemed possible that Republicans could finish in the top two spots, even if both received only around 20 percent of the vote. "
239,"A prominent far-right leader who dismissed the Nazi era as mere bird poop on Germany’s 1,000-year history was swimming in a lake near his house one evening recently, when a man on the shore grabbed his clothes. The thief’s parting words: “Nazis don’t need bathing fun!” By the time the far-right politician, Alexander Gauland, a co-leader of the Alternative for Germany party, known as AfD, made it out of the water, the man had made off with the bundle and someone had already called the police. The episode unleashed plenty of schadenfreude, and some criticism, on social media. Images of a dripping Mr. Gauland being escorted back to his house while wearing only a colorful pair of patterned swimming shorts spread rapidly, and a hashtag was born: #bathingfun. Mr. Gauland told the Märkische Allgemeine, a local newspaper based in his hometown, Potsdam, which first reported the theft on Tuesday, “My belongings were stolen by someone as I was in the water, and other swimmers called the police without asking me.” It was the second time in less than a week that Mr. Gauland, 77, had made the national news. Over the weekend, while addressing a gathering of his party’s youth movement in the eastern state of Thuringia, he made that comment about the Nazi era, which drew widespread condemnation as belittling the Holocaust. After the bathing episode, which happened last week but was reported only recently, social media users had a field day. “1,000 years of dignity in one image,” read one post on Twitter. “Creative way to resist the far right in Germany,” read another.

240,"The Popcast is hosted by Jon Caramanica, a pop music critic for The New York Times. It covers the latest in pop music criticism, trends and news. Seven songs, less than 24 minutes and no shortage of emotional baggage — welcome to “Ye.” The new album by Kanye West, released on Friday, was bound to be polarizing, given the rocky few weeks in the life of the rapper. (Declaring a kinship with Donald J. Trump’s “dragon energy” was only the beginning.) And yet upon its landing — first via scenic live stream from Wyoming and then through more traditional channels — the album still managed to shock with its immediacy, its rough edges, its moments of serenity and its lack of concrete answers. Always a proud and determined provocateur, the rapper-slash-producer-slash-designer “whipsaws between grandiosity and anxiety” on his eighth solo LP, Jon Pareles wrote in his review, “though Mr. West’s self-regard easily prevails.” Political content, it turns out, is all but absent, while family drama is at the forefront. To parse the flashes of vulnerability amid the ego, this week’s Popcast attempts to close-read not just the music, but the celebrity circus around it, which could not help but affect the album’s reception. Joining Mr. Pareles, the chief pop critic of The New York Times, is Mr. Caramanica, who attended the Wyoming listening event and after-party (“both surreal and also deeply unremarkable”), along with The Times’ pop music reporter Joe Coscarelli.

241,"WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan contradicted President Trump’s assertions of a broad conspiracy by federal law enforcement on Wednesday, joining other lawmakers in saying that the F.B.I. did nothing wrong by using a confidential informant to contact members of the Trump campaign as it investigated its ties to Russia. And he said that Mr. Trump should not try to pardon himself, despite the president’s assertion two days earlier that he has the power to take such a step. “I don’t know the technical answer to that question, but I think obviously the answer is he shouldn’t,” Mr. Ryan told reporters. “And no one is above the law.” Mr. Ryan’s warning was the latest indication that the president is beginning to face trouble on Capitol Hill, where members of his own party are showing small signs of resistance. From international trade and China to immigration and the conduct of his cabinet, serious dissent from at least some Republicans is beginning to boil over. At the forefront is an effort by Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania to try to attach legislation to a must-pass defense policy bill that would require Mr. Trump to petition Congress for approval to impose national security tariffs, like those the White House has imposed on steel and aluminum produced in Canada, Mexico and Europe. More than a half-dozen Republican senators have signed on to the amendment, and a small group of Republicans decamped Wednesday to the White House to try to navigate tensions with a protectionist president who has drastically departed from his party’s traditional embrace of free markets. "
242,"SAN FRANCISCO — In this deeply liberal California city, frustration over crises around housing and homelessness is bringing some on the left a little further right. At an upscale sushi restaurant, a few dozen members of the San Francisco Republican Party gathered on Tuesday night to watch the election results. Most did not want to talk about state or national politics, they wanted to keep it local. The group largely supported the Republican candidate for governor, John H. Cox, whom President Trump had endorsed and who won a place on the ballot along with Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and a former San Francisco mayor. But among the longtime Republicans were some newcomers, drawn to the right over frustration with the city’s trifecta of very tangible crises: a large homeless population, record housing costs and a high rate of property crime. “We’re the most beautiful city no one ever wants to come back to,” said Anna Coles, 36, a real estate agent who has lived in the city for 12 years. Ms. Coles has seen a surprising resurgence of conservative politics this year on Nextdoor, a website that creates private neighborhood-specific social networks. “I mean, I see people post these long diatribes about the petty crime and homelessness,” Ms. Coles said. “Folks are realizing they can’t vote along party lines anymore.” "
243,"BRUSSELS — In a letter to senior Trump administration officials, European foreign and finance leaders this week tacitly acknowledged that their efforts to preserve the West’s nuclear deal with Iran were failing. In the letter, sent on Monday to the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the European leaders cited “security interests” in requesting that companies in Europe be granted an exemption from United States sanctions that would be imposed as a result of President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the pact. “In their current state, U.S. secondary sanctions could prevent the European Union from continuing meaningful sanctions relief to Iran,” said the letter, signed by the finance and foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany, all signatories to the 2015 accord with Tehran, and by Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s foreign-policy chief, who oversaw the negotiations. Without that sanctions relief, Iran has threatened to pull out of the deal. That “would further unsettle a region where additional conflicts would be disastrous,” the ministers argue, asserting that the deal was “the best means through which we can prevent a nuclear-armed Iran,” and that there appeared to be “no credible alternatives at this time.” The letter was reported on Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal and was then obtained by The New York Times. The plea is considered unlikely to produce the relief the Europeans want, since the Trump administration’s stated intention is to pressure Tehran into agreeing to an entirely new set of negotiations that would encompass its ballistic missile program and its support for hard-line regimes and militias throughout the Middle East. "
244,"PHILADELPHIA — This is a metro area of diverse factions, from the South Philadelphia union Democrats to blue-blood Main Line Republicans. We argue about everything. What we never disagree on is religion. Because all Philadelphians practice the same faith. We all worship the N.F.L. champion Eagles. So when President Trump rescinded his Rose Garden invitation to the team this week and took verbal shots at our favorite sons, Eagles fans of all political divisions had the same response. We pulled on our Super Bowl LII ball caps, watched the “Philly Special” highlight video one more time and ran outside for a quick neighborhood “E-A-G-L-E-S” chant. We know better. Because we know what this group of players is about. The president labeled the Eagles unpatriotic because they do not conform to his view of the national anthem. His press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, accused the team of pulling “a political stunt” because many players declined the White House invitation. “The vast majority of the Eagles team decided to abandon their fans,” she said. Hardly. Since the start of the 2017 season, this group of young men has done nothing but embrace its fans, its community and oh, by the way, the Vince Lombardi Trophy. No one feels abandoned. I’ve covered sports in Philadelphia for more than three decades. Never have I seen a group of players more dedicated to one another, their fans and the city in which they play: Safety Malcolm Jenkins, perhaps the most visible leader in the players’ protest against racial injustice, spends his time off riding along with police officers, visiting prisons and meeting with public defenders and lawmakers. He headed the players’ coalition that prodded owners last December to commit up to $89 million to help grass-roots organizations battle injustice. "
245,"WASHINGTON — After spending nearly a month out of the public eye, Melania Trump emerged from the White House on Wednesday, putting an end to at least a few of the theories — some her husband has repeated to his 52 million Twitter followers — that blossomed like swampland ragweed during her time in seclusion. Dressed in a trench coat and heels, the first lady accompanied President Trump to the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to attend a briefing on the coming hurricane season. Sitting nearly still, Mrs. Trump cut a totemic figure alongside Mr. Trump as they sat around a conference table at the agency’s headquarters. The president, reading from a notecard, introduced “our great first lady” to several members of his cabinet, Vice President Mike Pence and an assembled group of reporters. “She went through a little rough patch, but she’s doing great,” Mr. Trump said, patting his wife on the hand. “The people love you. Thank you, honey.” Mrs. Trump spent five days at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in May to treat what her aides called a benign kidney condition, and had not appeared in public since before entering the hospital. On Twitter Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump bitterly complained about the speculation by the public and some journalists about her absence. But in attacking what he said were several conspiracy theories the news media had generated about his wife’s absence, he ended up repeating the kind of unfounded rumors about his wife that would normally attract legal action from him and his notoriously litigious family. "
246,"WASHINGTON — President Trump commuted the sentence on Wednesday of a 63-year-old woman serving life in prison for a nonviolent drug conviction after her case was brought to his attention by the reality television star Kim Kardashian West. Although short of a full pardon, the decision will free Alice Marie Johnson, who has been locked up in federal prison in Alabama since 1996 on charges related to cocaine distribution and money laundering. Ms. Kardashian West, who learned of the case through a video that went viral on social media, visited Mr. Trump at the White House last week to lobby on Ms. Johnson’s behalf. “While this administration will always be very tough on crime, it believes that those who have paid their debt to society and worked hard to better themselves while in prison deserve a second chance,” the White House said in a statement announcing the commutation. Ms. Kardashian West celebrated the decision on Twitter. “BEST NEWS EVER!!!!” she wrote. In an emailed statement, she thanked Mr. Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, for showing mercy to Ms. Johnson. “Her commutation and forthcoming release is inspirational and gives hope to so many others who are also deserving of a second chance,” Ms. Kardashian West said. The president’s intervention was contrary to the policies his own Justice Department has enacted since he took office. Attorney General Jeff Sessions last year ordered federal prosecutors to pursue the toughest possible charges and sentences against criminal defendants, reversing President Barack Obama’s efforts to ease penalties in nonviolent drug cases. The arguments advanced on Ms. Johnson’s behalf were essentially the same that were made for thousands of other nonviolent drug convicts whose petitions for presidential clemency have been languishing at the Justice Department without action. While Mr. Obama pardoned 212 people and commuted the sentences of 1,715 prisoners, including 568 serving life sentences, Mr. Trump has acted mainly on a few high-profile cases brought to him by associates and allies. "
247,"SEOUL, South Korea — He ordered his uncle executed and half brother assassinated. He spent millions developing and testing a hydrogen bomb and intercontinental ballistic missiles as his people suffered severe food shortages. He exchanged threats of nuclear annihilation with President Trump, calling the American leader a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.” That was last year’s image. In more recent months, North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has achieved one of the most striking transformations in modern diplomacy. The man described by critics as a murderous dictator and nuclear lunatic has held hands and had heart-to-heart talks with South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, who has encouraged and abetted Mr. Kim’s makeover. Mr. Kim has enticed South Korea and the United States into negotiations by dangling the possibility of denuclearizing his country. His popularity has surged in polls in South Korea as he prepares to become the first North Korean leader to meet a sitting American president. With a dazzle of diplomatic initiatives in the run-up to his historic June 12 summit meeting with Mr. Trump in Singapore, Mr. Kim has effectively redefined himself. Some South Koreans now see him as more reliable than Mr. Trump despite the decades-long alliance between their country and the United States. Mr. Kim’s enhanced standing among South Koreans was crystallized by recent images of him walking in the woods with Mr. Moon, and on a beach with President Xi Jinping of China discussing North Korea’s nuclear program. "
248,"WASHINGTON — Democrats enhanced their prospects for winning control of the House with Tuesday’s coast-to-coast primary results, skirting potential calamity in California and lining up likely gains in New Jersey and possible victories in Iowa and New Mexico. The Democratic Party had feared disaster in California, where a quirky “jungle primary” gives the November ballot to the top two finishers, regardless of party. But Democratic contenders there leveraged financial and strategic help from the national party to weather the winnowing primary, and ensure that they will field candidates in multiple districts that they will most likely need if they are to win control in November. “Even though Democrats had to spend a few million dollars, crisis averted,” said Nathan Gonzales, a veteran House race handicapper and the editor of the Inside Elections newsletter. Republicans avoided their own worst-case scenario as well, securing a spot in the California governor’s race, which should help bring G.O.P. voters to the polls this fall to vote for their party’s House candidates. Republicans missed a slot on the ballot to challenge Senator Dianne Feinstein’s re-election bid, but a shutout in both California’s Senate race and its contest for governor could have severely depressed conservative turnout. Republican voters also chose strong candidates in Southern California for the showdown in November. The Democrats had more on the line, and more to celebrate. They will be able to mount challenges in places where the party feared being shut out, including open seats near San Diego and Los Angeles and districts represented by Republican incumbents in Orange County, Los Angeles County and around Modesto. Between California and New Jersey, Democrats will contend for at least 10 Republican-held seats, nearly half of the 23 they need for control. While California was the focal point of Tuesday’s voting, New Jersey was one of a handful of other states where the battle for the House was also joined, including Iowa and New Mexico. "
249,"BRUSSELS — This week leaders from the G-7 countries will meet in Canada to discuss some of the key problems facing the world today. The agenda of the conference is guided by themes like gender equality, preparing for jobs of the future and foreign threats to our democracies. But there is no hiding that our talks will be held in the specific political context of President Trump’s recent decisions and the reactions they have provoked on both sides of the Atlantic. By which I mean the United States’ withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal, and the new tariffs on steel and aluminum, including the way they were imposed and the arguments used to justify them. To me, an incurable pro-American European fanatically devoted to the idea of trans-Atlantic cooperation, these decisions are unfortunate and worrying. The crucial question today is whether these decisions are only incidental changes to current American policy (to which, of course, every president is entitled) or the beginning of a new strategic trend. Simply put: Are they merely seasonal turbulences or rather the first symptoms of the breakup of the Western political community, which the G-7 represents and informally leads? It’s inevitable that this will be on everyone’s mind at the conference, given the signals that Washington may not be interested in reconfirming our shared commitment to the rules-based international order as one of the main aims of our group. This is no laughing matter. The alternative to order is disorder. When I hosted Vice President Mike Pence and, subsequently, President Trump in Brussels last year, I expressed my belief that it is in the West’s interest to maintain a rules-based international order in which brute force and egoism do not determine everything. That rules-based order can be enforced only by a common, mutually supportive and decisive policy of the whole Western community. For millions of people worldwide, the West’s predictability and stability guarantee or, at the very least, offer hope that chaos, violence and arrogance will not triumph. Whoever wants to demolish this order must know that we will stay united in its defense. I will make this case to the other participants of the G-7 conference. After all, our community cannot be blown apart by aluminum tariffs. The essence of cooperation within the G-7 is the de facto protection of the free world against those who disrespect our shared fundamental values: freedom and dignity of the individual, equal rights for people and nations, and fair rules. This is what led us to exclude Russia from our group after its attack on Ukraine. The effectiveness of our action has always been directly proportional to our solidarity. It will be worth bearing this in mind when we meet in Canada and discuss foreign threats to our democracies. But even more important will be the spirit of our debate and, I hope, our shared belief that only united are we capable of protecting the free world. "
250,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Welcome to a special (and sleep-deprived!) edition of California Today. The nation’s eyes were on our state Tuesday, and for good reason. California may be the most important battleground for Democrats in their drive to claim a majority in Congress. But Democrats have been nervous because of California’s “top two” election system, which they have worried might shut them out from the November ballot in some pivotal races. As of early this morning, California was living up to its reputation for being notoriously slow at vote counting, and a lot remains to be seen. Still, here’s a look at what we know so far: • Our reporters put together this story, which rounds up everything that happened on Tuesday. At the top of the ticket, Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor and former mayor of San Francisco, captured one of two spots on the November ballot. The other went to John Cox, a Republican business executive. That left Antonio R. Villaraigosa, a Democrat and former Los Angeles mayor, out of the mix. • Mr. Cox’s showing represented a major tactical victory for national Republicans as they seek to protect seven seats in California that Democrats are targeting. If Democrats win each of those seats, the gains would amount to nearly a third of the 23 seats they need over all to flip the House. • We’ve been compiling live results here. (And the votes are still coming in.) • And here is our live briefing that will catch you up to speed if you haven’t been paying much attention to all this primary hubbub. "
251,"WASHINGTON — Two top aides resigned Wednesday from the Environmental Protection Agency as its administrator, Scott Pruitt, faced mounting allegations of misusing his authority, including by seeking a Chick-fil-A fast-food franchise for his wife. Millan Hupp, Mr. Pruitt’s scheduler, and Sarah Greenwalt, a senior counsel to the administrator, have come under scrutiny in recent weeks in connection with Mr. Pruitt’s spending and ethics concerns. Before joining the agency, both Ms. Hupp and Ms. Greenwalt worked for Mr. Pruitt in Oklahoma, where he served as attorney general. Both aides later received substantial raises at the E.P.A., bypassing the usual White House procedures. Mr. Pruitt told Congress he neither knew about nor approved of the raises, and he told lawmakers he reversed the raises when he learned about them. The departures come as Mr. Pruitt faces fresh questions about his management decisions. On Monday, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, which is conducting one of 12 investigations into his spending and ties to lobbyists, released a partial transcript of an interview with Ms. Hupp showing that Mr. Pruitt asked her to do personal errands for him, including apartment hunting and asking the Trump International Hotel if Mr. Pruitt could purchase a used mattress. Emails obtained under public records laws also showed that Mr. Pruitt had asked Sydney Hupp, Ms. Hupp’s sister and the administrator’s former scheduler, to facilitate a meeting with the chief executive of Chick-fil-A regarding a “potential business opportunity.” That turned out to be a possible franchise for Mr. Pruitt’s wife, Marlyn. In an interview with the Nexstar Media Group on Wednesday Mr. Pruitt defended the effort, which was first reported by The Washington Post. He also praised the Chick-fil-A chain. "
252,"Of course Donald Trump is corrupt. Everyone with any sense knew he would be, although the scale of his personal profiteering, the strong likelihood that his family’s financial interests have distorted U.S. foreign and national security policy, have startled even the cynics. And, of course, the example set by the grifter in chief has infected his whole administration. But what’s really striking to me is not so much the extent of corruption among Trump officials as its pettiness. And that pettiness itself tells you a lot about the kind of people now running America. Corrupt cabinet members used to look like Albert Fall, Warren Harding’s secretary of the interior, who was at the center of the Teapot Dome scandal. Fall used his office to secure sweetheart leasing deals for two oil companies, and in return received more than $400,000 in bribes — well over $5 million in today’s prices. That’s the kind of corruption you can understand and sort of respect. Corrupt Trump officials, by contrast, look like Tom Price, who managed to lose his job as secretary of health and human services by taking too many private planes at public expense; Ryan Zinke, who holds Fall’s old job at Interior and has a problem similar to Price’s but with helicopters and a general habit of using public funds to pay for private travel; Ben Carson of Housing and Urban Development, with his $31,000 dining set; and Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, who likes taking military jets, sometimes on what appear to be private vacations. And then there’s the prince of perks: Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, whose list of petty grifts includes everything from customized fountain pens, to telling an aide to procure a used mattress, to an attempt to use his office to secure a Chick-fil-A franchise for his wife. One thing that immediately strikes me about these stories is that all these officials are failing the marshmallow test — the famous if controversial psychological experiment in which children are told they can get two marshmallows if they can wait a few minutes before eating the one in front of them.

253,"SEOUL, South Korea — Satellite imagery indicates that North Korea is razing some facilities used for testing one of its most dangerous missiles after its leader, Kim Jong-un, announced a moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests, according to an analysis released this week. A “key missile test stand” that was used for testing missile ejections from canisters was demolished at a test site near Kusong in North Korea’s northwest, Joseph S. Bermudez Jr., an expert on the country’s weapons systems, said in a report published Wednesday on the website 38 North. The Kusong test site was being closely monitored by missile experts because North Korea launched its first solid-fuel midrange ballistic missile, known as Pukguksong-2, from there in February last year. Besides its intercontinental ballistic missiles, solid-fuel missiles have been among the most worrisome additions to North Korea’s growing arsenal of ballistic missiles. They can be launched faster and are easier to transport and hide, making them more suitable for surprise attacks. Work to raze the missile test stand and nearby support structures began in the second week of May and appeared nearly complete in satellite imagery taken on May 19, Mr. Bermudez said. He said the stand was the only known facility in North Korea used for land-based, canister-launched ballistic missile ejection tests, which are critical for developing the solid-propellant Pukguksong-2 or longer-range systems. Militaries use canisters to “cold launch” missiles, ejecting them high into the air before their fuel ignites. The North’s Pukguksong series are cold launch missiles. "
254,"Few political donors are as influential, yet little known, as Liz and Dick Uihlein. The Midwestern couple has joined the upper pantheon of Republican donors alongside names like Koch, Mercer and Adelson. They have spent roughly $26 million on the current election cycle, supporting more than 60 congressional candidates, working outside the party establishment to advance a combative, hard-right conservatism, from Washington to the smallest town. Mr. Uihlein (pronounced YOU-line), a scion of one of the founders of Schlitz beer, underwrites firebrand anti-establishment candidates who typically defend broad access to assault weapons and assail transgender rights. He has also bankrolled partisan newspapers and backed Roy Moore in Alabama even after he was accused of sexual misconduct with underage girls. Mrs. Uihlein is the hands-on president of Uline, the packing supply giant the couple founded together nearly four decades ago. Her own views emerge in dispatches she sends out in the company catalog: about her devotion to Fox News, her love for Hall & Oates — they once performed at Uline — and her disdain for marijuana. “Have the politicians gone mad?” she once wrote about the legalization of the drug. “It’s bad news.” Perhaps nothing illustrates the couple’s determination to set the agenda more than their efforts in the Wisconsin town of Manitowish Waters. They have spent millions remaking the small community and buying up much of its downtown. In 2016, shortly before Mrs. Uihlein joined the Trump campaign as a major fund-raiser, she threatened to divert $300,000 in planned donations if the town didn’t move a boat ramp that was near a pavilion she had built. “I find this delay unnecessary and unacceptable,” she wrote to a local official, in an email with the subject line, “The Derailment of What is Best for Manitowish Waters.” “I need an answer now,” she added. “I am done waiting.” Married for 51 years, both in their 70s, the Uihleins rarely grant interviews. But in a statement responding to questions provided by The Times, the couple said,“We care about our community and our country and choose to personally support candidates that share our policy beliefs.” "
255,"WASHINGTON — President Trump will skip most of the second day of a summit meeting with allies this weekend, the White House said late Thursday, as he engaged in a contentious war of words over trade on the eve of a gathering that will underscore his isolation from the leaders of the world’s largest economies. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, announced that Mr. Trump will leave Canada at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, well before scheduled sessions on climate change, clean energy and oceans. He will attend an early-morning session on “women’s empowerment,” but he will be gone before any joint statement is issued by the other leaders. Earlier Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada lashed out at Mr. Trump for imposing tariffs on their steel and aluminum industries. They called it an illegal economic assault on their countries that is unanimously opposed by the other leaders of the Group of 7 who will gather Friday in a sleepy village in Quebec for their annual summit meeting. “The American President may not mind being isolated, but neither do we mind signing a 6 country agreement if need be,” Mr. Macron said Thursday in an especially acerbic tweet. “Because these 6 countries represent values, they represent an economic market which has the weight of history behind it and which is now a true international force.” Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference with Mr. Macron that “we are going to defend our industries and our workers” and “show the U.S. president that his unacceptable actions are hurting his own citizens.” Mr. Trump responded with his trademark Twitter bluntness a few hours later, signaling that he has no intention of relenting on his aggressive trade demands and cares little about the diplomatic niceties that usually constrain public disagreements between the leaders of friendly nations. "
256,"WASHINGTON — A White House economic analysis of President Trump’s trade agenda has concluded that Mr. Trump’s tariffs will hurt economic growth in the United States, according to several people familiar with the research. The findings from the White House Council of Economic Advisers have been circulated only internally and not publicly released, as is often the case with the council’s work, making the exact economic projections unknown. But the determination comes as top White House officials continue to insist publicly that Mr. Trump’s trade approach will be “massively good for the U.S. economy.” The chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, an economist who came to the administration from the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, dodged questions at a White House briefing on Tuesday about whether tariffs would hurt an economy that has accelerated during Mr. Trump’s tenure. Asked whether the administration’s economists had modeled the impact that a trade war with China would have on the United States economy, Mr. Hassett said Mr. Trump was a great negotiator who would persuade other countries to open their markets to American products. “If you model a future where everybody else reduces their trade barriers to ours, then that’s massively good for the global economy and massively good for the U.S. economy,” Mr. Hassett said. But the immediate effect of the administration’s trade agenda has been the opposite, as other nations retaliate against the United States with their own tariffs. "
257,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration, after heavy lobbying by the chemical industry, is scaling back the way the federal government determines health and safety risks associated with the most dangerous chemicals on the market, documents from the Environmental Protection Agency show. Under a law passed by Congress during the final year of the Obama administration, the E.P.A. was required for the first time to evaluate hundreds of potentially toxic chemicals and determine if they should face new restrictions, or even be removed from the market. The chemicals include many in everyday use, such as dry-cleaning solvents, paint strippers and substances used in health and beauty products like shampoos and cosmetics. But as it moves forward reviewing the first batch of 10 chemicals, the E.P.A. has in most cases decided to exclude from its calculations any potential exposure caused by the substances’ presence in the air, the ground or water, according to more than 1,500 pages of documents released last week by the agency. Instead, the agency will focus on possible harm caused by direct contact with a chemical in the workplace or elsewhere. The approach means that the improper disposal of chemicals — leading to the contamination of drinking water, for instance — will often not be a factor in deciding whether to restrict or ban them. The approach is a big victory for the chemical industry, which has repeatedly pressed the E.P.A. to narrow the scope of its risk evaluations. Nancy B. Beck, the Trump administration’s appointee to help oversee the E.P.A.’s toxic chemical unit, previously worked as an executive at the American Chemistry Council, one of the industry’s main lobbying groups. A spokesman for the E.P.A. said that the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and other laws already provided the agency with the authority to regulate chemicals found in the air, rivers and drinking water, so there was no need to revisit them under the 2016 law, which updated the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976.

258,"To the Editor: Re “How to Repair the National Marriage” (column, June 5): I find it insulting that David Brooks likens our political crisis to a bad marriage while our democracy unravels. These are not two political parties seeking to be understood by each other. This is not a dispute that can be resolved by good manners. The Republican Party does not want to recommit to a bipartisan ideal; Republicans are quite content to ignore President Trump’s outrageous behavior and to sacrifice the integrity of our democratic institutions to plow through their agenda. How can Mr. Brooks waste his intellect on this useless metaphor? Why is he not outraged? BEVERLY WOYTOWICH, BROOKLYN "
259,"For all his bluster about trade wars, President Trump seems willing to push China only so far: Witness the deal on Thursday to grant Chinese telecom giant ZTE a reprieve from harsh American penalties. The reason is likely to lead straight to Iowa soybean and corn farmers like Benjamin Schmidt. Mr. Schmidt’s forebears have farmed the same land outside Iowa City for nearly 150 years. He and his father together till about 2,500 acres of the fertile prairie that stretches from Ohio through Nebraska. When I reached him last week, he was on his tractor, spreading fertilizer on this year’s corn crop. Apart from the weather, hardly any issue looms larger for farmers than the prospect of retaliatory tariffs against American agriculture products. China has threatened a 25 percent tariff on soybeans and has already sharply curtailed purchases from the United States. This week Mexico imposed a 20 percent tariff on pork. The European Union and Canada have said they, too, will slap tariffs on a variety of American agricultural products. “China is our most important export market for soybeans,” Mr. Schmidt said. “When your most important customer hits you with tariffs, there are going to be serious ramifications. My first reaction was this is going to hit us pretty hard.” Grant Kimberley, who with his father farms 4,000 acres near Maxwell, Iowa, and is director of market development for the Iowa Soybean Association, was even more emphatic: “We want to sell to China, Mexico, whoever. We should be part of the solution, which is bringing down the trade imbalance.” American farmers may be dwindling in absolute numbers, but they wield outsize influence in the raging war between protectionists and free traders in the Trump White House. That’s because of both the importance of their occupation to the balance of trade — United States agricultural exports have averaged nearly $140 billion a year since 2010 — and their geographical concentration in states that were critical to Mr. Trump’s 2016 electoral majority. "
260,"To the Editor: I have been reading with an increasingly heavy heart news articles about the Trump administration’s separation of children from their parents at the border. But I was stopped cold by a quote in Nicholas Kristof’s column “ ‘My Babies Started Crying’ as ICE Took Them Away” (May 31): “White House Chief of Staff John Kelly hails family separation as a ‘tough deterrent’ and shrugs that ‘the children will be taken care of — put into foster care or whatever.’ ” “Or whatever” — that most dismissive phrase! So, it has come to this: We have weaponized the callous traumatization of children in the name of the promised immigration reform. Children have become acceptable collateral damage in a policy war. Are there no parents in this administration? Are there no parents in the Border Patrol? Are there no Trump supporters who are parents? How can anyone who has children justify this? ANITA MORAN, SAN FRANCISCO To the Editor: Reacting to the separation of immigrant children from their parents at our border, it is important to emphasize the subject of the lifelong trauma suffered by these children. The Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth, with the National Foster Youth Institute, was recently host to more than a hundred former foster youths in Washington. We heard directly from participants who were separated from their parents at a young age. "
261,"PARIS — In a book just published, “The World As It Is,” Barack Obama’s former deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, tells of a tear in Angela Merkel’s eye as she bade farewell to the departing American president for the final time in Berlin on Nov. 17, 2016. Nine days earlier, the election of his successor, Donald J. Trump, had shaken the world. Nowhere had the tremor been felt deeper than in Europe; the German chancellor told Mr. Obama that she saw it as her duty to run for a fourth term because of Mr. Trump. “She’s all alone,” Mr. Obama noted. Someone had to take on the mantle and defend the liberal international order. Chancellor Merkel ran, barely won and spent the next six months negotiating a governing coalition. In the meantime, in France, Emmanuel Macron won a stunning victory against his far-right opponent, Marine Le Pen. Last month, as President Macron was about to fly to St. Petersburg to meet President Vladimir V. Putin, I asked a Russian diplomat how the French head of state would be perceived in Russia. “As the leader of the Western world,” he replied. Having apparently given up on an American administration they have learned not to trust because of its leader’s unpredictability and the checks, balances and investigations that limit him, the Russians are putting their scorn of Europeans on hold in hopes of finding someone more reliable to talk to. That the “Western world” still exists in the eyes of the Russians is certainly reassuring, since the very existence of the West is now being questioned within the trans-Atlantic community. When the leaders of the G-7 countries (United States, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Japan) gather in Quebec on Friday for their annual meeting, it will be no love feast. Already having shrunk from G-8 after Russia was excluded following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, the group was described last week as the “G-6+1” by Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, as he and other European ministers were angrily confronting the American Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, over President Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. But don’t bet on the “G-6” to spearhead a united assault to defend the free world. Italy is now also led by populists and Britain is absorbed in deep soul-searching as it severs its links with the European Union. At a security summit on Asia last week, Singapore’s defense minister, Ng Eng Hen, declined to call Britain “a European power.” “I don’t know what you are now,” he added, perplexed. Welcome to the world of 2018, when we celebrate the centenary of the end of World War I and indulge in nostalgic reminiscence of the popular upheavals of 1968, 50 years ago, while our current international order is in disarray. This may well end up as the year of the awakening of Europe. We will have one man to thank for opening our eyes: Donald J. Trump. "
262,"In the spring of 2010, Christopher Steele, a former British spy with a shock of graying hair and a quiet, understated manner, received some alarming news: Vladimir Putin, a lifelong ice hockey fan, had taken a sudden interest in soccer. This was years before Mr. Steele compiled his now famous dossier on Donald Trump, with its references to clandestine meetings in Prague and, of course, “the pee tape.” In 2010, Mr. Steele, regarded among those who knew him as a serious and levelheaded MI6 officer, had only recently retired and opened his private intelligence firm in London. He might have reasonably expected to be embarking on an uneventful, if lucrative, second career. But the story of what happened next would profoundly affect his and countless others’ lives, foreshadowing the Trump investigation and the shadowy role Russia plays in the modern world. Among Mr. Steele’s first clients was a group of wealthy individuals and corporations supporting England’s bid to host the 2018 World Cup. The tournament hadn’t been held in England since 1966, and the country’s soccer-mad populace was desperate to do so again. England invented the modern-day game in the 19th century and, at the outset of the 21st, believed it was uniquely poised to host, with dozens of world-class stadiums, hotels, highways and airports ready. The British government chipped in £2.1 million of the bid’s more than £17 million total cost, and international celebrities including Prince William, David Beckham and David Cameron, then the prime minister, promoted the effort. Mr. Steele had been hired, in large part, because of his expertise in Russia, one of six countries vying for the right to host the tournament. In the early 1990s, he had worked undercover in Moscow, and he maintained extensive contacts in Russian government and business circles. His mandate in the spring of 2010 was to find out anything he could about the competing bid. He was no stranger to Russia’s playbook. When it came to pursuing national objectives, the country had few if any compunctions about employing whatever means — collusive, corrupting, scandalous — might be necessary. And on its face, it was clear the Russian bid was going to need a lot of help. In stark contrast to England, Russia appeared profoundly unqualified to host a monthlong tournament expected to draw well over three million spectators. For starters, Russia didn’t have a great soccer tradition; its team hadn’t even qualified to play in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, thanks to an embarrassing loss to Slovenia. More important, it didn’t have adequate stadiums or other infrastructure, and since it was already going to host the 2014 Winter Olympics, there were serious questions about how it could afford to build what was required.  The International Federation of Association Football, or FIFA, the Swiss-based nonprofit that runs the World Cup and oversees world soccer, ultimately rated Russia’s bid riskiest for operational considerations among other contestants for the 2018 tournament. To most observers, Russia didn’t seem like a serious threat to England’s hopes, but Mr. Steele’s confidential sources told a very different story. Mr. Putin, then serving a four-year term as prime minister, saw hosting the World Cup as a vital way to project his country’s power, and his own, around the world. He was determined, sources said, to win the bid at any cost. "
263,"TRENTON — New Jersey moved one step closer on Thursday to making it easier for gamblers to be separated from their money. The State Legislature voted to legalize sports betting, paving the way for casinos and racetracks to take wages and providing the state with a new source of revenue. It is likely a matter of days now before cash can start changing hands at casinos in Atlantic City and at Monmouth Park Racetrack near the Jersey Shore and perhaps take advantage of the global interest in the World Cup, which begins next week, or the National Basketball Association finals. The last remaining hurdle is the signature of Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, who supports sports betting but has not said publicly when he would sign the bill into law. The bill’s passage represents a capstone to the more than six-year effort to bring sports betting to New Jersey and helps spur interest in and provide a financial boost to the struggling casino and horse racing industries. Last month, the United States Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal law that had prohibited commercial sports betting in most states. Although Delaware beat New Jersey in opening the betting window, allowing gambling to begin Tuesday, New Jersey is the first state to officially make wagering legal in a state where it had been prohibited since the Supreme Court’s decision. Delaware had been grandfathered in for select betting options. "
264,"Forget policy. Forget ideology. Forget hating Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or Nancy Pelosi. From Indiana to Arizona to Ohio, the name of the game for Republican candidates this primary cycle has been to flaunt their Trump love. And woe unto anyone deemed insufficiently smitten. This week’s primary elections underscored the striking degree to which President Trump has transformed the Republican Party from a political organization into a cult of personality. By contrast, Democrats show signs of taking a more pluralistic approach, fielding candidates who are willing and even eager to break with their national leaders — the House minority leader, Ms. Pelosi, in particular. For Republicans tempted by Trump apostasy, Tuesday’s clearest cautionary tale was that of Representative Martha Roby, an Alabama Republican. Two years ago, Ms. Roby was considered a real comer. But then she got all squeamish about the “Access Hollywood” tape in which Mr. Trump shared some of his more pungent dating tips, and she called on him to leave the race. Unfortunately for Ms. Roby, her district ultimately went for Mr. Trump by 32 percentage points. And although she has been a loyal Trump supporter ever since his win, many voters back home are still sore about her brief heresy. Throughout this primary season, Ms. Roby’s Republican opponents were quick to bring up her 2016 comments, and come Tuesday, the congresswoman failed to win the nomination outright. She’s now facing a runoff next month against former Representative Bobby Bright, who ran ads accusing her of having “turned her back on President Trump when he needed her the most.” (Mr. Bright is the party-switching former Democrat from whom Ms. Roby wrested her House seat in 2010.) On the opposite end of the Trump-impact spectrum is John Cox, a Republican businessman running for governor of California. With registered Republicans down to 25 percent of the Golden State electorate (putting them slightly behind independent voters), the party is as likely to capture the governorship this year as Jeff Sessions is to be the next head of the American Civil Liberties Union. Nonetheless, Republicans needed a candidate at the top of the ticket to increase turnout for all the down-ballot House seats they’re fighting over. With the state’s wacky primary system, in which the top two vote-getters advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation, that was hardly a given. (A longtime senator, Dianne Feinstein, will be facing a fellow Democrat.) But late in the race, Mr. Trump came out strongly for Mr. Cox, tweeting his praises, energizing the troops and propelling him to a solid second place behind Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor. It is, of course, not unusual for presidents to have political coattails — and for the party wandering in the wilderness to show greater openness to new ideas and new kinds of candidates. The Democratic approach may be more a function of default (or desperation) than design, but Ms. Pelosi still deserves props for not seeking to kneecap candidates, like Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, who have said they would not support her as speaker. With a bit of luck, genuine ferment and debate among Democratic candidates and officeholders over the right direction on issues like trade and immigration might result in at least one party oriented around a set of ideas. "
265,"WASHINGTON — President Trump asserted Thursday that his decision to abandon the Iran nuclear deal had already curbed Iran’s aggressive behavior, and he predicted that his hard-nosed tactics would also result in a successful nuclear negotiation with North Korea. Iran, he said, was no longer as adventurous in Syria and Yemen, and had relaxed its ambitions to extend its influence all the way to the Mediterranean Sea. “Iran is not the same country that it was a few months ago,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference, five days before he was scheduled to meet in Singapore with Kim Jong-un of North Korea. “They’re a much, much different group of leaders,” he concluded. Mr. Trump cited no evidence to support his contention. Iran remains firmly under the control of its theocratic government, it continues to support proxy forces across the Middle East, and it just announced plans to increase its capacity to enrich uranium after Mr. Trump’s withdrawal. Still, the president said his willingness to walk away from the Iran deal would set the right tone for his negotiations with Mr. Kim over North Korea’s nuclear program. Mr. Trump pointed out that he had already walked away from the Singapore meeting once — a decision he reversed after 24 hours when the Kim government issued a conciliatory response. “I hope it won’t be necessary to walk because I really believe that Kim Jong-un wants to do something,” Mr. Trump said, standing in the Rose Garden alongside Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. “I believe we’re going to have a terrific success or a modified success.” Depending on the degree of success, the president said, he could foresee inviting Mr. Kim to a follow-up meeting at the White House. And he left open the possibility of signing a peace declaration that would formally end the Korean War after nearly seven decades of military hostilities. "

He also appeared dismissive of the kind of full-bore preparation common to summit meetings. “This isn’t a question of preparation,” he said. “It’s a question of whether people want it to happen.” North Korea appears to be getting ready: Satellite imagery reported this week indicates that the country is demolishing some facilities used for testing one of its most dangerous missiles.

267,"To the Editor: Re “A Fiery Affront, Back in 1814, but You Can’t Blame Canada” (news article, June 7), about the report of President Trump’s mistaken suggestion that Canada burned down the White House two centuries ago: It was good of you to supply readers with a brief refresher course about the War of 1812, as Mr. Trump is surely not the only American to be a tad fuzzy about the details — or even, let’s be honest, the basics. With Independence Day less than a month off, now would not be a bad time to point out that Tchaikovsky’s “1812 Overture,” a perennially boisterous highlight of the Boston Pops’s nationally broadcast Fourth of July concert, not only has nothing to do with the aforementioned dispute, it also has nothing to do with America. The work commemorates Russia’s defense against Napoleon’s invading Grande Armée in 1812. Why does the Boston Pops perform a Russian-themed composition on America’s Independence Day? Because although our homegrown composers — Ives, Sousa, Copland, Gershwin, Ruggles, Bernstein — wrote an abundance of rousing patriotic music, they all forgot to include live cannon fire in the arrangements.

268,"SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook has been fighting for months the perception that it did not do enough to protect people’s privacy. On Thursday, the company said it had again failed to keep the information of millions of users private. As many as 14 million Facebook users who thought they were creating private posts last month that only a small group of friends could see were, in fact, making public posts that anyone could view. Facebook blamed a software bug for the problem. The company did not say how it had found the bug, or how it knew the problem was limited to 14 million people. In a statement, Facebook said the bug affected users from May 18 to May 22, while the company was testing a new feature. By May 27, the company had changed the affected posts from a public setting back to a private one. “We’d like to apologize for this mistake,” Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer, said in a statement. “We have fixed this issue, and starting today we are letting everyone affected know and are asking them to review any posts they made during that time.” In the last few months, Facebook executives have repeatedly been forced to apologize to users for failing to protect their privacy.

270,"You can see the gig economy everywhere but in the statistics. For years, economists, pundits and policymakers have grappled with the rise of Uber, the growth of temporary work and the fissuring of the relationship between companies and their workers. Optimists cheered the flexibility offered by the freelance life. Pessimists fretted about the disappearance of traditional jobs, with the benefits and legal protections they provided. That debate has played out largely in the absence of solid data. But on Thursday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its first in-depth look at nontraditional work since 2005, and came to a startling conclusion: The old-fashioned job remains king. Roughly 10 percent of American workers in 2017 were employed in some form of what the government calls “alternative work arrangements,” a broad category including Uber drivers, freelance writers and people employed through temporary-help agencies — essentially anyone whose main source of work comes outside a traditional employment relationship. Far from a boom in gig work, that represents a slight decline from 2005, when about 11 percent of workers fell into those categories. “I think everybody’s narrative got blown up,” said Michael R. Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Mr. Strain and other experts cautioned that the data released on Thursday did not signal the American workplace had remained static over the past decade. The government’s numbers, by design, do not include people who do gig or freelance work in addition to traditional jobs, and they may not fully capture income-generating activities that people might not consider “work,” like renting out a home on Airbnb. Separate data released by the Federal Reserve this month found that nearly a third of adults engaged in some form of gig work, either as a primary job or to supplement other sources of income. Private-sector surveys have reached similar conclusions. "

272,"HONG KONG — Two House Republicans have questioned a prominent American environmental group, contending that by praising China’s efforts to reduce pollution while criticizing American shortcomings it could be working as an agent of Chinese influence. A June 5 letter from two leading Republicans on the House Committee on Natural Resources to the nonprofit environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, requested documents on its relationship with the Chinese government and answers to questions on whether it should register as a foreign agent. The N.R.D.C., which was founded in 1970 and now has about 2.4 million members, has fought efforts to scale back environmental protections in the United States, suing the Trump administration about once every 10 days, according to N.R.D.C. officials. The group has also worked for years in China to improve the country’s air quality and reduce carbon emissions. The letter, from Rob Bishop, a Utah Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, and Bruce Westerman, an Arkansas Republican and chairman of the panel’s subcommittee on oversight and investigations, suggested the difference between the group’s aggressive stance in the United States and a more moderate tone in China meant it was serving Beijing’s interests. The letter was addressed to Rhea Suh, the N.R.D.C.’s president. “The committee is concerned about the N.R.D.C.’s role in aiding China’s perception management efforts with respect to pollution control and its international standing on environmental issues in ways that may be detrimental to the United States,” the letter said. At a time when foreign influence in American politics, particularly from Russia, is a subject of widespread national debate, the lawmakers’ attack on the N.R.D.C. could expose the group to criticism for differences in its approaches to working in China and the United States. "
273,"WASHINGTON — An American citizen detained by the military in Iraq as a suspected Islamic State member will be released back into Syria, the Trump administration has told a judge — a plan that his lawyers called “a death warrant.” The move would avoid a fight in court over the high-stakes question of whether the government has the legal authority to put Islamic State suspects in indefinite wartime detention as enemy combatants. If a judge were to rule against the government on that question in the detention case, it would jeopardize the underpinnings of the entire war effort against the Islamic State. But lawyers for the man, whose name has not been made public, vowed to fight the planned transfer in court. The plan was the latest twist in a habeas corpus case that has raised novel legal issues about the rights of individual Americans and the government’s wartime powers. The American Civil Liberties Union planned to file an emergency request for a temporary restraining order against the military on Thursday, said Jonathan Hafetz, an A.C.L.U. lawyer who is the lead attorney for the man. In its filing late Wednesday disclosing the government’s Syria release plan, the Justice Department said the military intended to release the man in an unidentified Syrian city after at least 72 hours had passed. The Pentagon, it said, had decided that releasing the man in Syria would be consistent with traditional military practice and with the department’s obligations under the law of war. It had given the man two options — release “either in a town or outside an internally displaced person camp” — but the man had balked at both, so the Pentagon picked the town option for him. "
274,"ZTE, the Chinese telecommunications giant that was on the brink of collapse after being hit with tough penalties by the Trump administration, has become a linchpin of trade relations between the United States and China. On Thursday, Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, said the administration had reached a deal to lift restrictions imposed on ZTE after it was found to have violated American sanctions related to doing business with countries like Iran and North Korea. ZTE’s fate has been at the center of a broader dispute between China and the United States, and the deal announced on Thursday could inflame a battle with Congress over national security interests. Here’s what you need to know. Zhongxing Telecommunications Equipment, known as ZTE, makes cheap smartphones that are mostly sold in developing countries, though it also sells them in the United States. But ZTE is one of two Chinese companies — Huawei is the other — that sell equipment for cellular networks. It has about 75,000 employees and says it does business in more than 160 countries. That makes it an important geopolitical pawn for Beijing, both as an innovator and as a builder of state-funded projects overseas. If China wants to improve ties with a government in the developing world, it often offers loans that can be used to set a ZTE-powered cellular network. Longer term, China hopes that companies like ZTE will become powerhouses that can help the country wean itself from a reliance on American tech firms, which Beijing views as security threats because of the possibility that they could help Washington spy. Tech supply chains are so intertwined these days that just about every product that ZTE makes has some American components or software in it — think microchips, modems and Google’s Android operating system. So if ZTE sells a smartphone to North Korea, it might also be selling a Qualcomm chip inside that phone. That’s illegal under American sanctions that prohibit the sale of United States tech to embargoed countries. "
275,"For several months, President Trump has been vandalizing the global economy and subverting the rules of international trade with his wrecking ball of tariff indiscretions. Finally, someone in Congress is doing something to stop this menace. Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, introduced legislation on Wednesday that takes back some of the authority President Trump has been abusing under the guise of protecting national security. Mr. Corker, who is retiring, attracted six Republican co-sponsors for the bill, which would amend the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to require the president to get approval from Congress for any tariffs proposed on national security grounds. But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said he would not allow the legislation to come to the floor as a stand-alone bill. House Speaker Paul Ryan seems similarly uninterested in a bill likely to be vetoed by Mr. Trump. “You would have to pass a law that he would want to sign into law,” Mr. Ryan said. “You can do the math on that.” Why don’t the president’s trade transgressions elicit meaningful resistance from party leadership? His trade views are disdainful of freedom and informed by economic fallacies, yet Republican leaders have watched quietly from the sidelines as Mr. Trump misappropriates his authorities to disrupt global supply chains, inflict pain on American trade partners, generate enormous amounts of domestic collateral damage and make the United States an international scofflaw. The United States Constitution vests authority in Congress to collect duties and to “regulate commerce with foreign nations.” But over the course of the 20th century, Congress delegated some of its authority to the president. In most cases, the statutes giving the executive branch the authority to raise tariffs require that certain conditions be met and that any actions taken be subject to limitations, as well as judicial review. President Trump has found a way to weaponize these statutes to advance his “America First” agenda. Since taking office, he has initiated six investigations under three highly contentious laws. Five of those investigations — on steel, aluminum, washing machines, solar panel components and Chinese technology products — have led to the president imposing or announcing tariffs on imports of more than 1,500 products valued at about $100 billion. A new investigation of whether imports of automobiles and parts constitute a national security threat could raise the value of sanctioned imports to $400 billion. Factoring in the likelihood of retaliation against American exporters, about 20 percent of total goods trade could find itself in the cross hairs by year’s end. "
276,"WASHINGTON — Hoping to defuse a Republican rebellion, Speaker Paul D. Ryan promised Thursday that House Republicans would draft compromise legislation on immigration, setting up a showdown on one of the thorniest political issues just as the midterm campaign comes into focus. Conservative Republicans loath to loosen immigration rules remained at odds with moderates pressing to protect young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, as Mr. Ryan and his fellow leaders in the House labored to reach an accord. And the deadline for an agreement could come within days. Moderate Republican lawmakers need only three more signatures on a petition to force a series of immigration votes over the speaker’s objections, including at least two that would focus on those young immigrants, known as Dreamers. Because of the arcane rules for such “discharge petitions,” those lawmakers face a Tuesday cutoff to gather the 218 names needed to force floor action in late June. “We have a firm deadline of Tuesday,” said Representative Jeff Denham of California, a leader of the petition drive. “Tuesday we will hit 218.” After a lengthy meeting with his conference to discuss immigration, Mr. Ryan stressed that pursuing a compromise bill would be a better course than forcing the issue through a petition. “The next step is to start putting pen to paper so we can get legislation to the floor,” Mr. Ryan told reporters after the meeting. He argued that if rank-and-file lawmakers were to go ahead with forcing immigration votes, the resulting measure would not become law. "
277,"The scenes in the political ads play out in almost the same order: A heartbreaking story about someone who can’t seem to stop taking drugs. A grim statistic about opioids. And then a somber pitch from a candidate promising solutions. More and more, politicians in competitive races are using emotional pleas about opioid abuse to woo voters. In states like Wisconsin, where hundreds of people are dying of opioid overdoses every year, candidates are talking about drugs in stump speeches, on Facebook and in ads. The opioid fight has become a shared talking point for Democrats and Republicans, who discuss the crisis using startlingly similar language and often vote together to pass bills. On Thursday, President Trump’s administration announced a series of public service announcements that aim to warn young adults about the dangers of opioid abuse. In one ad, a young woman says she intentionally crashed her car to get more opioids; in another, a man recounts breaking his arm to get another prescription. The videos all include the line, “Opioid dependence can happen after just five days.” Historically, Republicans have taken a law enforcement-first approach to drug crises, while Democrats have focused on treatment and prevention. Some sharp partisan divisions still exist over the best approach to the opioid crisis, including on Mr. Trump’s call for the death penalty for drug dealers and a wall along the border with Mexico to keep drugs out of the country. And some Democrats have moved to spend more on treatment, including a bill in Congress that calls for spending $100 million on opioid resources each year. "
278,"OTTAWA — Doug Ford, a brash populist and a brother of former Mayor Rob Ford of Toronto, will become the next premier of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, after leading his party to a decisive victory in elections on Thursday. Just 21 minutes after most polls closed, both the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and CTV News declared that Mr. Ford’s Progressive Conservative Party would gain a majority of seats in Ontario’s next provincial legislature. Mr. Ford, who declared victory in a speech to supporters Thursday night, has led the party and been involved in provincial politics for only a few weeks. A populist who campaigned on pledges to reduce the size of government and cut taxes — and bring back $1-a-bottle beer — he represents a significant change for Ontario, which has been under the control of the Liberal Party for almost 15 years. “My friends, help is here,” Mr. Ford told the crowd in Toronto. “Tonight we have sent a clear message to the world: Ontario is open for business.” As his supporters shouted “jobs, jobs, jobs,” Mr. Ford added: “Together we made history, we have taken back Ontario. We have delivered a government that is for the people.” The Conservatives began the race looking like they would easily sweep into power. But during the campaign their support eroded significantly in favor of the New Democratic Party, which started in third place. "

Samantha Bee apologized on “Full Frontal” on Wednesday for using a severe epithet to describe Ivanka Trump last week. But she didn’t apologize to everybody. “It is a word that I have used many times on the show, trying to reclaim it,” Bee said. “This time, I used it as an insult. I crossed the line, I regret it, and I do apologize for that.” But then Bee (who had issued a shortened apology a week earlier via Twitter) pushed back hard against conservative male pundits who had helped turn her comments into a flash point. “Many men were also offended by my use of the word. I do not care,” she said. “I should’ve known that a potty-mouthed insult would be inherently more interesting to them than a juvenile immigration policy.” (Bee devoted the next section of her show to the detention facilities where the Trump administration is now housing immigrant children separated from their parents by Border Patrol agents.) "
280,"KABUL, Afghanistan — President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan declared a brief, unilateral cease-fire with the Taliban on Thursday, a strategic gamble seen as a trust-building measure to encourage the militant group to conduct peace talks even as the war grows deadlier. The cease-fire, which Mr. Ghani said would go into effect for eight days starting next week to coincide with one of the holiest periods on the Muslim calendar, comes months after his government presented an extensive peace offer to the Taliban. But just what the cease-fire could mean for the prospect of peace talks was unclear, with the resurgent Taliban dictating the reality on the battlefield and, as a result, any moves toward peace. “This cease-fire is an opportunity for the Taliban to reflect that their violent campaign is not winning them hearts and minds but further alienating the Afghan people from their cause,” Mr. Ghani said in his announcement. Officials said the cease-fire applied only to the Taliban and their brutal arm, the Haqqani network, which is behind some of the deadliest attacks. Operations against the Islamic State, remnants of Al Qaeda and other regional terrorist groups will continue. The United Nations and representatives of European countries in Afghanistan welcomed the news of the cease-fire. Still, many diplomats said privately that they were caught off guard by the announcement, and senior Afghan officials struggled to explain the sudden move. "
281,"According to Alan Krueger and Eric Posner, in their tough minded — and much-needed — “Proposal for Protecting Low-Income Workers From Monopsony and Collusion,” the ideal labor market is one in which “workers can move freely to seek the most desirable opportunities for which they are qualified.” If only. As Adam Cobb, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, put it in an email conversation: The trend in recent years has been an inexorable shift of bargaining power to employers at the expense of employees. The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon in the case of Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31, which challenges the right of public employee unions in 22 states to collect dues from nonmembers who benefit from a union agreement that covers the cost of collective bargaining and contract compliance. If the court rules against organized labor as expected, it will inflict punishing financial hardship on the affected unions and will threaten the viability of many locals. Worker power has already suffered death by a thousand cuts, some political, others judicial and regulatory; some at the hands of a changing domestic workplace, others stemming from relentless global forces. Corporate America recognized these trends early on and capitalized on them ruthlessly. Labor organizations were ill equipped to do so and have been on the defensive for the past four decades. "
282,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Both Democrats and Republicans saw reason for hope after the primaries on Tuesday. Here’s our full report on the voting, as well as five takeaways. The Democrats, who had more on the line, increased their prospects of winning control of the House this fall by securing ballot spots in multiple California districts. The party had feared being shut out of some races because of the state’s quirky primary system. • For their part, the Republicans secured a spot in California’s governor’s race, which is seen as important to voter turnout in November. Read more about that race, which will offer a stark ideological choice between John Cox, a Republican businessman endorsed by President Trump, and Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor who has promised a “Marshall Plan” for the state. • There are signs of Republican resistance on Capitol Hill. On Wednesday, Mr. Ryan, the House speaker, joined other lawmakers in dismissing President Trump’s claims that the Justice Department had placed a spy in his campaign. He also said that Mr. Trump should not to try to pardon himself. Mr. Trump is facing dissent from members of his own party over a range of issues, particularly trade. He has drastically departed from the traditional Republican embrace of free markets. • Also on Wednesday, Mr. Trump commuted the sentence of a 63-year-old woman serving life in prison for a nonviolent drug conviction after her case was brought to his attention by the celebrity Kim Kardashian West. "
283,"Those of us who were afraid that the Supreme Court would use the Masterpiece Cakeshop case to issue a license to discriminate against gay people in the name of religion breathed a sigh of relief on Monday. The court’s insistence that the dignity and equality of gay individuals “must be given great weight and respect by the courts” made clear that no such general license will be forthcoming as long as the majority opinion’s author, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, remains on the bench. “As long as” is an important qualification, of course; the retirement intentions of Justice Kennedy, who turns 82 next month and is the court’s longest-serving current member, are the subject of increasingly frantic speculation. I’d like to offer an additional qualification, one that hasn’t received sufficient attention amid all the parsing of the court’s odd and unexpected 7-to-2 decision. My concern is with the implications of the court’s unfounded conclusion that Colorado officials expressed such deep “hostility” to religion as to have inflicted an injury of constitutional dimension on a baker who claimed that his religious view against same-sex marriage prevented him from making a celebratory cake for a gay couple. As many have noted, the path the court took toward ruling for the baker clearly reflected a compromise among justices with very different views. The court dealt with the profound issues of free expression and freedom of religion that the case seemed to present (whether it really presented them is a separate question) by avoiding them; as Prof. Michael Dorf of Cornell Law School wrote of the opinion, “At best, it is a masterpiece of ducking the hard questions.” So it was the search for an off-ramp that led the court to its obsessive focus on statements about religion made by two of the seven members of the Colorado Civil Rights Commission at two hearings in 2014 on the gay couple’s discrimination complaint against the baker. (Colorado law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by “public accommodations,” a category that includes most businesses.) At the first hearing, a commissioner observed that “if a businessman wants to do business in the state and he’s got an issue with the law’s impacting his personal belief system, he needs to look at being able to compromise.” At the second, a commissioner observed that religion “has been used to justify all kinds of discrimination throughout history” and proceeded to label religion “one of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that people can use to — to use their religion to hurt others.” Following these hearings, the commission found that the baker’s refusal to serve his customers was an act of discrimination that violated state law. That decision was upheld by the Colorado Court of Appeals which, Justice Kennedy noted with disapproval, “did not mention those comments, much less express concern with their content.” Neither, he added, did the state itself disavow the comments in its presentation to the Supreme Court — a point Justice Kennedy had made when the case was argued six months ago. “For these reasons, the court cannot avoid the conclusion that these statements cast doubt on the fairness and impartiality of the commission’s adjudication,” Justice Kennedy wrote, adding that the commission “was neither tolerant nor respectful” of the baker’s religious beliefs. This “hostility” toward religion, the court held, violated the baker’s First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion. "

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced on Thursday that the U.S. has struck an agreement to save the embattled telecom company. But it’s unclear whether the White House has gotten a good deal. The background: In April, the Trump administration blocked ZTE from buying U.S.-made equipment, a serious blow to the Chinese company. But in recent weeks, Mr. Trump has directed the Commerce Department to reach a compromise to help save the firm. Here are the main details of the agreement, per Mr. Ross on CNBC: • A $1 billion fine, and an additional $400 million penalty that will be held to cover potential future violations • Changes to ZTE’s board and management team within 30 days • A compliance team chosen by U.S. officials embedded in the Chinese company "
285,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. American politics today is rife with cynicism. Many Americans don’t vote. Others do, while lamenting polarization in Congress and distrusting the two major political parties. I understand the cynicism. The situation in Washington is worse than any I expected to see in my lifetime, as I wrote earlier this week. But the truth is that our national cynicism is a big part of the problem — and that individual citizens, working together, have a significant amount of power to change things. It’s already happened several times in the last decade or so. A grass-roots movement propelled a first-term senator from Illinois, a man who was virtually unknown five years earlier, to the presidency. A very different movement, known as the Tea Party, then became an effective opposition to that president. Most recently, the so-called Trump resistance has helped save health insurance for millions of Americans — and has helped create a surge of voter turnout in recent elections. We’re living in a funny time: Americans are both disgusted by and obsessed with politics. If there is any silver lining to the Trump presidency, it’s the new spirit of political engagement that many Americans feel. In response to that new spirit, my colleague Ian Prasad Philbrick and I have put together a guide to help people get more involved in politics. It offers advice on grass-roots organizing, donating money, voting and even running for office. (For now, the guide is available only to Times subscribers, though it will likely be opened to all readers later this year.) "
286,"SANTIAGO, Chile — Throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, people have lost confidence in elections and politicians. And just as voters are questioning the democratic process, the traditional watchdogs of electoral integrity — multilateral groups like the United Nations and the Organization of American States and others — are being undermined by governments throughout the hemisphere on both sides of the ideological spectrum. The twin pressures of declining trust in elections and support for those who guarantee voting integrity create a problem: Who is left to credibly judge what may be controversial elections in the coming months in two of the region’s biggest countries, Mexico and Brazil? Over the past 30 years, election observer groups have helped establish internationally respected standards for free and fair elections, protected voters’ rights in those elections and defused political upheaval when sore losers have tried to steal elections or contested results. This happened in the Dominican Republic in 1994, Peru in 2000, Mexico in 2006 and Ecuador in 2017. The power of neutral observers to defend free elections rests on a commitment from a government holding an election to the idea that these organizations have the right and authority to determine whether the voting was fair. That commitment is under assault. In November of last year, the Trump administration rushed to embrace the contested re-election of President Juan Orlando Hernández of Honduras, an American ally, even after observers from the European Union and the Organization of American States raised concerns about the integrity of the vote counting. And last month, when President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela invited the United Nations to observe presidential elections, it was widely viewed as a farce. The election was denounced by the European Union and 14 countries in the hemisphere as a sham, rigged to re-elect Mr. Maduro. Knowing that election monitors would not have independence, the United Nations stayed away. "

288,"When he landed in Michigan in late May, all the weary little boy carried was a trash bag stuffed with dirty clothes from his dayslong trek across Mexico, and two small pieces of paper — one a stick-figure drawing of his family from Honduras, the other a sketch of his father, who had been arrested and led away after they arrived at the United States border in El Paso. An American government escort handed over the 5-year-old child, identified on his travel documents as José, to the American woman whose family was entrusted with caring for him. He refused to take her hand. He did not cry. He was silent on the ride “home.” The first few nights, he cried himself to sleep. Then it turned into “just moaning and moaning,” said Janice, his foster mother. He recently slept through the night for the first time, though he still insists on tucking the family pictures under his pillow. José’s separation from his father is part of the Trump administration’s latest and most widely debated border enforcement policy. Last month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the government would criminally prosecute everyone who crosses the border illegally, a directive that is already leading to the breakup of hundreds of migrant families and channeling children into shelters and foster homes across the country. The goal, according to administration officials, is to discourage Central American families from making the perilous journey to the United States’ southwest border, where they have been arriving in swelling numbers this year to claim asylum. In just the first two weeks under President Trump’s new policy, 638 parents who arrived with 658 children had been prosecuted, administration officials told Congress. "
289,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) As Gavin Newsom and John Cox gathered on election night with supporters of their campaigns for governor in San Francisco and San Diego, another man loomed over the celebrations: President Trump. The president endorsed Mr. Cox last month, and despite Mr. Trump’s lackluster popularity in California, the Cox campaign has overwhelmingly embraced the association. “We put a businessman in the White House, let’s put a businessman in the governor’s mansion,” Mr. Cox said triumphantly on Tuesday night, shortly after he secured enough votes in the primary to earn a place on the general election ballot in November. Mr. Trump’s endorsement tweet was even pasted to the bottom of news releases sent by the campaign. Mr. Cox has not only rejected the negative attacks on the White House by California Democrats, but has also sought to flip those critiques back onto liberals by emphasizing high taxes and high rates of poverty and homelessness in the state. “It wasn’t Donald Trump that made California the highest-taxed state in the country; it was Gavin Newsom and the Democrats,” he said. Mr. Newsom, for his part, has already shown his desire to frame the contest as a referendum on Mr. Trump’s agenda, and has painted Mr. Cox as a surrogate for the president. "
290,"For 10 years, Ralph Peters regularly appeared on Fox News to offer military analysis and insight as one of the cable network’s reliably conservative commenters. But he quit in March in disgust. Mr. Peters, who announced his departure in a blistering farewell note to his colleagues, followed up on Wednesday with another searing attack, saying that the network was “doing a great, grave disservice to our country.” The retired lieutenant colonel in the United States Army spoke on CNN in his first television interview since his departure. “With the rise of Donald Trump, Fox did become a destructive propaganda machine,” Mr. Peters said. “And I don’t do propaganda for anyone.” For the decade he worked there, Mr. Peters said he believed that Fox News was a necessary and legitimate conservative bulwark in the news media and an outlet for libertarian opinions. But under President Trump, the network shifted rightward, he said. Its popular prime time hosts, particularly Sean Hannity, started to echo Mr. Trump’s debunked theories of a “deep state” undermining his administration. They joined the president in steadily attacking the Justice Department, the F.B.I. and other democratic institutions, Mr. Peters said. “I suspect Sean Hannity really believes it,” he said. “The others are smarter. They know what they’re doing. It’s bewildering to me. I mean, I wanted to just cry out and say: ‘How can you do this? How can you lie to our country?’” On Thursday morning, Alisyn Camerota, a former Fox News anchor who now works at CNN, said that Mr. Peters’s remarks mirrored her own experience at the network. “I too was upset about the blurring of the lines between propaganda and journalism,” Ms. Camerota said after a clip of his remarks was played. “I don’t know whether the viewers know the difference between the prime time hosts and the great reporters there.” Fox News said Thursday that it stood by its statement from when Mr. Peters departed in March. “Ralph Peters is entitled to his opinion despite the fact that he’s choosing to use it as a weapon in order to gain attention,” the network said then. “We are extremely proud of our top-rated prime time hosts and all of our opinion programing.” Fox News and Mr. Trump enjoy a symbiotic relationship. He is a loyal viewer of its morning program “Fox & Friends,” often tweeting about what the hosts discuss and sometimes calling in for lengthy interviews. At night, a lineup of opinion shows offers a friendly space for Trump supporters. The friendliest might be “Hannity,” whose host is also an influential Trump confidant. Mr. Hannity, as well as reporters and anchors from the network’s news division, are traveling to Singapore for Mr. Trump’s June 12 summit meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. “Hannity” will be broadcast live for three nights in Singapore, the network said.

291,"What books do journalists like to read? Books about journalists, of course! It doesn’t hurt when those books — and their subjects — are as interesting as the two we feature this week: “Reporter,” a memoir by the legendary investigative journalist Seymour M. Hersh, and “Flash,” Christopher Bonanos’s biography of the larger-than-life tabloid photographer Weegee. You’ll also find some good escapist reading here, including a perfect thriller (“Our Kind of Cruelty”), a topical and unsettling graphic novel (“Sabrina”) and the latest horror tale from a modern master (“The Outsider,” by Stephen King). It’s beginning to feel a lot like summer. Gregory Cowles
Senior Editor, Books REPORTER: A Memoir, by Seymour M. Hersh. (Knopf, $27.95.) Hersh won a Pulitzer in 1970, at 33, for his freelance expose on the massacre by American troops at My Lai village during the Vietnam War. He was soon hired by The New York Times, where he uncovered C.I.A. domestic spying and the secret bombing of Cambodia, among other things. Later in his career, he reported for The New Yorker on the torture of prisoners by Americans at Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. “For Hersh’s subjects, becoming an object of his interest is like having the Red Baron on your tail,” our critic Dwight Garner writes in his review of this expansive memoir. “So many of journalism’s old war dogs have left or are leaving us, and there’s a sense that we won’t get many more memoirs like this one. If this book’s pilot light isn’t fully lit, it still puts a big career across.” FLASH: The Making of Weegee the Famous, by Christopher Bonanos. (Holt, $32.) The photographer Arthur Fellig, better known as Weegee, lugged his enormous Speed Graphic camera around the nighttime streets of New York City in the 1930s and ’40s, cultivating a persona as stark and as memorable as his tabloid pictures. He was the wisecracking tummler in the rumpled suit, always on the lookout for a car crash or a dead gangster. With “Flash,” Bonanos (the city editor of New York magazine and the author of an earlier book about Polaroid) has “finally supplied us with the biography Weegee deserves: sympathetic and comprehensive, a scrupulous account with just the right touch of irreverence,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. This is a portrait that “takes the photographer seriously without letting him and his self-mythologizing off the hook.” THE OUTSIDER, by Stephen King. (Scribner, $30.) When police officers arrest a small-town English teacher and Little League coach for murder, the case looks watertight. But this isn’t a police procedural, it’s a Stephen King novel; so nothing, of course, is what it seems. “Monsters of one kind or another are what the man does best, and ‘The Outsider’ delivers a good one,” Victor LaValle writes in his review. “King is an industry,” he adds, but “he isn’t writing mere imitations of himself. More than 50 novels published, and he’s still adding new influences to his work. I can think of a great many literary writers who are far lazier about their range of inspirations and interests.” OUR KIND OF CRUELTY, by Araminta Hall. (MCD/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26.) In this searing, chilling sliver of perfection about a toxic relationship, the man is the psychopath — or is it all a game, with the tacit support of his complicit ex-girlfriend? “We grow uneasy, wondering if in fact all we’re reading is a portrait of entwined madness and male entitlement,” Charles Finch writes in his review. “That doubt lingers all the way through the stunning final pages of ‘Our Kind of Cruelty,’ which may well turn out to be the year’s best thriller.” "
292,"One hundred years ago, Congress passed one of the earliest and most consequential conservation laws, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Its language was, and remains, clear and straightforward: Unless an individual has a valid hunting permit, “it shall be unlawful at any time, by any means, or in any manner” to “hunt, take, capture [or] kill” migratory birds. Until now, that is. Power lines, communication towers, wind turbines, oil spills and poison and pesticide applications kill tens of millions of birds a year, according to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Many are protected by the act, and their deaths, though unintentional, could be considered violations. Those responsible can be held strictly liable, meaning they are culpable, even if the deaths weren’t intended. This standard is meant to encourage companies to find ways to minimize threats to the 1,000-plus bird species protected by the law, and the relatively few enforcement actions have been limited to the most egregious violations. Now, however, as part of the Trump administration’s drive to remove “unnecessary” regulatory “burdens” on the energy industry, the Interior Department has advanced an alternative interpretation of the law that absolves companies from engaging in foreseeable and preventable activities that kill birds. The department’s political appointees argue that the law only triggers penalties when individuals or companies are trying to kill migratory birds. The implications of the Interior Department’s new position on bird killings are troubling, because building owners, oil and wind energy companies and others will no longer have any legal incentive to reduce or eliminate bird deaths caused by their operations. If this view holds, companies like Exxon or BP would no longer bear any responsibility for bird deaths from oil spills like the thousands that occurred in the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon disasters. Nor, as is now playing out in South Dakota, would a pest control operator need to pay any heed to the fact that poisoning prairie dogs will also kill burrowing owls — migratory birds that also inconveniently occupy prairie dog burrows. The Trump administration had to work hard to pull off such a radical reinterpretation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The legal opinion takes more than 40 pages to twist the law’s clear language outlawing bird killings resulting from “any means whatever” and occurring “at any time or in any manner” into a contrived new standard that only penalizes bird killings when “the actor [is] engaged in an activity the object of which was to render an animal subject to human control.” "
293,"LOS ANGELES — James Van Der Beek may be best known for playing the title character in “Dawson’s Creek,” a 1990s teen drama fueled by adolescent angst and Sperry boat shoes, and maybe an ugly crying face GIF that spawned a thousand memes.   But on a recent Monday, all he wanted to do was fight. “Let’s get into it!” said Mr. Van Der Beek, 41, who was at 87Eleven, a stunt and choreography studio near the Los Angeles International Airport.    Wearing a black Under Armour hoodie with matching shorts and compression tights, he was trying to master a fight sequence for an action TV show he is developing. The scene had him fending off multiple assailants, so it involved complex choreography. It’s not the only new project on Mr. Van Der Beek’s IMDB page. He had just returned from New York, where he spent the better part of the spring shooting “Pose,” Ryan Murphy’s new show about the 1980s vogueing scene.   Mr. Van Der Beek plays a character named Matt Bromley, the swaggering right-hand man of Donald J. Trump, who personifies the era’s embrace of wealth and greed. "
294,"LA MALBAIE, Quebec — Ever since Rosaire Tremblay bought a candy-cane-colored house overlooking the St. Lawrence River two years ago, tourists have trampled on his land to photograph the spectacular view, gawk at the beluga whales or reach the imposing Fairmont Le Manoir Richelieu hotel, perched on a nearby cliff. Then came the fence. Canada is hosting world leaders, including President Trump, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and President Emmanuel Macron of France, starting Friday at a two-day Group of 7 summit meeting in this picture-perfect resort town. The leaders are to discuss, among other things, job creation, gender equality and climate change. Mr. Tremblay’s house is the only home in town in a high-security “red zone” near Le Manoir Richelieu, where the world leaders will stay. Suddenly, his modest red and white home is protected by a nearly two-mile-long steel security fence affixed with lights and cameras, making it among the most secure and impenetrable fortresses in the country. Now, Mr. Tremblay, 63, a jovial retired factory owner and avid consumer of political news, has to pass through security checks to get to his own house. And the fancy hotel is off limits, so the best he can hope for is to spot his favorite leader, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, as she flies overhead by helicopter. But Mr. Tremblay is good-humored about the hassle. Like many residents here, he hopes the summit meeting’s global exposure will restore some glamour to this sleepy village of 9,000 in the Charlevoix region, which once attracted Hollywood stars but has since seen tough times. “I am hoping the leaders will at least help put Charlevoix on the map,” he said. A senior official involved in the selection process said the choice of where to hold the meeting came down to, among other places, Charlevoix and Kelowna, British Columbia, but that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada had chosen Charlevoix because of its secure location and natural beauty. "
295,"Seven nations are getting together to discuss gender equality with a leader who once bragged about grabbing women’s genitals, pluralism and tolerance with politicians who have promised to turn away refugees, and economic cooperation with a country severing ties with its neighbors. What could go wrong? Welcome to the Group of 7 Summit in Charlevoix, Quebec, a gathering of the leaders of seven countries that once dominated the world economy, but now struggle with the forces of globalization they helped to unleash. Expectations are low that the summit meeting on Friday and Saturday will produce much more than photo ops of Quebec scenery. It is likely to highlight a decline in the effectiveness of organizations designed to resolve international conflicts, like the World Trade Organization or the United Nations. “Multilateralism is in crisis,” said Dennis Snower, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Kiel, Germany. “We have a number of international organizations that are either stalemated or their representation is not fit for the present day.” The members of the Group of 7 — the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan — once stood together against communism. But now they are often in conflict with each other and struggling to prove their relevance amid China’s growing power. The agenda put together by Canada, this year’s host, would not have provoked much controversy a few years ago. Women’s empowerment. Climate change. Adapting to the changing nature of work. "
296,"Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney in Manhattan who was fired by President Trump, has registered as a Democratic voter in New York for the first time in more than a decade amid speculation that he might run for attorney general. Mr. Bharara’s registration in Westchester County occurred during the window for candidates to gather signatures to qualify for the Democratic primary in September. A candidate needs thousands of signatures across half the congressional districts by mid-July — meaning time is short for Mr. Bharara to jump in. Mr. Bharara did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Democratic primary for attorney general is already crowded. It includes Letitia James, the New York City public advocate, who was nominated at the state party convention; Representative Sean Patrick Maloney of the Hudson Valley; Zephyr Teachout, a law professor and former candidate for governor; and Leecia Eve, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. They are running to replace Eric Schneiderman, who resigned suddenly last month after multiple women accused him of physical abuse. Barbara D. Underwood, who was chosen last month to replace Mr. Schneiderman, has said she would not seek election in November. Mr. Bharara, who has become an outspoken commentator since Mr. Trump fired him last year, has built a liberal following. He addressed the idea of running for attorney general last month on his podcast. “I think politics is not really for me, but it’s an important job, it’s an important time so we’ll see,” said Mr. Bharara, who is also a former aide to the Senate minority leader, Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. Before he registered as a Democrat, the Reform Party in New York had hoped to recruit Mr. Bharara onto its ticket, endorsing him prospectively at a party gathering last month. But party officials could not reach Mr. Bharara to accept their spot on the ballot. “No luck reaching him,” Curtis Sliwa, the Reform Party chairman, said in an email. Mr. Bharara was not a registered voter during his roughly eight years as United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, a period in which he aggressively prosecuted political corruption, indicting the top two lawmakers in Albany, one Democrat and one Republican, and a top aide to Mr. Cuomo. If remaining unregistered kept him at arm’s length from electoral politics, it also means he did not cast a ballot in the 2016 presidential campaign, an issue opponents could raise in a Democratic primary. Records show Mr. Bharara was previously registered as a Democrat in Maryland and in New York. "
297,"WASHINGTON — President Trump handed the Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE a lifeline on Thursday, agreeing to lift tough American sanctions over the objections of Republican lawmakers, his defense advisers and some of his own economic officials. The deal will help defuse tensions with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who personally asked Mr. Trump to intervene to save ZTE and whom the president has relied on to help pave the way for next week’s summit meeting with the North Korean leader. The Commerce Department said that ZTE had agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, replace its board and senior leadership, and allow the United States to more closely inspect the company by effectively having a handpicked compliance team embedded inside the firm. The United States would then lift a seven-year ban that prevented the company from buying American products and was quickly driving it out of business. [Read more about ZTE.] But the settlement has inflamed lawmakers, including top Republicans, who objected to helping a Chinese company that broke American law and has been accused of posing a national security threat. It also puts the United States in an awkward position as it punishes allies like Canada, Mexico and the European Union with stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum, and insists that countries in Europe and elsewhere abide by American sanctions on Iran. In 2016, the United States found the Chinese company guilty of violating American sanctions on Iran and North Korea. In April, the government said ZTE had failed to take the necessary actions to rectify the issue, and had lied about its efforts, prompting the Commerce Department to implement the ban. Defense officials have also repeatedly expressed concern about the risk that ZTE’s equipment could pose to national security. Lawmakers moved swiftly to try to scuttle the agreement on Thursday as a bipartisan group of senators introduced an amendment that would automatically reinstate ZTE’s ban on purchasing American products until the president certified to Congress that the company had met certain conditions. "
298,"WASHINGTON — President Trump declared Wednesday that North Korea is “no longer a nuclear threat” to the United States even though the two sides had yet to forge a concrete disarmament plan and offered incomplete accounts of what they agreed to during this week’s summit meeting in Singapore. Rejoicing in the glow of a historic encounter, Mr. Trump returned to Washington and portrayed his agreement with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, as a signal achievement that meant that the outcast state was no longer the United States’ most dangerous problem. But the path to disarmament remained no clearer a day after the meeting. North Korea’s state-controlled news media described a step-by-step process to dismantle its nuclear weapons, with the United States rewarding it at each stage, something Mr. Trump has seemed to reject in the past. Mr. Trump’s team insisted that North Korea had agreed to an intrusive inspection regime even though Pyongyang made no mention of that. The confusion stemmed from a joint statement that was long on lofty language and short on specifics. Signed Tuesday with a flourish by Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, the statement offered more aspiration than action, clocking in at only 391 words. Mr. Trump was hardly sweating the details, however, convinced that his meeting with Mr. Kim, the first between leaders of their two countries, had transformed the relationship and ended an era of hostility and mutual threats of destruction. “Just landed - a long trip, but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office,” he wrote on Twitter. “There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.” "
299,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Was Outfoxed in Singapore” (column, June 13): I usually agree with Nicholas Kristof on almost anything he writes about, but I’m not in full agreement here. The main narrative in most articles in The Times is that President Trump got played, making major concessions with virtually nothing in return. However, that’s not quite true. Even though the agreement that Mr. Trump and Kim Jong-un signed lacks specifics on implementation, it does set forth basic principles of what the two nations are aiming for. Yes, Mr. Kim can play this false, as every other North Korean dictator has, but it certainly sets the stage for further discussions on the technical issues. I firmly do not like President Trump and hope he gets impeached, but I’m willing to admit that if he actually pulls this off, it is a worthwhile achievement and should be supported. Don’t forget that Mr. Trump said the United States is not removing any sanctions until there is a verifiable, significant dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program. I say stay this course and see what happens. BARRY FISHER, COSTA MESA, CALIF. To the Editor: North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, runs one of the most brutal dictatorships in the world with an iron fist. He recklessly shoots test missiles over Japan and has threatened to destroy the United States with nuclear weapons. He buys luxurious items for himself and his cronies while much of his population is starving. He has imprisoned over 200,000 of his own people in horrific work camps, with many subjected to hard labor, malnourished and tortured. He has brutally killed his own relatives, including his half-brother, to secure power and has harshly treated Americans and other foreigners in captivity — who were often arrested for minor offenses — causing the death of at least one American.

301,"For several years, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Timothy Draper has sought to break up California, citing its unwieldy size as damaging to the state’s schools, livability and the economy. In November, California residents will get their chance to vote on his latest proposal: to divide the world’s fifth-largest economy into three separate states. Mr. Draper, who made his fortune investing in start-up companies, is proposing that the state of 40 million people be split into three entities with roughly the same populations. Northern California would comprise the upper part of the state, including Silicon Valley and San Francisco; Southern California would include a vast swath of the inland’s verdant farmland, stretching to San Diego; a third state, simply called California, would hug the coastline from Monterey to Los Angeles. If Californians approve the controversial ballot measure, which academics and others say faces many obstacles, it would still need the blessing of the California Legislature and the United States Congress. Politicians, for one, may be wary of splitting up a state that has long voted Democrat. Vikram Amar, a professor and dean of the College of Law at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, said California’s conservative-leaning inland empire (which would be part of the new Southern California) could swing Republican. “That is a risk Democrats in California and Washington, D.C., will be loath to run,” he said. Californians have long debated whether they were better as a whole or in parts. In 1941, a group of secessionists along the border of Northern California and Southern Oregon proposed creating a new state called “Jefferson.” It was called the “Yreka Rebellion” then, and was initially dismissed as a publicity stunt. It gained momentum as rural voters sought autonomy from their urban counterparts, a common refrain among Californians. "
302,"PARIS — A boat crowded with hundreds of Africans sailing across the Mediterranean after being turned away by Italy this week has exposed anew the shaky fault lines in Europe’s approach to the migrant crisis. On Sunday, Italy’s new far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, ordered the Aquarius, a rescue ship operated by humanitarian groups, to stop 35 nautical miles off the coast of Italy, refusing to let it dock. The ship is now on its way to Spain, which showed up its neighbors by solemnly announcing that it would “respect its international engagements” and accept the boat after Malta, too, refused it, and France stood idly by. Brussels, the seat of the European Union, looked on in relative silence. There was no common policy to receive the Aquarius and no authority to impose one if there were. The imbroglio was “symptomatic of the lack of coordination of a managed migration policy at the European Union level,” said Imogen Sudbery of the International Rescue Committee in Brussels. The Italian refusal to offer safe harbor to a ship loaded with what aid groups described as 629 migrants — including 123 minors, 11 small children and seven pregnant women — was intended to underscore a long-simmering grievance.

303,"To the Editor: Re “Voters in G.O.P. Punish Criticism of the President” (front page, June 13): So now it is not enough to vote for President Trump’s policies, as Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina has mostly done. He has also dared to criticize the president’s outrageous behavior, and that is no longer permissible. His opponent attacked him for “bashing our captain.” Mr. Trump is now fully unleashed, and the parallels with authoritarian leaders grow apace. The “cult of personality,” in Mr. Sanford’s words, that is dominating the Republican Party is fully formed. I am very scared. JANICE GEWIRTZ
MOUNTAIN LAKES, N.J. "
304,"WASHINGTON — The White House’s guest list last week for President Trump’s first dinner celebrating the Muslim holy month of Ramadan included a who’s who of diplomats from the Middle East. But the event turned out to be more notable for who apparently was not there: representatives from Muslim American groups. The night highlighted a paradox of Mr. Trump’s presidency. While he has sought to ally himself with Middle Eastern leaders, in part by at times softening his hostile tone on Islam, at home Mr. Trump has seemingly made little attempt to repair his fractured relationship with Muslim Americans — even those in his own party. Saba Ahmed, the president of the Republican Muslim Coalition and a Trump supporter, said that at the outset of the presidency, there was a “complete shutdown of engagement” with Muslim Americans. “It was quite a challenge” to work with Mr. Trump’s campaign staff, Ms. Ahmed said. “Even for the Republican Muslims who campaigned for him and helped him.” The reinstatement of the dinner, which has been hosted by three previous presidents, and the departures of some staff members with hard-line views on Islam have left her optimistic that the White House will grant more access to its Muslim supporters. “They have tarnished the image of Islam and Muslims, but I do think he is concerned about American Muslims,” Ms. Ahmed said. “The fact that he’s coming around, that he hosted the dinner, gives me a lot of hope.” "
305,"Archie Parnell, a Democratic House candidate who lost the support of his party after he admitted to physically abusing his ex-wife in the 1970s, handily won a primary in South Carolina on Tuesday. Mr. Parnell rose to national attention last year when he came within a hair’s breadth of winning a special election to replace Representative Mick Mulvaney in the state’s deep red Fifth District. Mr. Mulvaney left Congress in 2017 to serve as President Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget. On Tuesday, Mr. Parnell won 60 percent of the vote according to The Associated Press, easily beating three lesser known primary opponents with not as much name recognition. He will now mount another campaign against Representative Ralph Norman, the Republican who beat him in the special election last year. [Here are three key takeaways from Tuesday night’s primaries.] Mr. Norman’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. In a statement posted to Facebook on Wednesday morning, Mr. Parnell said the result had left him “deeply honored and humbled.” “Tonight, the people sent a clear message to everyone,” he wrote. “You don’t have to be defined by your worst mistake. You don’t have to be cast aside. You are not alone. You can be better. And, together, we can be better.” "
306,"MEXICO CITY — The subtext was hard to miss. On Wednesday morning, soon after the announcement that the United States, Mexico and Canada had won the vote to be joint hosts of the 2026 World Cup, President Enrique Peña Nieto posted a video on Twitter celebrating the news. Standing in front of the presidential residence, Los Pinos, he pointed out that Mexico would become the first country to host three World Cups. He extolled the virtues of Mexico as a tourist destination, including its beaches, archaeological sites and “hospitable and warm people.” And he zeroed in on a concept that has been evasive of late in the bilateral relationship with the United States. “We’re deeply unified,” he said, of the three host countries. “Congratulations for being hosts together.” He emphasized the word “together” by clenching his fist. Mr. Peña Nieto made no mention of President Trump. But the American president could not have been far from his mind. These have been trying times for the relationship between Mexico and the United States, and the World Cup, a magnificently complicated undertaking, would seem to impose an additional test. "

308,"A federal judge’s ruling on Tuesday to greenlight the merger between AT&T and Time Warner is a big boost to the competitiveness of the American economy and an even bigger win for consumers and shareholders. The decision was also a total slapdown of the antitrust division of the Justice Department, which sees monopoly bogeymen around every corner. The Justice Department must now decide whether to appeal the judge’s ruling, a move that would be sheer folly and a waste of taxpayer money, given the firm rejection of every argument the government’s lawyers made. Hopefully, this decision will also clear the path for other planned cost-cutting mergers in the media and telecommunications industries. The government’s antitrust challenge to this $85 billion deal was one of the flimsiest assaults against a corporate merger in recent memory. These two companies don’t even directly compete with each other. Normally, antitrust cases are brought to block so-called “horizontal” mergers, in which companies in the same line of business — two airlines, for example — want to combine forces. Even in such instances, the antitrust laws are antiquated, given that globalized competition and the speed of technological change continually knock down industry leaders. The core argument brought by the Justice Department, in an antitrust action championed by President Trump, was that AT&T could use its new market power to raise prices exorbitantly on cable and satellite operators that want to run Time Warner TV programs — such as CNN broadcasts or HBO shows. The government’s lawyers argued that consumers’ cable bills would go up if the merger went through. The absurdity of this argument is that the Justice lawyers seemed to be stuck in the 1980s. In 2018, the number of American households getting their television or video entertainment from traditional cable providers is declining. The very notion of “watching TV” is becoming as obsolete as listening to music on a turntable. My teenage kids and their friends don’t even own TVs. They watch “Game of Thrones” on their computers or smartphones, and one of their favorite “channels” is YouTube. They can choose from thousands of programs at a very low cost. Today, any hotshot with a camera and a Facebook page can be a media company. Is that enough competition for the Justice Department? "
309,"Ivana Trump was back at the Plaza Hotel on Tuesday, the hotel where she once had a say over everything from the wallpaper to the chandeliers, back when she was married to Donald J. Trump. But that was long ago. Now, she had come to promote a diet that promises followers they can “eat pasta, cookies and lose weight.” It was Ms. Trump who gave Mr. Trump a definite article — she put the “the” in “the Donald” — long before he had a job that came with one, as the president. On Tuesday, as reporters crowded around her at the Plaza, she was asked how often she talks to her ex-husband. “I’m really not going to go into politics,” she said, “but we speak.” But later, when she was asked how she thought he had done at the summit meeting on North Korea, she said, “He did great.” But about that diet. It is the brainchild of Gianluca Mech. He is an Italian businessman perhaps best known for spending $200,000 to recreate, for one night last year, the Brooklyn discothèque where “Saturday Night Fever,” the 1977 homage to the bell-bottoms-and-disco-ball era, was filmed. He is extremely thin, although he said his father was obese. His “Italiano Diet” offers specially formulated low-calorie, low-carbohydrate packaged meals. There are $20 cookies dipped in dark chocolate, $24 crunchy bars with strawberries and raspberries and, for $14, fusilli pasta. Ms. Trump, who once appeared in commercials for Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken, said she agreed to talk up the Italiano Diet because “obesity is like a calamity in America,” although she said that she herself did not need to shed pounds. "
310,"WASHINGTON — In the latest sign of the Trump administration’s outreach to religious conservatives ahead of a critical midterm election, Vice President Mike Pence told a large gathering of pastors Wednesday that the White House would continue to fight for evangelical priorities. He appealed for the community’s continued support, even as his appearance led to complaints that a religious event was being used for political gain. “This is a pivotal year in the life of our nation,” Mr. Pence told the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention, where nearly 10,000 evangelical pastors gathered in Dallas. “Be assured of this, President Trump and I are going to continue to fight for what we know is right.” Mr. Pence recited a list of Trump administration actions that appealed to the conservative evangelical community, which constitutes one of the president’s biggest blocs of supporters. Among the accomplishments he cited were the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court; advancing anti-abortion priorities across the government; opening an American embassy in Jerusalem; passing tax reform; and freeing Christian hostages from North Korea. “This progress,” Mr. Pence said, “is the result of the support of men and women like so many of you, who supported our president not only in 2016 but every day since.” The Southern Baptist Convention’s annual gathering in June draws thousands of evangelical influencers from across the country, presenting a rich opportunity for the administration to reach one of its most supportive voter bases. More than 80 percent of white evangelicals voted for Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence in 2016, and Southern Baptist churches have more than 15 million members. While the convention has at times had Republican leaders speak, its stated purpose is to focus on evangelism and missionary work. But Mr. Pence mentioned “the president” more than three dozen times in his 30 minute speech. "
311,"WASHINGTON — They have issued concerned news releases and sent solemn tweets. But when it came time to stand up to President Trump on tariffs this week, Senate Republicans took a pass, casting aside the party’s long-held commitment to free trade for fear of poking the bear. At least that is how Senator Bob Corker interpreted the outcome of the intraparty fight over how to combat Mr. Trump’s protectionist policies. “Gosh, we might poke the bear,” Mr. Corker, a Tennessee Republican who is retiring, said with fake outrage as he laced into his colleagues for disavowing their beliefs on trade because they are scared of the president and the prospect of losing power. The decision by Republican leaders this week to block a vote on Mr. Corker’s amendment to an annual defense policy bill that would have required the president to get congressional approval to impose tariffs on national security grounds was something of a watershed. Republican leaders maintained that the measure would have created procedural issues that could jeopardize the underlying defense policy bill. They privately called Mr. Corker’s reaction hyperbolic, and other Republicans said they would continue to make their differences with the president clear. But the amendment’s defeat, without a vote tallied, was a setback for a core Republican principle, and it played out in public on the Senate floor, underscoring just how far most congressional Republicans would go to avoid confronting Mr. Trump ahead of the November midterm elections. The increasingly lonely forces of opposition within the party are coming from those who are leaving politics or those in the chattering classes safely removed from a Republican electorate overwhelmingly aligned with the president. “There’s no question that leadership in general is wary of doing anything that might upset the president,” Mr. Corker said on Wednesday, describing his party’s following of Mr. Trump as “cultish.” "
312,"WASHINGTON — A former top staff member of the Senate Intelligence Committee pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to charges of lying to the F.B.I. about his contacts with reporters, and his defense lawyer accused the Justice Department and President Trump of making inappropriate comments about the case that could poison the jury pool. The former staff member, James A. Wolfe, appeared before a magistrate judge at the federal courthouse blocks from the Senate office building where he used to work. Mr. Wolfe was indicted last week on three counts of lying to F.B.I. agents working on a leak investigation, but has not been charged with unlawfully disclosing classified information. At the hearing, prosecutors told Magistrate Judge Deborah A. Robinson that they had no objections to letting him remain free for now without posting a bond, but asked for several conditions, including restricting his travel. Mr. Wolfe had surrendered his passport after he made an initial appearance this week at a courthouse in Maryland. Mr. Wolfe showed no emotion as he sat in the courtroom, occasionally rising to briefly address Judge Robinson. He left most of the speaking to one of his defense lawyers, Preston Burton, who entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf. Mr. Burton also sharply criticized government officials — including Mr. Trump — for making statements that he suggested impugned his client’s character by implying that Mr. Wolfe had illegally leaked national security secrets. Two of the three charges against Mr. Wolfe related to allegations that he told reporters nonpublic information that he had learned as a result of his role as a staff member of the Intelligence Committee. But none of the false statement charges accuse Mr. Wolfe of leaking classified information. "
313,"HOUSTON — It is unusual for the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia to see eye-to-eye, much less try to achieve common energy policy goals, even indirectly. But that is what seems to be happening, and it is taking the edge off the yearlong rise in oil and gasoline prices. Even if those countries have their own reasons for welcoming the surge in production, it is also reducing the influence of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which will meet in Vienna next week to discuss production cuts put in place in early 2017. The cheerleader, if not the ringmaster, in this effort is President Trump, who took to Twitter on Wednesday to criticize OPEC for high crude prices. “Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again,” he wrote in his second such statement since April. “Not good.” Whatever happens at the OPEC meeting, two of the biggest players in the global oil market — Saudi Arabia and Russia — appear to have already calculated that it is in their immediate interest to crank up production, effectively sidelining the Saudis’ fellow cartel members. Between them, the two countries have already each added more than 100,000 barrels a day to global oil supplies. Mr. Trump wants even more crude sloshing around the market to tamp down energy prices ahead of the congressional elections in November, and it looks like he may well get it. "

__________ Jerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, made comments on Wednesday that are likely to go down well with supporters of President Trump’s increasingly belligerent trade policies. At the news conference after the Fed’s two-day meeting, a reporter asked Mr. Powell whether the escalating trade tensions were a risk to the United States economy and whether they might be having an impact on the investment decisions of companies. Mr. Powell said Fed officials had picked up on rising concerns about trade among business executives, and he said there were reports of companies holding off on investments. But Mr. Powell seemed to go out of his way to emphasize that there was no evidence that the trade frictions were weighing on corporate behavior. He said: Of course, Mr. Powell may have gotten carried away when he gave his response. But he said more or less the same thing minutes later. Mr. Powell is probably right that economic data shows no evidence that fears of a trade war are damping activity. But top Fed officials are often more circumspect when discussing threats to the economy, especially those that could soon become real. This Friday, the Trump administration is scheduled to announce a final list of tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports, and impose them shortly after. China has said it will retaliate. "

316,"MOSCOW — Back when it sought the right to host the 2018 World Cup soccer tournament, Russia framed its bid as part of a concerted effort to transform its post-Soviet self into a modern, model global citizen. A female Olympic pole vault champion wooed the International Football Association by urging it to “help shape the future of Russia,” while a deputy prime minister said holding the championship would speed his country toward becoming “a completely different nation” whose people “will be brothers and sisters to the whole family of the world.” That was in December 2010. Then Russia proved that it harbored a rather different idea of brotherhood: annexing Crimea, backing a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine, providing the missile battery that shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 and propping up a bloody dictator, Bashar al-Assad, in Syria. Various Kremlin critics abroad died or fell ill under mysterious circumstances, while scores of activists at home were either jailed or their organizations were shuttered. Russia made “gay propaganda” illegal and weaponized social media to meddle in Western elections. In short, when President Vladimir V. Putin returned to the presidency in 2012, he abandoned the quest for admission to the global fraternity of dominant states. Instead, he contrived to seize a spot through his own devices. “We are not aspiring to be a globalized nation, that is gone,” said Vladimir Frolov, an independent foreign policy analyst, ‘‘Russia’s foreign policy strategy is to be a cat who walks by himself.” Russia still feels compelled, however, to try repeatedly to prove that it has great-power credibility. It cannot do it militarily — short of flexing its nuclear weapons — nor financially after four years of drifting in economic irons despite a recent buoyancy in oil prices. Major sporting events offer one plausible substitute, including the World Cup, which begins on Thursday. "

he dynamics of race and equality are always complicated, but for both the United States and Australia, the past, present and future continue to be shaped by how these issues are discussed and handled across society. What does self-determination look like for those who are not part of the white majority?

318,"LOS ANGELES — Antonio R. Villaraigosa was the high-riding mayor of this city for eight years. His election as its first Latino chief executive in modern times was an electrifying moment. Mr. Villaraigosa, a Democrat, has over the years expressed high ambitions for his future: a cabinet secretary in a Hillary Clinton White House. Governor of California. A next-generation leader for Latinos across the nation. But Mr. Villaraigosa saw those ambitions dashed last week in a dispiriting third-place finish in the primary for governor of California, a showing that not only eliminated him from contention for that office — but probably, as he acknowledged in a ruminative interview at his home in the Hollywood Hills on Wednesday, from elected life. He drew just 13 percent of the vote after a campaign calling for California to confront an economic divide that he warned threatened its future. It was a stunningly poor showing given the arc of his career: City Council, State Assembly, Assembly speaker, mayor, chairman of the 2012 Democratic National Convention. And it came even after charter school advocates financed a $23 million independent campaign on his behalf. “My message resonated in areas where people are struggling — it didn’t resonate where people are doing well,” Mr. Villaraigosa said, sitting at a dining room table in his home, near wraparound windows that offered views of the Hollywood sign, downtown Los Angeles, the Pacific Ocean and Griffith Park. “I understand Latinos voted two to one for me. They just didn’t come out in big numbers.” He faced, he said, considerable hurdles, some his own making, from the moment he decided to run to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown, also a Democrat. “Look, I’ve been out of office for five years,” he said, after using his phone to adjust the volume of the jazzy music coming from hidden speakers scattered around the sprawling top floor of the house. “I had never run for statewide office before. I had started at a big disadvantage.” "

Here’s the latest. 1. “There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.” That was President Trump upon his return from Singapore. In Pyongyang, the state-controlled media also celebrated the meeting’s outcome, declaring that Kim Jong-un had won major concessions. But the contours of the agreement the two leaders reached remain vague, and open to divergent interpretations.

321,"MONTREAL — Canadians were still recovering from the verbal daggers President Trump lobbed at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at last weekend’s Group of 7 summit meeting in Quebec when the news came that the newly minted frenemies would join Mexico to jointly host the 2026 World Cup. As it is, Canadians are not exactly known for their international soccer prowess; the men’s soccer team is ranked 79th in the world. And they had been digesting the incongruous image of Mr. Trump courting a North Korean dictator only hours after he had called their famously mild-mannered leader “very dishonest and weak” and a top Trump trade adviser had said “there’s a special place in hell” for Mr. Trudeau. But on Wednesday, a jubilant Mr. Trump, fresh from his meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, appeared to signal, however obliquely, that soccer could unify Canada and its erstwhile best friend. “The U.S., together with Mexico and Canada, just got the World Cup,” he wrote on Twitter. “Congratulations — a great deal of hard work!” Mr. Trudeau was equally effusive. “It’s going to be a great tournament,” he wrote on Twitter. For Canadians, by nature a forgiving people, the glamour and prestige of being host to the men’s World Cup for the first time appeared to supersede a festering trade dispute, including an acrimonious battle over the North American Free Trade Agreement, a cornerstone of trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico, which Mr. Trump has threatened to scrap. "
322,"Instead of hosannas greeting President Trump upon his return from Asia, a clash with Congress awaits him: Senators of both parties have just agreed to add language to the annual defense spending bill that would reverse his decision to save the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE. Mr. Trump, riding high off his meeting with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, is sure to fight back. He will most likely claim that he knows what he’s doing, and that internal political dissent will make him look weak at a critical moment, points that his political and media allies will surely echo. But the Senate must hold its ground: Not only does ZTE pose a unique threat to American security, but Mr. Trump’s kid-glove treatment of the company raises questions about possible links between it and Trump family businesses. It would be easy to mistake ZTE for just another player in Mr. Trump’s trade wars, and his decision to let do business again with American suppliers, in exchange for a $1 billion fine, as a tactical concession to China, which requested the deal. So it’s important to keep in mind why the United States put ZTE on a sanctions list in the first place: According to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other law enforcement officials, it violated export controls that are meant to keep American technology out of the hands of dangerous regimes, like North Korea and Iran. What’s worse, even after it was caught, ZTE resumed illegal shipments. It tried to conceal that by lying to federal investigators and its own investigators and lawyers. Moreover, the violations were, according to the Justice Department, part of an “elaborate scheme” that was approved by the company’s “the highest levels of management.” The $1 billion payment would be a bargain for ZTE and China: The company had a market capitalization of about $20 billion before the announcement in April of sanctions against it; it would have struggled and possibly even failed if the Department of Commerce had stood by its decision to deny it American components for its cellphones and other products for seven years. Thousands of jobs would have been lost in China. "
323,"To the Editor: Re “Tubman on $20 Bill? Treasury Won’t Say” (news article, June 6): The Trump Treasury’s refusal to commit to putting Harriet Tubman, a symbol of the continuing fight for civil rights, on the $20 bill is emblematic of the administration’s blatant disrespect for black women. Black women have helped lead almost every major social movement — from civil rights to women’s rights to workers’ rights to L.G.B.T.Q. rights and more — and have gone largely unrecognized for our impact. Replacing Andrew Jackson, a slave owner, with a hero who embodies the raw courage, strength and social ingenuity that happens when black women lead is the least the administration can do to amend its pattern of undermining us. Harriet Tubman, among countless other black female leaders, deserves to have her legacy honored.

324,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and signaled that two additional increases were on the way this year, as officials expressed confidence that the United States economy was strong enough for borrowing costs to rise without choking off economic growth. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, speaking in unusually blunt terms at a news conference on Wednesday, said the economy had strengthened significantly since the 2008 financial crisis and was approaching a “normal” level that could allow the Fed to soon step back and play less of a hands-on role in encouraging economic activity. The Fed’s optimism about the state of the economy is likely to translate into higher borrowing costs for cars, home mortgages and credit cards over the next year as the central bank raises interest rates more quickly than was anticipated. Wednesday’s rate increase was the second this year and the seventh since the end of the Great Recession and brings the Fed’s benchmark rate to a range of 1.75 to 2 percent. The last time the rate topped 2 percent was in late summer 2008, when the economy was contracting and the Fed was cutting rates toward zero, where they would remain for years after the financial crisis. “The decision you see today is another sign that the U.S. economy is in great shape,” Mr. Powell said after the Fed’s two-day policy meeting. “Most people who want to find jobs are finding them.” [During a news conference, Mr. Powell said he wants to “start with a plain English summary of how the economy is doing.” He certainly did that.] "
325,"WASHINGTON — In the office of Attorney General Jeff Sessions hangs a portrait of his predecessor Edwin Meese III, the Reagan-era conservative. Near the desk of the deputy attorney general is a painting of former Attorney General John Ashcroft, who pressed to expand the Justice Department’s powers after Sept. 11. The department’s inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, chose for his office a portrait of the disgraced Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty, who was nearly impeached, forced to resign in 1924 and later tried twice on charges of defrauding the government. Mr. Daugherty’s visage serves as a reminder for Mr. Horowitz: Malfeasance is never far away. Equal parts auditor, investigator and cop, Mr. Horowitz has navigated his role as one of the most powerful arbiters of conflict in Washington — the investigators’ investigator — with a diplomat’s instinct for recognizing fault lines, a prosecutor’s focus on justice and a Washington insider’s knack for amassing allies on Capitol Hill. Now, he has been thrust into the clash of law enforcement and politics that has consumed much of the capital for the past two years. On Thursday, he will issue the highly anticipated findings of his examination of the F.B.I.’s handling of its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. He is expected to castigate the decision making by the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey; his deputy, Andrew G. McCabe; and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Another high-profile test looms beyond that. Mr. Horowitz, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has begun a review of aspects of the Russia investigation. His findings could land in 2020 amid the presidential race. In interviews with nearly two dozen friends, former colleagues and political leaders, a portrait emerged of Mr. Horowitz as a principled, savvy investigator. Mr. Horowitz is good-humored and even-tempered, said past co-workers, who ribbed him for his cameos as a prosecutor on “K Street,” HBO’s short-lived 2003 show about lobbyists. He delivered lines like, “You need to have at least a general understanding of the financial flow of funds,” with the élan of a career civil servant. "
326,"For many years, Republican voters in Virginia’s affluent and highly educated Washington suburbs tended to reward mainstream candidates who could be competitive in the general election. But on Tuesday, it was Fairfax County, the population hub of the region, that delivered victory for Corey Stewart, the flame-throwing Trump acolyte who has won national attention with his paeans to Confederate emblems. Mr. Stewart narrowly defeated Nick Freitas, a state lawmaker, thanks to a decisive win in Fairfax County. And a third candidate who has also made his name as a provocateur, E.W. Jackson, carried 14 percent in the county with the third-highest median income in America. So what is happening in Fairfax? As the county has, like other high-income suburbs around the country, become more Democratic-leaning, the Republican Party has thinned out. The moderate wing of the party has dissipated, leaving a smaller and firmly conservative activist bedrock. And such voters care little about appeals to pragmatism — they are drawn to candidates who echo the president they embrace. Across four states with contested primary elections, Democratic voters embraced the candidates favored — and in some cases handpicked — by party leaders in Washington and the states, spurning insurgents who tried to align themselves with the activist left. "
327,"I
n the spring of 2006, Christopher Aaron started working 12-hour shifts in a windowless room at the Counterterrorism Airborne Analysis Center in Langley, Va. He sat before a wall of flat-screen monitors that beamed live, classified video feeds from drones hovering in distant war zones. On some days, Aaron discovered, little of interest appeared on the screens, either because a blanket of clouds obscured visibility or because what was visible — goats grazing on an Afghan hillside, for instance — was mundane, even serene. Other times, what unspooled before Aaron’s eyes was jarringly intimate: coffins being carried through the streets after drone strikes; a man squatting in a field to defecate after a meal (the excrement generated a heat signature that glowed on infrared); an imam speaking to a group of 15 young boys in the courtyard of his madrasa. If a Hellfire missile killed the target, it occurred to Aaron as he stared at the screen, everything the imam might have told his pupils about America’s war with their faith would be confirmed. The infrared sensors and high-resolution cameras affixed to drones made it possible to pick up such details from an office in Virginia. But as Aaron learned, identifying who was in the cross hairs of a potential drone strike wasn’t always straightforward. The feed on the monitors could be grainy and pixelated, making it easy to mistake a civilian trudging down a road with a walking stick for an insurgent carrying a weapon. The figures on-screen often looked less like people than like faceless gray blobs. How certain could Aaron be of who they were? “On good days, when a host of environmental, human and technological factors came together, we had a strong sense that who we were looking at was the person we were looking for,” Aaron said. “On bad days, we were literally guessing.” Initially, the good days outnumbered the bad ones for Aaron. He wasn’t bothered by the long shifts, the high-pressure decisions or the strangeness of being able to stalk — and potentially kill — targets from thousands of miles away. Although Aaron and his peers spent more time doing surveillance and reconnaissance than coordinating strikes, sometimes they would relay information to a commander about what they saw on-screen, and “60 seconds later, depending on what we would report, you would either see a missile fired or not,” he said. Other times, they would trail targets for months. The first few times he saw a Predator drone unleash its lethal payload — the camera zooming in, the laser locking on, a plume of smoke rising above the scorched terrain where the missile struck — he found it surreal, he told me. But he also found it awe-inspiring. Often, he experienced a surge of adrenaline, as analysts in the room exchanged high-fives. Aaron’s path to the drone program was unusual. He grew up in Lexington, Mass., in a home where red meat and violent video games were banned. His parents were former hippies who marched against the Vietnam War in the 1960s. But Aaron revered his grandfather, a quiet, unflappable man who served in World War II. Aaron also had a taste for exploration and tests of fortitude: hiking and wandering through the woods in Maine, where his family vacationed every summer, and wrestling, a sport whose demand for martial discipline captivated him. Aaron attended the College of William & Mary in Virginia, where he majored in history, with a minor in business. A gifted athlete with an air of independence and adventurousness, he cut a charismatic figure on campus. One summer, he traveled to Alaska alone to work as a deckhand on a fishing boat. During Aaron’s junior year, in 2001, he woke up one morning to a phone call from his father, who told him that the twin towers and the Pentagon had been attacked. Aaron thought instantly of his grandfather, who served for three years as a military police officer on the European front after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He wanted to do something similarly heroic. A year later, after spotting a pamphlet at the William & Mary career-services office for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, a national-security agency that specializes in geographical and imagery analysis, he applied for a job there. Aaron began working as an imagery analyst at the N.G.A. in 2005, studying satellite pictures of countries that had no link to the war on terror. Not long after he arrived, an email circulated about a Department of Defense task force that was being created to determine how drones could help defeat Al Qaeda. Aaron answered the call for volunteers and was soon working at the Counterterrorism Airborne Analysis Center. He found it exhilarating to participate directly in a war he saw as his generation’s defining challenge. His pride deepened as it became clear that the task force was having a significant impact and that the use of drones was increasing. "

Trump had told a reporter that he was impressed by how Kim had stepped into his father’s role as leader of North Korea at just 26. Trevor Noah issued a gentle apology and a note of congratulations.

331,"Good Wednesday. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Every media and telecom giant that’s thinking of buying a rival just got some good news. AT&T won its legal fight to be allowed to buy Time Warner — a huge blow to the Justice Department, which sought to block the deal on the grounds that consumers would suffer. The chances of approval for other media takeovers look much better now. First up will be Comcast. Expect the cable giant to challenge Walt Disney’s $52.4 billion bid for most of 21st Century Fox in the next day or two. (Michael de la Merced has outlined Fox’s antitrust concerns about a potential Comcast bid, which yesterday’s ruling is likely to have allayed.) But who else could be on the hunt for deals? John Malone, who controls both the cable company Charter and content providers like Starz; Verizon; and tech giants like Apple, Google and Amazon. Andrew says the verdict is likely to rattle President Trump, a vocal opponent of the Time Warner deal. “Mr. Trump doesn’t like to lose, and that could make his administration more reluctant to police future deals that actually deserve to be blocked,” he writes in his latest column. In a sign of financial sense, the carmaker announced that it would lay off 9 percent of its staff of 37,500. The cuts will mainly hit salaried employees and won’t affect production workers at its plant in Fremont, Calif. (That’s important, given its struggle to build enough Model 3 sedans.) "

333,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The last few decades have been full of huge corporate mergers. In one sector after another — airlines, energy, finance, media, pharmaceuticals and much more — the biggest companies have gotten bigger by buying other companies. And thanks to a court ruling Tuesday, a new round of mergers may be about to begin. Judge Richard Leon ruled that AT&T could buy Time Warner, rejecting the Justice Department’s argument that the deal would reduce competition and hurt consumers. The deal is known as a vertical merger, because it involves two companies in different areas of an industry. (A horizontal merger involves competitors.) Time Warner produces content, like shows for HBO and basketball broadcasts on TNT. AT&T distributes content, through its mobile-phone business and DirectTV. Now that Leon has approved the merger, many analysts think other vertical mergers in technology and media may follow. I was disappointed by Tuesday’s ruling, because I’m deeply concerned about the degree of corporate concentration today. I think it gives big business too much power relative to consumers, workers and the government — and it is a major reason why wage growth has been so weak in recent years, while corporate profits have soared. For a good overview of the larger issues, see this 2016 article from The Economist, as well as Gilad Edelman writing in the Washington Monthly on both the problem and the people trying to solve it. As for the AT&T merger: In The Los Angeles Times, Michael Hiltzik suggests that Comcast’s 2011 purchase of NBCUniversal is a guide to what may happen next. “The historical record bristles with evidence of the bad habits of media distribution companies given the sort of control that will soon be exercised by AT&T and Time Warner,” he writes. The Open Markets Institute, which advocates for a more competitive economy, calls the decision “a big loss for the public.” (The Atlantic has just published a profile of the institute’s Lina Khan.) And Motherboard’s Karl Bode argues that the AT&T merger is especially worrisome because of the Trump administration’s repeal of net neutrality. “We’re entering a strange new world of less oversight and greater consolidation that’s likely to leave consumers with fewer choices, less competition, and ample opportunity for creatively-bad behavior,” Bode writes. The Times editorial board explains the biggest reason to like Leon’s decision: The Trump administration appeared to oppose the merger in part because of the president’s dislike of CNN, which Time Warner owns. It would set a chilling precedent for Washington to punish media companies over their coverage. The case for Trump. The economist Tyler Cowen has produced some of the most thought-provoking semi-defenses of the Trump presidency, as I’ve written before. On his Marginal Revolution blog, Cowen has a short new piece about the North Korea summit. My colleagues Bret Stephens and Ross Douthat also weigh in on the summit. "
334,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration signaled on Wednesday that it will try to block any effort by Congress to interfere with its plan to throw a lifeline to ZTE, the Chinese technology company that the United States government has penalized for violating sanctions. The Department of Commerce brokered a settlement with ZTE this month after Chinese President Xi Jinping asked President Trump to issue a softer penalty that would not put the company out of business. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have been working on legislation that would undermine that agreement and impose a stiffer punishment on ZTE. The White House said on Wednesday that the current agreement “will ensure ZTE pays for its violations and gives our government complete oversight of their future activity without undue harm to American suppliers and their workers.” Lawmakers have been working to attach legislation on ZTE to an upcoming National Defense Authorization Act measure that is expected to pass in the Senate. Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, suggested that such a move would undermine the authority of the executive branch. “The administration will work with Congress to ensure the final N.D.A.A. conference report respects the separation of powers,” Mr. Gidley said, referencing the act. The company’s shares plunged on Wednesday, losing more than 40 percent of their value in their first day of trading on Hong Kong’s stock exchange since the United States government slapped ZTE with crippling penalties two months ago. Nearly $3 billion was shaved from the company’s market capitalization. "
335,"SINGAPORE — For America’s allies in Asia, the outcome of President Trump’s summit meeting with Kim Jong-un of North Korea has been decidedly mixed. On the good side, they no longer have to be on alert for the imminent outbreak of war on the Korean Peninsula. But the widely anticipated Trump-Kim meeting on Tuesday left them with new anxieties. Mr. Trump’s concessions to North Korea exacerbated their fears about the United States’ long-term commitment to safeguarding the region. Mr. Trump’s surprise declaration during a news conference after the meeting that he would suspend military drills between the United States and South Korea — and that he hoped eventually to pull some 28,000 American troops off the peninsula — blindsided American allies, including South Korea itself. Even the Pentagon was caught off guard. More broadly, Mr. Trump’s declaration raised questions about whether his outreach to the North actually signaled an American retreat from the region. Since World War II, the United States has been a leader in East Asia, providing security assurances to allies in Japan and South Korea. But even before engaging in talks with North Korea, Mr. Trump had questioned the merits of stationing troops in the region, and made it clear he thought the United States was paying too much to support them.

336,"SEOUL, South Korea — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that he expected “major disarmament” in North Korea within two and a half years, representing significant headway in the standoff over the country’s nuclear arsenal before the end of President Trump’s first term in office. The remarks, made during a Wednesday news conference in Seoul, South Korea, came a day after Mr. Trump met with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in the first face-to-face encounter between a sitting American president and a leader of the reclusive nation. Mr. Pompeo said the administration hoped to move quickly, but acknowledged that the denuclearization process would not be immediate. “The president has said, and it’s common knowledge, the work itself takes some amount of time,” Mr. Pompeo said. “We’re prepared to execute this once we’re in position that we can actually get to a place where we can do it.” North Korea has already spun the results of the summit in its favor, claiming it had won major concessions from the United States during its discussions with Mr. Trump. The authoritarian country’s state-controlled news media said that Mr. Trump had promised to eventually lift sanctions against the North and to end joint military drills with South Korea. It also said the United States had agreed to a phased, “step-by-step” denuclearization process for the North, rather than the immediate dismantling of its nuclear capability. "
337,"TEHRAN — A leading human rights lawyer in Iran, Nasrin Sotoudeh, was arrested on Wednesday by security forces, taken from her home in Tehran to the notorious Evin Prison, her husband said. Mrs. Sotoudeh’s persistent activism has landed her in prison numerous times, and has made her an internationally known symbol of independence in the face of Iran’s restrictive Islamist rule. Most recently, she has been involved in defending women who had been arrested for having taken off their compulsory Islamic head scarves during public protests. The arrest comes as Iran faces increasing economic pressures stemming from President Trump’s decision in May to withdraw the United States from the 2015 agreement that limited Iran’s nuclear program. He reimposed broad sanctions against Iran, putting pressure on European businesses not to do business there. Iranian hard-liners have been empowered since the judiciary, which is dominated by hard-liners, decided last week that it would allow only a pool of 20 preselected lawyers to represent those implicated in political cases. Mrs. Sotoudeh, 55, was not one of them. On Wednesday morning, Mrs. Sotoudeh’s husband, Reza Khandan, an information technology specialist, wrote on his Facebook page that she had been arrested and taken to Evin Prison. His post, written in Persian, quoted something his wife had said: “Once in the interrogation room I told the interrogators that: ‘Of all the things that the government should do for its country, you only know one, and that’s to capture people.’” He confirmed the news in a telephone interview, adding that he did not know why she had been taken. Mrs. Sotoudeh received the European Union’s most prestigious human rights award, the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 2012. Her arrest is likely to be seen as a provocation in Europe, where some countries have been trying to salvage the nuclear agreement and maintain business ties with Iran. "
338,"A judge who sentenced a Texas woman to five years in prison for voting illegally because she was a felon on probation turned down on Monday the woman’s bid for a new trial. “Prison is a lot closer for her today,” Alison Grinter, a lawyer for the woman, Crystal Mason, 43, said on Tuesday, noting that her client would appeal the decision to a higher court. Sharen Wilson, the Tarrant County district attorney, declined to comment. Ms. Mason was convicted of illegal voting in a one-day trial held March 28 before Judge Ruben Gonzalez, a state district court judge who sentenced her that day to five years in prison. She has been free on bond pending appeal. [Where do states stand on voting rights for felons? Here’s a breakdown.] Ms. Mason, who was sentenced to 60 months in jail for tax fraud and was released in early 2016, has said that she didn’t know that she wasn’t allowed to vote in that year’s presidential election. She cast a provisional ballot at her local church after being told that her name could not be found on the rolls. The ballot was never counted. “Crystal’s name was purged from the rolls when she went to prison, but Crystal did not know that,” Ms. Grinter said in an interview on Tuesday. Whether felons can vote varies state by state, and has become a contentious issue. More than six million Americans have been stripped of their voting rights because of felony disenfranchisement laws, according to the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit organization that works on criminal justice reform. Two months ago, a petition was started online to have all charges against Ms. Mason, who is black, thrown out. In the petition her photo is placed next to a photo of Terri Lynn Rote, a white woman who was convicted of voter fraud in Iowa for trying to vote for President Trump twice. Ms. Rote was sentenced to two years’ probation and a $750 fine. The petition has over 38,000 signatures. As she prepared to appeal the rejection of her motion for a new trial, Ms. Mason said she had high hopes. “I showed my kids that no matter what you can get out and get your life in order,” said Ms. Mason. “But sometimes, regardless of whatever your past is, you are still going to be beat up for it.” "
339,"Being white in America has long been treated, at least by white people, as too familiar to be of much interest. It’s been the default identity, the cultural wallpaper — something described, when described at all, using bland metaphors like milk and vanilla and codes like “cornfed” and “all-American.” Grass is green, the sky is blue and, until very recently, a product described as “nude” or “flesh-colored” probably looked like white people’s skin. How often do white people talk about being white? Not often! So long as we aren’t hanging out with white nationalists, marrying into a family of color or chuckling over jokes about our dancing, we have endless opportunities to avoid thinking much about our own race. We generally prefer to frame identity in ethnic terms instead: Identifying as Italian or Irish or Jewish seems to come with zest, pathos and a chance to take pride in some shared history. Plain undifferentiated whiteness, on the other hand, is a “toggle between nothingness and awfulness,” writes Nell Irvin Painter, an emeritus professor of history at Princeton and author of the 2010 book “The History of White People.” The Trump era, however, has compelled an unprecedented acknowledgment of whiteness as a real and alarming force. In the months leading up to the 2016 election, as Donald Trump rallied his almost entirely white base with calls for banning Muslims and deporting “bad hombres,” Politico asked: “What’s Going On With America’s White People?” The NPR podcast “Code Switch” debuted with an episode called “Can We Talk About Whiteness?” Since handing Trump 58 percent of the white vote, we have been the subject of newspaper and magazine analyses about our race-based resentment, fear of declining status and supposed economic anxiety. The satire “Dear White People” was picked up by Netflix, and the film “Get Out,” which turned self-proclaimed Obama-supporting white people into figures of horror, became the think-piece blockbuster of 2017. Suddenly it is less tenable than ever for white people to write our whiteness out of the story of race in America or define ourselves only in terms of what we are not. Much of the sharpest examination comes, as it always has, from people of color, who have spent centuries acutely aware of how the force of whiteness operates. But these days, white people are also observing one another’s whiteness with unfamiliar intensity. When a white manager at a Philadelphia Starbucks called the police to report two black customers who didn’t order right away after one had asked to use the bathroom, a white customer, Melissa DePino, tweeted video of the ensuing arrests, adding: “All the other white ppl are wondering why it’s never happened to us when we do the same thing.” A few weeks later, a white woman named Michelle Snider confronted and filmed another white woman who called the police on a couple of black men for using a charcoal grill at an Oakland park. The caller’s image became a meme, #BBQBecky, showing up on “Saturday Night Live” and being dropped into stills from “Black Panther,” Barack Obama’s inauguration and a black Last Supper. In each of these cases, as well as a string of others, white people didn’t get the usual benefit of assumed normalcy. They were portrayed, instead, as a distinct subculture with bizarre and threatening habits. “White people” were suddenly identified as the subgroup of Americans most likely to call the police on black people over a barbecue or to complain about whether every single football player stands for the anthem — stereotypes that rang true even to other white people. "
340,"SINGAPORE — President Trump’s eager embrace of Kim Jong-un of North Korea this week, on the heels of an acrid falling-out with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, raised an obvious, if confounding, question: Why would an American president offend allies and cozy up to adversaries? If there was an answer in Mr. Trump’s tumultuous week on the global stage, it may be that he disregards the traditional preoccupations of American foreign policy — power and values — in favor of a more narrow worldview shaped by his experience as a businessman. “The theme that comes up, over and over, is money,” said Jeffrey A. Bader, a diplomat who advised President Barack Obama on China. Mr. Trump’s bitter clashes with Canada and Europe over trade, as well as his solicitous courtship of North Korea’s brutal dictator, all reflect this mercantile perspective. In his transactional approach to foreign policy, considerations of financial profit or cost — often measured in ways that economists deem simplistic — can outweigh virtually any other consideration. “What that means is that Trump, like a lot of businessmen, doesn’t pay much attention to Canada, or Europe, or Japan,” Mr. Bader said. “Businessmen pay attention to the growth markets: Vietnam, Brazil, India, China.” Or, as was on vivid display in Singapore this week, North Korea. That does not mean Mr. Trump is necessarily interested in North Korea as a trade partner or an investment opportunity for the United States. But his view of the challenges posed by the Korean Peninsula are colored — and perhaps limited — by his background in business. "
341,"WASHINGTON — President Trump wasn’t on the ballot or even stateside for Tuesday’s primary elections in Virginia and South Carolina. But he loomed over both states, just as he has in nearly every nominating contest this year, underscoring how the Republican Party has become the party of Trump and that its politicians cross him at their peril. As Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina found out the hard way, in his surprise primary defeat, having a conservative voting record is less important than demonstrating total loyalty to Mr. Trump, who now enjoys higher approval ratings in his own party than any modern president except George W. Bush following the attacks of Sept. 11. And in Virginia, a far-right candidate, Corey Stewart, won the Republican Senate nomination after waging an incendiary campaign and portraying himself as a disciple of Mr. Trump. The president’s transformation of the G.O.P. — its policies, its tone, even the fate of its candidates — has never been so evident. A party that once championed free trade has now largely turned to protectionism under Mr. Trump. Sermons about inclusivity have been replaced with demagogic attacks on immigrants and black athletes. A trust-but-verify approach to foreign policy has given way to a seat-of-the-pants style in which rogue regimes like North Korea are elevated and democratic allies like Canada are belittled. Mr. Trump’s harsh attacks, including describing the news media as “the country’s biggest enemy” Tuesday, draw muted responses or silence from most Republicans these days. The party’s lawmakers have seen what he can do to their campaigns, having witnessed how Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee saw their standing with conservative voters plummet after they tangled with him. Neither is seeking re-election. While Mr. Trump has been reshaping Republican identity for nearly two years — starting with his 2016 nomination victory and the hard-line tone and platform he laid out at that summer’s Republican convention — he has never had this much opportunity to wield power over the party as he does now, including over immigration legislation and tariffs in Congress. “If you criticize him, you’re siding with the media that hates him and you’re undermining what he’s trying to accomplish,” said former Senator Rick Santorum, explaining why Mr. Trump has consolidated support. “Trump has done a good job in being a conservative president and as much as Democrats looked past what Bill Clinton said and did, Republicans are looking past what this president says and does.” "
342,"Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s longtime personal fixer, will soon be parting from the lawyers who are representing him in a potentially damaging and wide-ranging federal investigation into his business dealings, according to two people familiar with the case. Prosecutors conducting the inquiry have not yet approached Mr. Cohen to seek his cooperation, according to two people briefed on the case. But as the investigation continues, and with Mr. Cohen’s legal team in flux, the pressure on him to cooperate with the government may well intensify. Mr. Cohen’s current lawyers — a three-man team from the firm of McDermott Will & Emery — are expected to stay with him for at least the rest of the week as they struggle to complete a laborious review of a trove of documents and data files seized from their client in a series of extraordinary early-morning raids two months ago. But after that review is finished, Mr. Cohen will seek new legal counsel, the people familiar with his case said. The dispute between Mr. Cohen and his lawyers involves the payment of his legal bills, part of which are being financed by the Trump family. Mr. Cohen has also had more longstanding concerns about the lawyers: As his case moves forward, possibly toward criminal charges, he has been thinking for some time about hiring a new legal team with stronger relationships with the federal prosecutors’ office in New York that is leading the investigation, according to the people briefed on the matter. Mr. Cohen has been in the cross hairs of investigators for months, but the explosive case burst into public view on April 9 when federal agents armed with search warrants descended on his office, apartment and hotel room, hauling away eight boxes of paperwork, about 30 cellphones, iPads and computers — even the contents of one of his shredders. The materials were seized on the orders of prosecutors in Manhattan who have been trying to determine whether Mr. Cohen broke the law in any of his business projects, including hush-money payments he made to two women who claim they had affairs with Mr. Trump. The Cohen inquiry is separate from the one being run in Washington by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is looking into potential ties between Mr. Trump, his associates and Russia. But ever since the raids involving Mr. Cohen took place, Mr. Trump’s lawyers have confronted the specter that the New York-based investigation could persuade Mr. Cohen, who has a wife and two children and faces the prospect of devastating legal fees, to cut a deal and share his intimate knowledge of Mr. Trump with Mr. Mueller’s team. Mr. Cohen, after all, worked for Mr. Trump for years as a lawyer and self-described “fix-it guy,” guarding his boss’s secrets and helping him to navigate some of the most sensitive episodes in his personal and professional life. "
343,"Corey Stewart, the provocative conservative who won Tuesday’s Republican primary to challenge Democratic Senator Tim Kaine in Virginia in November, has spent years courting voters on the rightward fringes of his party, often by playing to anti-immigration sentiment. He has also been accused of supporting white nationalists, an allegation that he has denied yet may cost him support this fall even among other Republicans. One of his primary opponents, Nick Freitas, urged voters in an email last week to “reject Corey Stewart’s dog-whistling of white supremacists, anti-Semites and racists.” This argument is likely to play a major role in the general election, as signaled by the first statement from Mr. Kaine’s campaign after Mr. Stewart secured the nomination on Tuesday night. “A cruder imitation of Donald Trump who stokes white supremacy and brags about being ‘ruthless and vicious,’ Corey Stewart would be an embarrassment for Virginia in the U.S. Senate,” the statement said. Here are the facts of Mr. Stewart’s history with courting the far right. In January 2017, as Mr. Stewart ran for governor, he met with and praised Paul Nehlen, an outspoken anti-Semite who is now making his second run for Congress in Wisconsin. He called Mr. Nehlen “one of my personal heroes” and said he was “so honored” to have Mr. Nehlen’s endorsement. And in a June 2017 campaign finance filing reported by CNN, he disclosed a $759 payment to Mr. Nehlen, described as a “fund-raising commission.” [Get three key takeaways from Tuesday night’s primaries.] Mr. Stewart was also endorsed last year by the white nationalist Jason Kessler, who later organized the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. In February 2017, Mr. Stewart appeared with Mr. Kessler at an event sponsored by Mr. Kessler’s group Unity and Security for America, whose mission statement called for “defending Western civilization, including its history, culture and peoples, while utterly dismantling cultural Marxism.” Mr. Stewart has since distanced himself from both men. He told The Washington Post this month that he had praised Mr. Nehlen “before he went nuts and started spewing a bunch of stupid stuff,” and tweeted on Friday, “Paul Nehlen has lost his marbles and needs serious help.” "
344,"Between 60 and 90 percent of the world’s fresh water is frozen in the ice sheets of Antarctica, a continent roughly the size of the United States and Mexico combined. If all that ice melted, it would be enough to raise the world’s sea levels by roughly 200 feet. While that won’t happen overnight, Antarctica is indeed melting, and a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature shows that the melting is speeding up. The rate at which Antarctica is losing ice has tripled since 2007, according to the latest available data. The continent is now melting so fast, scientists say, that it will contribute six inches (15 centimeters) to sea-level rise by 2100. That is at the upper end of what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated Antarctica alone could contribute to sea level rise this century. “Around Brooklyn you get flooding once a year or so, but if you raise sea level by 15 centimeters then that’s going to happen 20 times a year,” said Andrew Shepherd, a professor of earth observation at the University of Leeds and the lead author of the study. Even under ordinary conditions, Antarctica’s landscape is perpetually changing as icebergs calve, snow falls and ice melts on the surface, forming glacial sinkholes known as moulins. But what concerns scientists is the balance of how much snow and ice accumulates in a given year versus the amount that is lost. "
345,"WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan, seeking to unite his fractious conference around a compromise immigration bill, assured Republican lawmakers during a closed-door session on Wednesday that President Trump is backing the effort, though passage of the measure next week remains very much in doubt. Wednesday’s gathering came less than 12 hours after Mr. Ryan’s office announced that the House would consider immigration next week — but not bipartisan bills prompted by a desire to protect young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. Instead, lawmakers will consider a hard-line measure that emphasizes border security and the somewhat more moderate compromise measure, yet to be finalized, that still meets Mr. Trump’s standards. Mr. Ryan’s voting plan and the unfinished compromise measure were products of weeks of tense negotiations between Republican conservatives, including hard-liners in the House Freedom Caucus, and a band of rebellious Republican moderates. But in the end, the moderates stumbled before the finish line. They had been gathering signatures for a so-called discharge petition that would have forced Mr. Ryan to bring two bipartisan bills to the floor, but the effort collapsed two signatures short of the number needed. “It’s not my ideal place to be,” said Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, one of 23 Republicans who signed the petition. “My ideal option would be a bipartisan bill in the House. But it’s the cards that we were dealt, and I think we’re trying to make good use of these cards.” The compromise bill will be built around four principles — Mr. Trump has called them the “four pillars” — that the president has insisted any immigration bill contain: a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers; beefed-up border security, including $25 billion for the wall the president wants to build on the southwest border; an end to the current diversity visa lottery system, which is aimed at bringing in immigrants from underrepresented nations; and limits on family-based migration, known as chain migration. Mr. Ryan told reporters that the “last thing I want to do is bring a bill out of here that I know the president won’t support.” "
346,"TEHRAN — After the handshakes, the signature ceremony and the diplomatic pomp of the historic meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un of North Korea, many Iranians could come to only one conclusion: We should talk, too. Yes, Mr. Trump in May unilaterally pulled the United States out of the nuclear agreement between Iran and a group of world powers. Yes, he has imposed new sanctions against Iran that are scaring away European investors. Yes, Mr. Trump has a long track record of changing his mind. Despite that, some here say that perhaps Iran’s leaders should make a move similar to Mr. Kim’s and propose a meeting. If Mr. Trump can sit down with the leader of such an isolated country, with its gulags, summary executions and stockpile of nuclear weapons and intercontinental missiles, why not talk to Iran? Mr. Trump has already said he is willing to authorize direct talks with Iran’s leaders to renegotiate the Iran deal. “We are a country with municipal, parliamentary and presidential elections, our 80-million-strong society is open and dynamic, we share borders” with many countries, said Masoud Daneshmand, a member of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce. “Iran is a much more advanced and open society, compared with North Korea. So why wouldn’t Iran and America be able to sit down and have direct talks?” One reason is that Iran’s leaders are ideologically opposed to talking to the United States. Like North Korea, Iran has no diplomatic relations with the United States. Iranian presidents visiting the United Nations for meetings have been known to duck into a restroom to avoid being seen with an American president. "
347,"Any ideology operating under the seismic pressures of the actual world will reveal a seam of inconsistency, a line of vulnerability running through it like a stress fracture. Free-market conservatives, for instance, have tried to square their support for big business with their professed fondness for little communities, sometimes by suggesting that the interests of both are one and the same. Eliza Griswold will tell you what happens when they’re not. Scratch that: Eliza Griswold will show you what happens when they’re not. Her sensitive and judicious new book, “Amity and Prosperity: One Family and the Fracturing of America,” is neither an outraged sermon delivered from a populist soapbox nor a pinched, professorial lecture. Griswold, a journalist and a poet, paid close attention to a community in southwestern Pennsylvania over the course of seven years to convey its confounding experience with hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a process that injects water and chemicals deep into the ground in order to shake loose deposits of natural gas. Considering the animus and hardship described in this book, the title sounds almost cruelly ironic, but it comes from the land itself. Amity and Prosperity are the names of two towns in Pennsylvania’s Washington County, where “the history of energy extraction is etched into Appalachian hollows.” The people there are no strangers to industry, including its boons and disasters. Coal, steel and now natural gas: To suggest that the county’s residents have just been bamboozled by greedy industry sounds to them like the bleating of condescending elites and, for a number of locals, simply untrue. Some families have suffered while others have thrived. What Griswold depicts is a community, like the earth, cracked open. Griswold arrived on the scene in 2011, a little more than halfway through the decade of the gas rush, when technological advances made fracking cheaper — economically speaking, that is. The ecological costs have proved to be quite dear. Natural gas may burn more cleanly than oil or coal, but flushing it out requires forcing enormous amounts of water and chemicals into the earth with pressure approaching a shotgun blast. (Oklahoma and Pennsylvania have had fracking-related earthquakes as a result.) Then there’s the grim matter of the waste left over, what one candid extraction employee calls “demon water.” Griswold describes sludge in a waste pond going septic, releasing an unbearable stench “like an infected wound.” “It was the kind of fugitive scent that made Stacey feel paranoid and alone,” Griswold writes of Stacey Haney, a nurse who leased her mineral rights to Range Resources in 2008. Haney thought the money would help her and her two children, whom she was raising on her own after a divorce. Stacey tries to counter the odor with spritzings of Febreze and a steady supply of potpourri. Parts of “Amity and Prosperity” read as intimately as a novel, though its insidious, slow-motion ordeal is all too real. "

349,"Dear Robert De Niro, Samantha Bee and other Trump haters: I get that you’re angry. I’m angry, too. But anger isn’t a strategy. Sometimes it’s a trap. When you find yourself spewing four-letter words, you’ve fallen into it. You’ve chosen cheap theatrics over the long game, catharsis over cunning. You think you’re raising your fist when you’re really raising a white flag. You’re right that Donald Trump is a dangerous and deeply offensive man, and that restraining and containing him are urgent business. You’re wrong about how to go about doing that, or at least you’re letting your emotions get the better of you. When you answer name-calling with name-calling and tantrums with tantrums, you’re not resisting him. You’re mirroring him. You’re not diminishing him. You’re demeaning yourselves. Many voters don’t hear your arguments or the facts, which are on your side. They just wince at the din. You permit them to see you as you see Trump: deranged. Why would they choose a different path if it goes to another ugly destination? Of course this is broader than De Niro, bigger than Bee and about more than profanity. It’s about maturity, pragmatism and plain old smarts — and the necessity of all three when the stakes are this high. Many Democrats get that. Maybe even most do. In the primaries last week and on Tuesday, Democratic voters by and large chose House candidates whose appeals were tempered and whose profiles make them formidable general-election contenders. They’re the best bets for wooing less fiercely partisan voters and snatching seats currently in Republican hands. "
350,"MANASSAS, Va. — He once stood proudly before a Confederate flag, declaring it was not a symbol of hatred, but “about our heritage.” After the march of torch-carrying white supremacists in Charlottesville last year, which led to the death of a counterprotester, he criticized “weak Republicans” who “couldn’t apologize fast enough.” As officials around Virginia have grappled with whether to remove Confederate statues, he has compared those politicians to leaders of the Islamic State.

352,"WASHINGTON — A much-anticipated report about the F.B.I.’s handling of its investigation into Hillary Clinton was scheduled to be released on Thursday, and few were looking forward to it more than President Trump. Here are the big outstanding questions, and what to look for. This has become the most important question of the report, and it is one that the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, did not even set out to answer. He began his investigation last year to scrutinize the actions of the F.B.I. director at the time, James B. Comey, and his deputy, Andrew G. McCabe. But Mr. Trump has pushed a theory that a secret cabal of Mrs. Clinton’s supporters inside the F.B.I. conspired to clear her of wrongdoing over her handling of classified information. This same group of agents, Mr. Trump argues, then cooked up a phony investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia as a way to undermine his presidency. No public evidence has surfaced to prove this theory, and the inspector general is unlikely to claim a wide-ranging political conspiracy at the heart of the F.B.I. There is evidence that at least some agents on the Clinton investigation disliked Mr. Trump. But look for Mr. Trump to seize on aspects of the report that support him, and probably discard those that do not. Mrs. Clinton’s supporters find this entire argument baffling. It was Mr. Comey, after all, who chastised her at a nationally televised news conference, and then — over the objection of the Justice Department — announced just days before Election Day that the F.B.I. was again investigating Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Trump now says the F.B.I. was on her side all along. "
353,"In one of the closest presidential elections in American history, anything and everything could have been decisive. But we’ll probably never know what really was. The letter about Hillary Clinton’s emails that the F.B.I. director James Comey sent to Congress in October 2016 is one of these potential factors. Mrs. Clinton herself told Fareed Zakaria on CNN last fall that she “would have won but for Jim Comey’s letter on October 28th.” But as the Department of Justice concluded its report into Mr. Comey’s handling of the investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s email server on Thursday, it is still unclear whether this letter cost her the presidency. Mr. Comey’s letter came about one week after the third presidential debate and less than two weeks before Election Day. At that time, most polling averages showed Mrs. Clinton ahead by around six percentage points in national polls. A week later,  her lead had declined to three points. The three-point shift against her is often attributed to Mr. Comey’s letter — three points being more than enough to cover Donald J. Trump’s narrow margins in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. He won each state by less than 0.8 percentage points. Late-deciding voters broke overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump, the exit polls showed, and the Comey letter and its disclosure of new information in the email investigation was a significant part of the news coverage over the last week of the election.

354,"To the Editor: Re “American Strikes Killed Nearly 500 Civilians in ’17” (news article, June 2): The Pentagon’s account of civilians killed by American military action is unreliable. One reason, alluded to in the article, is the blackout on civilian casualty figures for countries in which the United States conducts strikes in secret. And there are many. While the Trump administration lists seven countries in which the United States has used or is using military force, Special Operations Command has admitted that halfway through 2017, its forces had already been deployed to 137 countries. Another reason, rarely mentioned, is in the definition of the word “civilian.” The Pentagon seems to use the term to mean “whomever we didn’t intend to kill” rather than “what the law requires.” This excludes people it wrongly intended to kill because of bad intelligence, false presumptions of combatant status and, most egregiously, because the United States wrongly applies law-of-war rules for killing in places where the United States is not at war. GABOR RONA, NEW YORK The writer is a visiting professor at Cardozo Law School. "
355,"The Department of Justice’s independent watchdog, the inspector general, has released a report that is critical of my decisions as F.B.I. director during the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email account. The report concludes that I was wrong to announce the F.B.I.’s completion of the investigation without coordinating with the attorney general and that I was wrong to inform Congress in late October that we had reopened the investigation. In both situations, the inspector general’s team concludes, I should have adhered to established norms, which they see as mandating both deference to the attorney general on the public announcement and silence about an investigation so close to an election. I do not agree with all of the inspector general’s conclusions, but I respect the work of his office and salute its professionalism. All of our leaders need to understand that accountability and transparency are essential to the functioning of our democracy, even when it involves criticism. This is how the process is supposed to work. This report is important for two reasons. First, the inspector general’s team went through the F.B.I.’s work with a microscope and found no evidence that bias or improper motivation affected the investigation, which I know was done competently, honestly and independently. The report also resoundingly demonstrates that there was no prosecutable case against Mrs. Clinton, as we had concluded. Although that probably will not stop some from continuing to claim the opposite is true, this independent assessment will be useful to thoughtful people and an important contribution to the historical record. Second, this report is vital in shedding light for future leaders on the nature and quality of our investigation and the decisions we made. "
356,"Footage of President Trump saluting a top North Korean general during this week’s summit meeting with the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, set off debate on Thursday over military and diplomatic protocol. The scene was part of a 42-minute documentary that aired on state television two days after the two leaders met in Singapore, offering another window into the historic encounter. While greeting North Korean dignitaries after his initial handshake with Mr. Kim, Mr. Trump proceeded down the line shaking hands, the video shows. When Mr. Trump offered his hand to Gen. No Kwang-chol, who was recently promoted to defense chief, the general saluted instead. Mr. Trump quickly raised his own hand and saluted back. Maj. Gen. Paul Eaton, a retired United States Army general, criticized the gesture in a statement. “It is wholly inappropriate for the commander in chief of our armed forces to salute the military of our adversary, especially one which is responsible for a regime of terror, murder and unspeakable horror against its own people,” General Eaton said. Others pointed out that with North and South Korea still technically at war (a formal peace treaty was never signed), it was inappropriate for Mr. Trump to salute the general of an adversary. "
357,"LOS ANGELES — Drawing on an American history of cruelty, from the conquest of the Indians to the slave trade to the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, activists in this city gathered on Thursday to voice outrage at what they see as the latest affront to American values by the Trump administration: splitting up migrant families at border crossings, and confining children in detention facilities. “I think we are fighting for the heart and soul of America,” Yolanda Varela Gonzalez, a teacher and activist, told a crowd of several hundred protesters in MacArthur Park, before they marched to an immigrant detention center in downtown Los Angeles. From the start, the Trump administration’s hard line on immigration has galvanized this city of immigrants, where nearly half the population is Latino, and where deportations and roundups of undocumented immigrants by government agents has spread fear and anger in immigrant neighborhoods. And the stories they have heard lately, and the images they have seen, of children being ripped from the arms of parents at the border have heightened a sense of outrage, a sense that they are experiencing an era of American history that will be looked back upon with shame. “Taking kids from their parents is crossing a line,” said Gale Chernich, who joined the protest in Los Angeles. Demonstrators in Los Angeles were joined by activists in dozens of other cities across the country on Thursday evening to protest the separation of migrant families under President Trump’s zero-tolerance crackdown on illegal immigration, enacted in May. Organizers said more than 5,000 people had signed up to join the Families Belong Together rallies, aimed at halting one of the most widely debated new fronts in the Trump administration’s campaign to slow the flow of migrants across the southwest border from Mexico and Central America. "
358,"RIGA, Latvia — A trade war with the United States looms. Populists have taken power in Italy, posing a new threat to the euro. Growth is sluggish, and there is even talk of another banking crisis. It would not seem the ideal time to put the brakes on Europe’s economy. But that is what the European Central Bank is preparing to do. For more than a decade, the central bank unleashed a wave of cash to stimulate growth, effectively saving Europe from the wrenching consequences of its debt crisis. The bank said Thursday that the era of easy money was over, and outlined plans to completely remove its support by December. In essence, the bank is declaring the region cured, or at least strong enough to stand on its own. It is signaling that it doesn’t want to be in the business of saving politicians from themselves or responding to every dip in growth with a new dose of stimulus. And it is under pressure to remain in sync with a crucial trading partner after the United States Federal Reserve raised its main interest rate on Wednesday. What will happen next is uncertain, because the European Central Bank has pumped unprecedented amounts of money into the economy. There may be unpleasant surprises: think real estate bubbles, more wobbling banks or a surge in bankruptcies. “It’s not the right time,” said Zsolt Darvas, a monetary policy expert at Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels. “If you look at what happened in the last few quarters, everything became more disappointing.” "
359,"ATLANTA — The leading Republican candidate in Georgia’s high-profile governor’s race, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, bought a condominium in downtown Atlanta 10 years ago from a State Capitol lobbyist, seemingly at a discount, a New York Times investigation has found. Real estate records show that Mr. Cagle, who faces a runoff for the Republican nomination on July 24, purchased the one-bedroom apartment at 24 percent less than its appraised value — below comparable sales prices — and sold it last year at a 29 percent profit. He was preparing for his first run for governor when, without an agent, he negotiated the deal with Terry E. Hobbs, a longtime lobbyist who represents the natural gas marketer Scana. As lieutenant governor, Mr. Cagle presides over the Senate and controls the flow of legislation there. The direct financial transaction between him and a lobbyist with business before the government raises ethical questions comparable to those afflicting Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator. News reports in April revealed that Mr. Pruitt last year rented a Washington condo at a bargain rate from the wife of a lobbyist with clients seeking audiences with E.P.A. officials. The arrangement is being investigated by the agency’s inspector general. Sara Henderson, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, a government watchdog group, said that such cozy relationships raised suspicions of pay-to-play. “Lobbyists and elected officials should never be involved in business deals together,” she said. “It gives the impression that the lobbyist and their interests will find favor with that official when it comes to awarding contracts and determining public policy that might financially benefit them.” In a telephone interview on Tuesday night, Mr. Cagle said that the deal did not show bad judgment, and that Mr. Hobbs had not lobbied him on any issue near the time of the sale. "
360,"A much-anticipated inspector general’s report about the F.B.I.’s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton released on Thursday found that the former director James B. Comey was “insubordinate,” but it did not challenge the decision not to charge Mrs. Clinton and did not conclude that bias influenced that choice. The Justice Department’s inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, criticized several aspects of the federal investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Among them were a decision by Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch to meet former President Bill Clinton on an airport tarmac; the move by Mr. Comey to publicly say the bureau was recommending no charges while also condemning Mrs. Clinton’s conduct in detail; and Mr. Comey’s disclosure that the F.B.I. had reopened the investigation after finding new evidence to examine, and his re-closing of it days before the 2016 presidential election. [Read our coverage on the report.] Mr. Horowitz is also investigating the department’s handling of the Russia investigation, which President Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have sought to portray as scandalous. While several of the same officials were involved in both inquiries, the new report focused only on the Clinton investigation. Here are the highlights that our reporters compiled as they read the report. Mr. Comey made a “conscious decision” not to tell the Justice Department about holding a news conference in July 2016, according to the report. During the event, Mr. Comey announced that the F.B.I. would not recommend criminal charges in the Clinton investigation. The report found that it was “extraordinary and insubordinate for Comey to do so, and we found none of his reasons to be a persuasive basis for deviating from well-established department policies in a way intentionally designed to avoid supervision by department leadership over his actions.” "
361,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Investigations rattle Washington, some clarity on North Korea and fiscal reform in Malaysia. Here’s what you need to know: • Two major investigations grabbed U.S. headlines. A Justice Department report concluded that James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, was “insubordinate” in his unorthodox handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Comey, in an Op-Ed, disputed some of the report’s conclusions, but embraced its existence as “good for the F.B.I.” Above, he spoke in Canada last week. And the New York State attorney general’s office filed a scathingly worded lawsuit against Mr. Trump’s charitable foundation, accusing it and the Trump family of sweeping violations of campaign finance laws, self-dealing and illegal coordination with the presidential campaign. Mr. Trump reacted with vitriol, calling the civil suit an attempt by the “sleazy New York Democrats” to damage him. Here are the basics of the case. _____ "
362,"WASHINGTON — New texts released Thursday by the Justice Department’s inspector general show that the F.B.I. agent overseeing the investigation into President Trump’s campaign pledged to stop Mr. Trump from becoming president. “[Trump’s] not ever going to become president, right?” asked a top F.B.I. lawyer, Lisa Page, in one text. “Right?!” Peter Strzok, the agent overseeing the F.B.I.’s investigation into links between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia, answered, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The exchange, in August 2016, came shortly after the investigation into Russian tampering with the election began. The Justice Department inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, said that the texts raise significant questions about the F.B.I.’s credibility during a politically delicate investigation, but he said that he found no evidence that the agents’ political views affected the inquiry. Nevertheless, Mr. Trump’s allies seized on the texts to further their contention that a “Deep State” embedded in the federal government had started the investigation into links between the president’s campaign and Russia to take him down. "
363,"Democrats sharply criticized the nation’s top bank regulator, Joseph M. Otting, during hearings before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, a day after he answered a question about the existence of lending or housing discrimination by saying he had never personally “observed” it. Mr. Otting, a longtime bank executive who is close to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, pulled back on his previous comments, telling senators that while he had not personally experienced discrimination, he does believe that it exists. But he went considerably further, distancing himself from other Trump administration officials who have publicly and privately rejected the idea that racial, ethnic and gender prejudice is an endemic part of the nation’s housing and banking systems. Under intense questioning before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, Mr. Otting, the comptroller of the currency, said that “I have personally never observed” housing discrimination, adding, “Many of my friends from the inner city across America will tell me that it is evident today.” He also said that “half” of the stories written about discrimination were not to be believed — before remarking that he did not read newspapers and watched only CNBC and ESPN. That incensed members of the House committee, and, on Thursday, senators pressed Mr. Otting on his comments. “Are you sitting before this committee telling a Hispanic American that there is no discrimination in mortgage lending?” asked Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who is the son of Cuban immigrants. "
364,"— Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, to reporters on Thursday. — Speaker Paul D. Ryan, at a news conference on Thursday. Hundreds of migrant children have been separated from their parents at the border since October, but there is no decades-old law or court decision that requires this.   Ms. Sanders, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Grassley are referring to a class-action lawsuit that was initially brought against the Reagan administration, as Flores v. Meese, and settled under the Clinton administration in 1997, as Flores v. Reno. The Flores settlement required immigration officials to “place each detained minor in the least restrictive setting appropriate” — for example, providing food, water and toilets. The government also agreed to release immigrant children “without unnecessary delay” under an established preference ranking for custody. After a surge of families from Central America began arriving at the United States’ southwestern border in 2014, the Obama administration opened family detention centers. That prompted more lawsuits, which argued that doing so had breached the Flores settlement by not releasing children swiftly. In 2016, the Ninth Circuit of Appeals ruled that the Flores settlement “unambiguously applies both to minors who are accompanied and unaccompanied by their parents.” It also overturned a Federal District Court’s decision that the government must also release the parents. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a “zero tolerance” policy in April, stating that “our goal is to prosecute every case that is brought to us” — thus leading to the detention of migrant parents.   In other words, without the Trump administration’s new enforcement policy, the Flores settlement — and subsequent rulings clarifying its scope — alone would not have caused family separation at the border. As The New York Times reported last month: Under Flores, the government has three options: releasing families together, passing a law that would allow for family detention or breaking up the families. The Trump administration has so far chosen the third option. "
365,"WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, is expected on Friday to send President Trump a detailed legal proposal to dramatically scale back an Obama-era regulation on water pollution, according to a senior E.P.A. official familiar with the plan. It is widely expected to be one of his agency’s most significant regulatory rollback efforts. And, as soon as Monday, the same official said, Mr. Pruitt is expected to publish another major change: his agency’s legal proposal to gut President Barack Obama’s rule to reduce climate-warming pollution from vehicle tailpipes. That proposal risks triggering a court battle with California and raises the prospect that the American car market could be split in two, with different groups of states enforcing different pollution rules. Mr. Pruitt’s two moves come as he is dogged by allegations of legal and ethical violations and is seeking to burnish his reputation in the eyes of his boss, the president. While Mr. Pruitt has initiated the rollback of dozens of environmental rules over the past year and a half, the latest one-two push comes as he is battling allegations that he improperly used his government post to secure a job for his wife. This week, the chorus of critics calling for Mr. Pruitt’s resignation swelled to include the conservative National Review, which once championed his appointment. And on Wednesday, Mr. Pruitt’s onetime political mentor, Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, told the conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham that Mr. Pruitt needed to move past his management blunders and that it may be “time for him to go.” The weakening of the water and tailpipe-pollution regulations have been top priorities for Mr. Trump since he took office. The release of a new water regulation to replace the Obama-era rule, known as Waters of the United States, would hand a victory to two important groups for the president: farmers and rural landowners (who make up his political base), as well as golf-course and real estate developers. The Trump Organization, the Trump family’s real estate conglomerate, itself owns more than a dozen golf resorts in the United States. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment on the potential for Mr. Trump’s business interests to benefit from the potential changes. "
366,"WASHINGTON — As deputy attorney general during the George W. Bush administration, James B. Comey clashed repeatedly with the White House over its interrogation and warrantless wiretapping programs, earning a reputation of fighting for his view of what was right no matter whom he angered. That same impulse — that he knew best, no matter the consequences — underpinned Mr. Comey’s decisions in 2016 to flout Justice Department norms and update the public on the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s handling of classified information. Democrats have said he cost her the presidential election. Mr. Comey was faulted for those decisions in a highly critical Justice Department report released on Thursday about the F.B.I.’s handling of the Clinton inquiry. By trying to protect the bureau, the department’s inspector general found, Mr. Comey instead damaged the F.B.I.’s reputation. “Comey chose to deviate from the F.B.I.’s and the department’s established procedures and norms and instead engaged in his own subjective, ad hoc decision making,” the report said. It added, “The decisions negatively impacted the perception of the F.B.I. and the department as fair administrators of justice.” An official condemnation of Mr. Comey’s go-it-alone approach, the report is bound to shape his legacy, providing grist for both Republicans and Democrats as well as F.B.I. agents who disagreed with how he ran the bureau at a politically perilous time. Mr. Comey defended his decisions and said the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, had the benefit of hindsight. While Mr. Comey supported the review, he disagreed with its conclusions. "
367,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “I do not agree with all of the inspector general’s conclusions, but I respect the work of his office.” That was James Comey, in an Op-Ed for The Times, after a Justice Department report found that he was “insubordinate” in his handling of the Clinton investigation during the 2016 election. Above, Mr. Comey speaking in Canada last week. The report does not challenge the decision not to prosecute Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server to store classified information. Nor does it conclude that political bias at the F.B.I. influenced that decision. Nevertheless, it paints an unflattering picture of one of the F.B.I.’s most tumultuous periods, which included the start of the investigation into the Trump campaign’s connections to Russia. Here are the highlights of the 500-page report. ____ "
368,"One of the lessons of a life in journalism is that people are always way more complicated than you think. We talk in shorthand about “Trump voters” or “social justice warriors,” but when you actually meet people they defy categories. Someone might be a Latina lesbian who loves the N.R.A. or a socialist Mormon cowboy from Arizona. Moreover, most actual human beings are filled with ambivalences. Most political activists I know love parts of their party and despise parts of their party. A whole lifetime of experience, joy and pain goes into that complexity, and it insults their lives to try to reduce them to a label that ignores that. Yet our culture does a pretty good job of ignoring the uniqueness and depth of each person. Pollsters see in terms of broad demographic groups. Big data counts people as if it were counting apples. At the extreme, evolutionary psychology reduces people to biological drives, capitalism reduces people to economic self-interest, modern Marxism to their class position and multiculturalism to their racial one. Consumerism treats people as mere selves — as shallow creatures concerned merely with the experience of pleasure and the acquisition of stuff. Back in 1968, Karol Wojtyla wrote, “The evil of our times consists in the first place in a kind of degradation, indeed in a pulverization, of the fundamental uniqueness of each human person.” That’s still true. So this might be a perfect time for a revival of personalism. Personalism is a philosophic tendency built on the infinite uniqueness and depth of each person. Over the years people like Walt Whitman, Martin Luther King, William James, Peter Maurin and Wojtyla (who went on to become Pope John Paul II) have called themselves personalists, but the movement is still something of a philosophic nub. It’s not exactly famous. Personalism starts by drawing a line between humans and other animals. Your dog is great, but there is a depth, complexity and superabundance to each human personality that gives each person unique, infinite dignity. "
369,"BROWNSVILLE, Tex. — Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. I wasn’t sure what to expect as I walked from the security guard post to the biggest migrant children’s shelter in the country on Wednesday. The site, a former Walmart Supercenter, rose before me in the late-afternoon South Texas heat. I’ve been in both prisons and immigrant detention centers before. In 2012, I toured Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, where unaccompanied youths apprehended at the border were being housed temporarily. But I could not visualize what was inside this old Walmart: an indoor tent city, perhaps, with rows of cots and folding chairs? The mystery was heightened by the experience of Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, who tried but failed to get a tour and live-streamed every moment on Facebook Live. What, many asked, were they hiding? After spending roughly 90 minutes inside the shelter on Wednesday as part of a media tour, the answer was simple: nothing suspicious at all. But the brief visit raised more questions than it answered. The shelter, known as Casa Padre, was clean and orderly. The children — nearly 1,500 migrant boys aged 10 to 17, most of them from Central America — were well fed and well supervised. “Buenas tardes,” several of the teenagers told me, smiling. Nothing was out of place in Bedroom 53, one of more than 300. A picture posted on the wall appeared to show the children how their beds should be made. The boys’ clog-style shoes were placed neatly next to the beds, awaiting lights out at 9 p.m. "
370,"Democrats have yearned for a moment of political exoneration ever since Hillary Clinton’s defeat in 2016. They have looked to Russian interference in the campaign, claims of bias in the media and allegations of Republican lawbreaking to explain an upset that few in the party foresaw. Perhaps most of all, Democrats have vented indignation at the F.B.I. and its former director, James B. Comey, for reviving the issue of Hillary Clinton’s private email server in the last days of the race. On Thursday, Clinton supporters won a powerful kind of validation from the unlikeliest source: President Trump’s Department of Justice. The inspector general’s report criticizing Mr. Comey for his flamboyant handling of the Clinton investigation sent an angry thrill through the ranks of Democrats and Mrs. Clinton’s allies. Michael E. Horowitz, an investigator not appointed by Mr. Trump, concluded that Mr. Comey had twice breached the bureau’s traditional discretion: first by holding a July news conference to announce he would not charge Mrs. Clinton with mishandling classified information, and then later sending a letter to Congress disclosing that the agents were scrutinizing new evidence in the matter. [The report is 500 pages. Our experts broke it down.] In many respects, those findings mirrored Democrats’ own assessments of Mr. Comey — save for the omission of certain four-letter words. But if the report appeared to validate their grievances against Mr. Comey, it offered scant relief to Clinton loyalists. For some of them, it intensified the agony of Mr. Trump’s surprise win — cementing Democratic suspicions about the fairness of his election, but leaving them without recourse to address them. "
371,"The new report from the Justice Department’s watchdog covers a lot of ground. It runs more than 500 pages and evaluates investigations that touch both President Trump and Hillary Clinton. As a result, some of the initial news coverage — which has to cram all of the big findings into a few paragraphs — can be a little difficult to follow. If you’re trying to do so, I recommend keeping your focus on the big picture. The report addresses one question that’s more important than any other: Did the Justice Department and F.B.I. use their power, as Trump has repeatedly claimed, to help Clinton’s campaign and hurt his? In the lead-up to the report, Trump’s allies agreed that this was paramount. “The central question in my opinion,” David Bossie, Trump’s former deputy campaign manager, wrote this week on the Fox News website, “is did Hillary Clinton and her cronies get preferential treatment in her email server investigation for political reasons?” And the report’s answer is clear: No. Federal investigators and prosecutors did not give preferential treatment to Clinton. They pursued the case on the merits. They were guided by, as the inspector general’s report puts it, “the prosecutor’s assessment of the facts, the law, and past Department practice.” The most significant mistake in the investigation didn’t help Clinton. It hurt her, badly. It was James Comey’s decision to violate department policy and talk publicly about the investigation. If it weren’t for that decision, the polling data suggests Clinton would be president. Now that the report has been released, Trump and his allies are trying to confuse people about what it actually said. The White House and loyal media organizations like Fox News are mixing the report’s subjects to make it sound much better for Trump than it really is. And more serious news coverage often struggles to find clear enough language to explain the bait and switch, without seeming to lose its objectivity. "
372,"To the Editor: Re “On Father’s Day, Skip the Politics,” by Margaret Renkl (Op-Ed, June 11): I cannot imagine not loving someone in my family because of politics. Perhaps that is because politics never seems to separate us very much. We think virtually alike on the subject. But then I have sometimes thought what it must have been like when relatives, even brothers, fought on opposite sides of the Civil War, and perhaps even pointed guns at each other. While I never had major political squabbles with my father, my father-in-law was a pretty conservative guy, which led to many spirited political discussions. However, he was always fair-minded, well-meaning, generous and a far better person than I have been or ever will be. Of course, while he liked H. Ross Perot back in the day, I don’t know how he would have felt about Donald Trump. But it would not have mattered to me. That much I know. So by all means leave the politics behind this Father’s Day, and most every day when it comes to family and close friends. It works most of the time. BRUCE NEUMAN, WATER MILL, N.Y. To the Editor: What a beautiful article. Thank you, Margaret Renkl, for sharing such a thoughtful reminder that people are much more than their political opinions. If we allow the polarizing and poisoning to seep into our relationships with family and friends, we may we compound our grief over political upheaval as we find ourselves grieving the loss of cherished relationships. Your father-in-law showed a great deal of wisdom in suggesting you write an article about him and how you still love him despite his support for President Trump. CAROL LYNAUGH, CHESTER, N.J. To the Editor: Nonsense!! People who voted for Donald Trump deserve to be banned from polite society. Actions have consequences. Elections certainly do. TAMAR SINGER, NEW YORK "
373,"RIGA, Latvia — The European Central Bank took a major step on Thursday toward winding down life support for the eurozone economy. Meeting in Riga, the Latvian capital, the central bank’s Governing Council said it would slow its purchases of government and corporate bonds in September, and then end the program entirely at the end of the year. The stimulus was essentially a form of money printing known as quantitative easing that helped prevent the eurozone from collapsing under the strain of a debt crisis. The bank said it did not expect to raise interest rates, which are at historic lows, until the fall of 2019 at the earliest. Mario Draghi, the central bank’s president, also held out the possibility that policymakers could still ramp up stimulus if needed. The bank had not been expected to lay out so clearly its road map for the months ahead. The mere fact that the topic of reducing the stimulus program was on the agenda was significant. The shift away from a decade of extraordinarily easy money will be a delicate one — as the Federal Reserve, which raised its benchmark interest rate in the United States by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, has learned to its peril. In 2013, the Fed provoked a global sell-off of riskier investments when it announced that it would begin scaling back its quantitative easing program. "
374,"It may be hard to believe that this is happening in the United States in 2018, that hundreds of children are being snatched from their parents, frequently under false pretenses, often screaming, and placed in vast warehouselike centers like the former Walmart in Brownsville, Tex., where nearly 1,500 boys now spend their days. The parents often don’t know where their children are, or when they will see them again. In 2014 the Obama administration detained hundreds of families and unaccompanied minors crossing the border, a practice that the federal courts quickly curtailed. But separating families as a matter of unofficial policy is something new and malicious, a function of President Trump’s obsession with undocumented immigrants. This spring, the administration ordered that everyone caught crossing illegally into the United States be prosecuted. And since children cannot accompany grown-ups to jail, people who had crossed illegally with children had their children taken away. Hundreds upon hundreds of children, of all ages, creating a new industry in mass shelters. The United Nations human rights office called this new practice a serious violation of the rights of children and demanded an immediate halt. Catholic bishops denounced it as immoral. The American Psychological Association warned that the separations threatened the mental and physical health of the children. All to no avail. The administration has come back with a mix of just-following-orders and falsehoods. The Department of Homeland Security said it had no policy for separating families; it was just catching criminals. President Trump feigned sympathy for the separations but claimed he was the victim of “bad legislation passed by the Democrats,” which nobody could find. Only John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, offered what appeared to be a plausible, if shocking, explanation: that separating parents from their children could be a “tough deterrent.” The heartlessness of that is mind-boggling. It seems to elude the administration and its cheerleaders that this is not about crime or security, but about the most elemental human values; that ordering armed border guards to cruelly and needlessly rip children from mothers — in one case, while she was breast-feeding the child — goes against fundamental American values and undercuts its standing in the world. "
375,"On Thursday, the New York State attorney general sued the Donald J. Trump Foundation, charging it with “improper and extensive political activity, repeated and willful self-dealing transactions, and failure to follow basic fiduciary obligations or to implement even elementary corporate formalities required by law.” The lawsuit follows years of scrutiny of President Trump’s charitable activities and adds to the president’s extensive legal challenges, amid a continuing investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Trump established the Donald J. Trump Foundation in 1987, when he was a New York City real estate mogul, with the stated mission of collecting and maintaining money “exclusively for charitable, religious, scientific, literary or educational purposes,” either directly or by donating to other organizations. It is a private, nonprofit corporation. In its most recent I.R.S. filing, reporting as of Dec. 31, 2016, it had approximately $1 million in assets. Mr. Trump served as the foundation’s president from its start until Jan. 23, 2017, three days after he was inaugurated as president. Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump also stepped down from her position on the foundation’s board of directors. His sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., are still members of the board. In October 2016, then-Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman ordered the Trump Foundation to cease soliciting donations in New York, after reporting by The Washington Post revealed a host of confirmed and potential legal violations. "
376,"WASHINGTON — Stephen K. Bannon, 10 months removed from the job of chief strategist to President Trump and five months after his ouster from the arch-conservative news site Breitbart News, is betting that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can disrupt banking the way Mr. Trump disrupted American politics. Mr. Bannon won’t reveal very much about his cryptocurrency plans — he worries that the controversy that comes with his name could have a bad impact on projects just getting off the ground. But he has had private meetings with cryptocurrency investors and hedge funds where he has discussed working on so-called initial coin offerings through his investment business, Bannon & Company. And in his first interview on the topic, he said he had a “good stake” in Bitcoin. In a small gathering of academics at Harvard University this spring, he even floated the possibility of creating a new virtual currency, the “deplorables coin.” The name is a nod to Hillary Clinton’s description of Mr. Trump’s supporters as “a basket of deplorables.” The work that Mr. Bannon is doing in the virtual currency realm is still in its early stages. But he has expressed an interest in helping entrepreneurs and even countries looking to create their own cryptocurrencies — generally outside the United States. The offbeat world of cryptocurrencies has drawn interest from all sorts over the last few years, from drug dealers and scam artists to the biggest companies in Silicon Valley and the most staid institutions of Wall Street. "
377,"SAN FRANCISCO — Earthquakes are part of the California bargain, a risk that residents accept in exchange for the state’s natural beauty, sunshine and plentiful jobs. This unspoken seismic trade-off came into sharp focus last month when, for the first time, a government earthquake study included a list of potentially vulnerable high-rise buildings in San Francisco. The list includes some of the city’s most prominent hotels and office buildings. Engineers have known about a major defect in certain steel-frame buildings since 1994, when shaking from the Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles fractured critical joints in more than 60 buildings, bringing at least one very close to collapse. The building code was rewritten to eliminate the flawed technique. Yet nearly a quarter of a century later, California is still wrestling with what to do with the hundreds of buildings, many of them high rises, that were constructed during the more than three decades when the defective connection system was widely employed. Last year Santa Monica, which has identified more than 70 steel-frame buildings believed to have the problem, became the first city in California to order mandatory retrofits. A similar law in nearby West Hollywood comes into effect in August. “This is an issue that structural engineers should have been dealing with continuously since the mid-1990s and we just dropped it,” said Keith Porter, an earthquake engineering expert who helped lead the United States Geological Survey study that published the list of San Francisco high rises. “We don’t know how to deal with a problem this big.” Experts consider these buildings vulnerable to collapse only in extreme shaking caused by rare and powerful earthquakes, similar to the one that struck San Francisco in 1906. The list, buried among the seismic calculations of an appendix in the U.S.G.S. report, includes around 40 steel-frame high rises clustered in downtown San Francisco and built between 1960 and 1994, the approximate years when the flawed technique was employed. There are more than 200 high rises in the city. "
378,"When the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin wanted to address the issue of free speech on campus last fall, it adopted a three-strikes policy that is the strictest of its kind: Any student found to have disrupted the free expression of others is expelled after a third infraction. The goal was to foster an atmosphere of “civility, respect and safety,” and avoid the kind of violent, unruly disruptions that prevented conservatives from speaking at schools like the University of California, Berkeley, and Middlebury College. Those protests had focused national attention on the question of whether college campuses were shutting out politically unpopular points of view. Wisconsin is not alone. Republican-led state legislatures in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina have imposed similar policies on public colleges and universities, and bills to establish campus speech guidelines are under consideration in at least seven other legislatures. These efforts, funded in part by big-money Republican donors, are part of a growing and well-organized campaign that has put academia squarely in the cross hairs of the American right. The spate of new policies shows how conservatives are successfully advancing one of their longstanding goals: to turn the tables in the debate over the First Amendment by casting the left as an enemy of open and free political expression on campuses. It was at schools like Berkeley, after all, that the free speech movement blossomed in the 1960s. The new efforts raise a question that has only grown more intractable since President Trump took office: When one person’s beliefs sound like hate speech to another, how do you ensure a more civil political debate? What conservatives see as a necessary corrective to decades of political imbalance in higher education, liberals and some college administrators see as an overly paternalistic approach to a problem that is being used as ammunition in the culture wars. "
379,"On a Wednesday afternoon late last month, at a ceremony on the White House South Lawn, President Trump introduced several new members of the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition. The former Yankees great Mariano Rivera, the former running back Herschel Walker and the gold-medalist beach volleyball player Misty May-Treanor were all called out. Then President Trump acknowledged another group of athletes who happened to be there that day, and were receiving an honor the Philadelphia Eagles, the Golden State Warriors and several other championship-winning teams have not in a polarized era, when a previously harmless photo-op with the leader of the free world has become a fraught activity. “And we have the Wake Forest N.C.A.A. championship tennis team here,” Mr. Trump said. The men’s squad had won the national title barely a week before, defeating Ohio State on their home complex in Winston-Salem, N.C. Yet here they were at the White House just eight days later. How’s that? “Patrick is back there,” Mr. Trump said, calling out perhaps his favorite Demon Deacon. Mr. Trump is not an N.C.A.A. tennis junkie. “Patrick” is Patrick Hannity, son of Sean Hannity, the Fox News host. He is a redshirt freshman who previously starred at Cold Spring Harbor High School on Long Island, where he was a New York state finalist in doubles. He played only in the fall this season, compiling records of 3-4 this season in singles and 3-4 in doubles, but was invaluable when it came to getting his team into the Oval Office. Sean Hannity “helped instigate the talks” that led to the White House visit, a Wake Forest spokesman confirmed. “That was the driving force,” the spokesman, Dan Wallace, added. It is not unusual for the N.C.A.A. men’s tennis champion to receive a White House visit. Recent title-winners from Southern California, U.C.L.A. and the University of Virginia all took part in presidential fetes. However, these visits occurred during days reserved for numerous N.C.A.A. champions in less-heralded sports, like one in November 2017 that featured 18 teams. "
380,"Just how reliable is suburban liberalism? In affluent, largely white Massachusetts communities like Wellesley, Southborough and Dedham, Hillary Clinton crushed Donald Trump by margins ranging from 23 to 50 percentage points. These and other townships surrounding Boston epitomize the gains the Democratic Party has made nationwide in liberal, well-educated suburbs. Ryan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard, published a book last year, “The Space Between Us,” suggesting that the ideological commitment of liberals in these and other similar communities may waver, or fail entirely, when their white homogeneity is threatened. Not only is the upscale wing of the Democratic Party an unreliable ally of the left on economic issues — as I have noted in this column before and as Lily Geismer and Matthew D. Lassiter eloquently pointed out in The Times last week — but Enos demonstrates that the liberal resolve of affluent Democrats can disintegrate when racially or ethnically charged issues like neighborhood integration are at stake. Six years ago, Enos looked at nine townships southwest of Boston that were “overwhelmingly racially and politically liberal.” As such, these communities were a “test of the power of demographic change because these were people who, we might think, would be unlikely to change their attitudes in the face of immigration.” Enos and his colleagues conducted an experiment, which is described in detail in a 2014 paper, “Causal effect of intergroup contact on exclusionary attitudes,” published by the National Academy of Sciences. The results are thought provoking. "
381,"Last-ditch diplomatic efforts could not stop the Saudi Arabian and Emirati coalition’s offensive on the Yemeni port city of Al Hudaydah this week. With no real prospect for peace talks of any kind, the city, a fief of the Houthi rebels who control much of the country and a hub for humanitarian assistance for millions of desperate Yemeni civilians, could fall within days. If the offensive goes according to the Saudis’ and Emiratis’ plan, promptly after that, the Houthis, who also control the capital Sana, will sue for peace. The maritime blockade in place since 2015 could then be lifted. After that, a vast humanitarian operation could unfold, saving Yemen from a devastating famine. But nothing in this war has gone according plan so far, and the risks of mass starvation are greater than ever, even if Al Hudaydah falls fast. And yet the United Nations Security Council has not seized on the emergency, and in my conversations with diplomats in New York on Wednesday, that passivity was laced with cynicism: If the Yemenis could survive the hardships of the past few years of war, some were saying, they would be fine for a bit longer. Just over three years ago, Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, responded to the Houthi rebels’ sudden takeover of Sana by ordering an armed intervention to support the official government, which had retreated to the coastal city of Aden. The Houthis are an Islamist revivalist movement with a strong base in northern Yemen and ties to Iran. Saudi airplanes alone have flown more than 100,000 combat missions since then. The United Arab Emirates has joined in, with fighter jets and special forces, overseeing the enforcement of a blockade along the coast. Various Yemeni militias, together with some 7,000 Sudanese paramilitaries, have staged ground attacks. But the Houthi army — about 100,000 fighters strong — has hung on, fighting tenaciously and escalating the conflict by firing ballistic missiles deep into Saudi Arabia. "
382,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “Sleep well tonight!” President Trump told Americans on Twitter after returning from his meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong-un of North Korea, adding that there was “no longer a nuclear threat” to the U.S. But the path to disarmament remains unclear. North Korea still has 141 sites devoted to the production and use of weapons of mass destruction, and its state media has not mentioned the ambitious disarmament targets that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo outlined in South Korea on Wednesday. • The talks seem to have lowered the short-term chances of war on the Korean Peninsula, but for Japan and South Korea, they’ve raised fears of a U.S. retreat from the region. • “President Trump and I are going to continue to fight for what we know is right.” That’s what Vice President Mike Pence told a gathering of nearly 10,000 evangelical pastors in Dallas on Wednesday, appealing for their continued support (but drawing some complaints that a religious event was being used for political gain). Even as evangelicals praise Mr. Trump for nominating Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and for advancing anti-abortion priorities, they are not in lock-step allegiance to his presidency. Among their concerns: the administration’s stance on immigration and race, and Mr. Pence’s allegiance to a president accused of sexual misconduct. "

384,"Good morning on this hot and windy Thursday. The school year is winding down, but a rancorous debate at our city’s elite public high schools is just heating up. A new plan to diversify the schools has emotions running high. That’s understandable: The change brings together issues of segregation, inequality, class and privilege — not to mention the future of our city’s children. But as important as this story is, it’s also complicated. Here’s a quick explanation of the proposed changes and the controversy surrounding them. What’s the new plan? This month, Mayor Bill de Blasio proposed a change to the way eight of the city’s nine specialized high schools admit students. Under the mayor’s plan, the Specialized High School Admissions Test — a one-day exam that serves as the sole criterion for admission — would be eliminated. Instead, top students would be accepted based on class rank and statewide test scores. [Here’s more about the mayor’s plan.] Why is he doing this? In an op-ed published on Chalkbeat, the mayor said these schools have a diversity problem, calling it a “monumental injustice.” Black and Hispanic students make up 67 percent of the city’s public school population, but only 10 percent of the incoming students at the elite schools. Asian-American students make up 16 percent of the school system and 62 percent at the elite schools; white students make up 15 percent of the overall population and 24 percent at the elite schools. There are more than 600 middle schools in the city, but just 21 of those schools supply half the students at the elite high schools, the mayor said. [Here’s an explainer on why our schools are segregated.] So what’s the problem with the plan? Some say the plan to add more diversity would actually discriminate against a minority group: Asian-Americans. By adding more black and Hispanic students to the schools, the number of Asian-American students would necessarily decrease. Kenneth Chiu, president of the New York City Asian-American Democratic Club, called the plan discriminatory. And Peter Koo, a city councilman, said the test, as it exists now, is “the most unbiased way to get into a school.” "
385,"BEIJING — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Asian powers on Thursday that President Trump was sticking to demands that North Korea surrender its nuclear weapons, as he sought to hold together a fragile consensus on maintaining tough sanctions against the North despite Mr. Trump’s declaration that it was “no longer a nuclear threat.” At a news conference in Seoul, South Korea, Mr. Pompeo softened some of the president’s recent comments — but did not retract them — and insisted that United Nations sanctions would remain in place until North Korea had accomplished “complete denuclearization.” “We are going to get the complete denuclearization,” Mr. Pompeo told reporters. “Only then will there be relief from sanctions.” He made the same point later Thursday in Beijing, where he met with China’s president, Xi Jinping. But China had already shown signs of breaking ranks on tough enforcement of the sanctions against its neighbor and trading partner, saying that with North Korea now at the negotiating table, they could legitimately be eased. China did not appear to have budged from that position on Thursday. At a news conference alongside China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, Mr. Pompeo conceded that the United Nations sanctions had “mechanisms for relief” and said that “we have agreed at the appropriate time they will be considered.” But he insisted that time would be after “full denuclearization.” Mr. Wang, who said China was intent on playing “a constructive role” in connection with the North, declined to answer a question about China’s intentions on the sanctions. "
386,"Conservative religious leaders who have long preached about the sanctity of the family are now issuing sharp rebukes of the Trump administration for immigration policies that tear families apart or leave them in danger. The criticism came after recent moves by the administration to separate children from their parents at the border, and to deny asylum on a routine basis to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence. Some of the religious leaders are the same evangelicals and Roman Catholics who helped President Trump to build his base and who have otherwise applauded his moves to limit abortion and champion the rights of religious believers. The Rev. Franklin Graham, a son of the famed evangelist the Rev. Billy Graham and an outspoken defender of President Trump, said in an interview on Tuesday on the Christian Broadcasting Network, “I think it’s disgraceful, it’s terrible to see families ripped apart and I don’t support that one bit.” He quickly made it clear that this had not dimmed his enthusiasm for Mr. Trump, adding, “I blame the politicians for the last 20, 30 years that have allowed this to escalate to where it is today.” "
387,"BROWNSVILLE, Tex. — In the loading docks, children sat in a darkened auditorium watching the animated movie “Moana.” Where there were once racks of clothes and aisles of appliances, there were now spotless dorm-style bedrooms with neatly made beds and Pokemon posters on the walls. The back parking lots were now makeshift soccer fields and volleyball courts. The McDonald’s was now the cafeteria. All this made it difficult to visualize what the sprawling facility used to be — a former Walmart Supercenter. The converted retail store at the southern tip of Texas has become the largest licensed migrant children’s shelter in the country — a warehouse for nearly 1,500 boys aged 10 to 17 who were caught illegally crossing the border. The teeming, 250,000-square-foot facility is a model of border life in Trump-era America, part of a growing industry of detention centers and shelters as federal authorities scramble to comply with the president’s order to end “catch and release” of migrants illegally entering the country. Now that children are often being separated from their parents, this facility has had to obtain a waiver from the state to expand its capacity. Cots are being added to sleeping areas. The staff is expanding. But even that is not enough. Federal authorities are considering establishing tent cities on Army and Air Force bases, and have already transferred hundreds of immigrant detainees to temporary housing at federal prisons. On Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that temporary tent housing would be set up near the border station in Tornillo, Tex., to house up to 360 youths. That prompted an angry response from a Democratic state senator, José Rodríguez, who noted that temperatures could be expected to exceed 100 degrees at the site. “This is what totalitarians in the Middle East and elsewhere do,” he said in a statement. "
388,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The election of London Breed as mayor of San Francisco, which was all but made official Wednesday when Mark Leno, the runner-up in the election, conceded defeat, was a remarkable victory. Ms. Breed is the first African-American woman to hold the post in San Francisco. And San Francisco is now the largest American city with a female mayor. For many black people in the city, Ms. Breed’s election has a special resonance, one that rekindles the hope that the long and steady decline of San Francisco’s African-American population might be stanched or even reversed. “We were fast becoming an invisible people in this city,” said the Rev. Amos Brown, the pastor of Third Baptist Church, where Ms. Breed is a congregant. “Maybe we can now stop this hemorrhaging.” John William Templeton, a historian of black culture and business in San Francisco, said he hoped Ms. Breed could serve as a beacon and a magnet for black entrepreneurs across the country. “The campaign got a lot of people around the country interested in San Francisco who wouldn’t have thought about it before,” he said.

389,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. It’s like a jail for children. In Brownsville, Tex., the federal government has incarcerated more than 1,400 boys between the ages of 10 and 17. They are being held in a former Walmart, as part of the Trump administration’s new policy of separating parents and children who illegally try to enter the United States. The boys each have less than 40 square feet of living space. They spend 22 hours a day inside the former Walmart and receive two hours outside. Lights out is at 9 P.M. “I have been inside a federal prison and county jails,” MSNBC’s Jacob Soboroff said yesterday on Twitter, after visiting the shelter, which is called Casa Padre. “This place is called a shelter but these kids are incarcerated.” The facility predates the Trump administration, as a place to hold migrant children who attempt to enter this country by themselves. But the number of boys there is now growing because of the new child-separation policy. “The policy of criminally prosecuting all who cross the border illegally is creating a new category of residents at these holding centers, young boys and girls who are grappling with the trauma of being unexpectedly separated from their mothers and fathers,” write Michael E. Miller, Emma Brown and Aaron C. Davis in The Washington Post. I urge you to read a series of tweets by Soboroff or the Post story. Your government has separated these children from their families and is detaining them in warehouselike conditions. “You might want to smile,” Alexia Rodriguez, one of the executives who runs Casa Padre, told journalists who toured it yesterday (after Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon called attention to the facility by getting turned away at the door). “The kids feel a little like animals in a cage, being looked at,” Rodriguez said. Oh, and one last detail: Casa Padre is full of murals of American presidents. The mural that greets visitors near the front depicts a smirking President Trump, an American flag and the White House and reads, “Sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.” "
390,"Donald Trump is well known for liking people he thinks are tough. Not war heroes like Senator John McCain, or Gold Star parents like Khizr and Ghazala Khan, but authoritarians like Vladimir Putin of Russia, whom he’s hailed as a “strong leader,” or China’s president for life, Xi Jinping, “a good man” for whom the president has “great respect.” Now the president has discovered a new figure of admiration. In an interview that aired on Fox Wednesday evening, Bret Baier asked Mr. Trump about Kim Jong-un: “You sometimes call people killers. He is a killer. He’s clearly executing people,” said the Fox News anchor, all but spelling out the right answer for Mr. Trump. Here’s how the president responded: “He’s a tough guy. Hey, when you take over a country, a tough country with tough people, and you take it over from your father I don’t care who you are, what you are, how much of an advantage you have. If you could do that at 27 years old, I mean, that’s 1 in 10,000 that could do that.” Let’s talk, Mr. President, about toughness. Tough is Yeonmi Park. As a young child, Ms. Park believed that Kim Jong-il, Mr. Kim’s father, was so powerful that he could read her mind. At 9 years old she witnessed the public execution of her friend’s mother. The state had decided that death was the proper punishment for the crime of watching a Hollywood movie. Like so many of her fellow citizens, Ms. Park resorted to eating insects to survive in a place she has called “a living hell.” "
391,"The New York State attorney general’s office filed a scathingly worded lawsuit on Thursday taking aim at the Donald J. Trump Foundation, accusing the charity and the Trump family of sweeping violations of campaign finance laws, self-dealing and illegal coordination with the presidential campaign. The lawsuit, which seeks to dissolve the foundation and bar President Trump and three of his children from serving on nonprofit organizations, was an extraordinary rebuke of a sitting president. The attorney general also sent referral letters to the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission for possible further action, adding to Mr. Trump’s extensive legal challenges. The lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, culminated a nearly two-year investigation of Mr. Trump’s charity, which became a subject of scrutiny during and after the 2016 presidential campaign. While such foundations are supposed to be devoted to charitable activities, the petition asserts that Mr. Trump’s was often improperly used to settle legal claims against his various businesses, even spending $10,000 on a portrait of Mr. Trump that was hung at one of his golf clubs. The foundation was also used to curry political favor, the lawsuit asserts. During the 2016 race, the foundation became a virtual arm of Mr. Trump’s campaign, email traffic showed, with his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, directing its expenditures, even though such foundations are explicitly prohibited from political activities. The attorney general’s office is seeking the Trump Foundation to pay $2.8 million in restitution, the amount raised for the foundation at a 2016 Iowa political fund-raiser. At the time, Mr. Trump skipped a Republican debate and set up his own event to raise money for veterans, though he used the event to skewer his opponents and celebrate his own accomplishments. Mr. Trump immediately attacked the lawsuit, characterizing it in a Twitter post as an attempt by the “sleazy New York Democrats” to damage him by suing the foundation, and vowing not to settle the case — much as he did when the same office filed a lawsuit accusing Trump University. (Mr. Trump in 2016 paid a $25 million settlement to resolve the inquiry.) "
392,"PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia — Racing to figure out the depth of the fiscal crisis that awaited him after his inauguration, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his aides first entered the Malaysian government offices last month to find an alarming sight: oversize garbage bags filled with shredded documents, a snowstorm of loose papers on the floor, even half-consumed food left by former occupants in a hurry to get out. At the Finance Ministry down the street, Lim Guan Eng, Malaysia’s new finance minister, found computers in which even the highest-ranking bureaucrats were locked out of certain accounts. In some cases, vital files were accessible only to a single person: Najib Razak, the nation’s scandal-tainted former prime minister, who had also served as finance minister. Evidence of financial malfeasance by Mr. Najib and his cronies helped Mr. Mahathir’s opposition alliance win national elections on May 9, unseating a political force that had governed Malaysia since it gained independence in 1957. But the euphoria surrounding a historic democratic transition has given way to a more sobering reality. Even without piecing together a single shredded document, Mr. Mahathir, who previously served as prime minister from 1981 to 2003, has discovered that the country is in far worse financial shape than he and his allies had feared. The national debt, tallied at $170 billion by Mr. Najib’s administration, has been reassessed, along with other government liabilities, at $250 billion. That is 80 percent of Malaysia’s gross domestic product. “The more we look into the previous administration, the more bad things we find,” Mr. Mahathir said in an interview in the grand, Islamic-style prime minister’s office in Putrajaya, the administrative capital he helped design in the late 1990s. “Any organization that had money, the previous government found the means to take the money.” The United States Department of Justice has already accused Mr. Najib, Mr. Mahathir’s one-time protégé, of siphoning $731 million from the country’s investment fund into his personal bank accounts. At least $4.5 billion is believed to have been diverted from that fund, known as 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. "
393,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Gambles and Loses on AT&T” (editorial, June 14): How disappointing to find The Times celebrating the fact that Judge Richard Leon has allowed AT&T to purchase Time Warner, producing a communications juggernaut that will have tremendous power in the lives of Americans. We can expect more expensive options for home entertainment, mobile phone services, and other communications and TV-related aspects of our lives. We can expect more political power for a behemoth that controls large portions of the American airwaves and has huge revenues to contribute to political ends. And we can expect this vertical monopoly to affect us in other ways that we can’t even envision. You say we should celebrate this decision because President Trump opposed the merger out of a desire to spite CNN. But are you celebrating out of a desire to spite Mr. Trump? In 2017, several liberal senators — including Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Al Franken — urged the Justice Department to oppose the merger. It spites them, too. And it spites Americans. Far from celebrating this decision, I feel saddened. For me, having the last laugh would have meant seeing this administration do the right thing for Americans for once — even for the wrong reason. ANNE MACKIN, BOSTON To the Editor: Re “Merger Decision Is a Green Light for Deal-Making” (front page, June 13): The day after net neutrality ends, giving AT&T the legal right to deny competitors access to its telecoms customers, a federal court approves the AT&T-Time Warner merger on the grounds that Hulu, Amazon, Netflix and others provide ample competition for delivery of content. This makes no sense upon even cursory analysis. How are Netflix et al. going to sell me anything over my AT&T-provided internet service if AT&T decides not to permit them to do so (or to charge them a large premium to do so)? In prior vertical mergers, the merging companies did not have control of a bottleneck essential to reaching customers. Internet service in the United States today is at best an oligopoly. Allowing those oligopolists to control the content consumers want while simultaneously allowing them to deny access to competing content is a recipe for higher prices and stagnated innovation. Our nation now seems to exist for the benefit of large corporations, not human beings. JAMES BOLIN, CHARLOTTE, N.C. "
394,"Debut novelists often have a hard time attracting attention, so publishers and critics look for the little things that set them apart. Are they casting new light on the old neglected story of Native American identity and displacement? Tommy Orange is, with his novel about characters gathering for a tribal powwow in urban Oakland, Calif. Are they bridging the gap between East and West, and testing the nuances of immigration and exile? Negar Djavadi is, with her story of a family of Iranian emigrants to Paris. Are they a former POTUS collaborating with James Patterson on a political thriller about a rogue president who goes missing in the name of national security? O.K., Bill Clinton might not need the help. But here he is anyway, on this week’s list of recommended titles alongside worthwhile new books from Michael Ondaatje (a novel of war and secrets), Michael Pollan (a deep dive into the world of psychedelic drugs), Catherine Nixey (an exploration of cultural destruction among early Christians) and more.

Senior Editor, Books THERE THERE, by Tommy Orange. (Knopf, $25.95.) This debut novel by Orange, an enrolled member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes of Oklahoma, follows 12 Native American characters, many of them related, as their lives move toward an event called the Big Oakland Powwow. Our critic Dwight Garner praises the book’s “jangling energy” and the way it “brings so much news from a distinct corner of American life.” Orange is “especially interested in what cultural inheritance means, in how to carry your roots like a conscience, in what one needs to leave behind and what one needs to take.” THE COLLECTED STORIES OF MACHADO DE ASSIS, by Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis. Translated by Margaret Jull Costa and Robin Patterson. (Liveright, $35.) Machado was a gentle romantic who blossomed into a wicked ironist. His authorial intrusions, jump cuts and sheer mischief influenced American experimentalists like John Barth and Donald Barthelme. His short stories “pulse with life,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. “Few fiction writers have written so affectionately about ideas, as if they were real people.” To Machado, Sehgal writes, “your identity and the contours of your world are formed not just by your circumstances but by what you think about habitually. You are what you contemplate, so choose wisely. These stories are a spectacular place to start.” THE PRESIDENT IS MISSING, by Bill Clinton and James Patterson. (Little, Brown and Knopf, $30.) In this thriller and escapist fairy tale co-written by Clinton and Patterson, the fictitious President Jonathan Lincoln Duncan is in trouble for supposedly having had dealings with terrorists. What the press and public don’t know is that Duncan was trying to avert a crisis, not start one. A looming cyberthreat is so horrible that the feared virus is called Dark Ages. The novel piles on loads of scary details about what the world would be like if your computer became nothing but a doorstop. “This book’s a big one,” our reviewer Janet Maslin writes. “It’s driven by star power and persuasive-sounding presidential candor.” HOW TO CHANGE YOUR MIND: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence, by Michael Pollan. (Penguin Press, $28.) Best known as a food writer, Pollan here summarizes recent research into psychedelics and how they can reduce trauma. He also describes, in sometimes remarkable ways, how he experienced his own trips. “As is to be expected of a nonfiction writer of his caliber, Pollan makes the story of the rise and fall and rise of psychedelic drug research gripping and surprising,” Tom Bissell writes in his review. “Where Pollan truly shines is in his exploration of the mysticism and spirituality of psychedelic experiences.” "
395,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department’s inspector general on Thursday painted a harsh portrait of the F.B.I. during the 2016 presidential election, describing a destructive culture in which James B. Comey, the former director, was “insubordinate,” senior officials privately bashed Donald J. Trump and agents came to distrust prosecutors. The 500-page report criticized Mr. Comey for breaking with longstanding policy and publicly discussing — in a news conference and a pair of letters in the middle of the campaign — an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server in handling classified information. The report was a firm rebuke of those actions, which Mr. Comey has tried for months to defend. Nevertheless, the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, did not challenge the conclusion that Mrs. Clinton should not be prosecuted. That investigation loomed over most of the presidential campaign, and Mr. Horowitz and his investigators uncovered no proof that political opinions at the F.B.I. influenced its outcome. “We found no evidence that the conclusions by department prosecutors were affected by bias or other improper considerations,” he wrote. “Rather, we concluded that they were based on the prosecutor’s assessment of facts, the law and past department practice.” But the report — initiated in response to a chorus of requests from Congress and the public — was far from an exoneration. Mr. Horowitz was unsparing in his criticism of Mr. Comey and referred five F.B.I. employees for possible discipline over pro-Clinton or anti-Trump commentary in electronic messages. He said agents were far too cozy with journalists. And he described a breakdown in the chain of command, calling it “extraordinary” that the attorney general acceded to Mr. Comey during the most controversial moments of the Clinton investigation. The result, Mr. Horowitz said, undermined public confidence in the F.B.I. and sowed doubt about the bureau’s handling of the Clinton investigation, which even two years later remains politically divisive. Mrs. Clinton’s supporters blame Mr. Comey for her election loss. Mr. Trump believes that Mr. Comey and his agents conspired to clear Mrs. Clinton of wrongdoing because they were openly hostile to his candidacy. "
396,"WASHINGTON — Two senators have asked President Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers to turn over an analysis that shows the administration’s tariffs would slow economic growth. The internal analysis, which was first reported by The New York Times last week, contradicts the public statements of several Trump administration officials who have said that Mr. Trump’s plan to impose tariffs on aluminum, steel and a broad array of Chinese products will not dampen economic growth. The existence of such a study has raised questions about whether the Trump administration is pursuing policies that its own experts know is at odds with economic reality. Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, and Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, sent a letter to Kevin Hassett, chairman of the council, asking him to hand over any research on tariffs by June 27. The two senators, who sent the letter on Wednesday, lead the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. “To better understand the potential consequences of the administration’s trade policies, we respectfully request that you produce the C.E.A. economic analysis relating to the administration’s steel and aluminum tariffs and all supporting data and documents,” they wrote. The council does not publicly release all of its research and it is not clear how much damage it estimates the tariffs and potential retaliation from other countries would do to the administration’s economic growth projections. Mr. Trump has made achieving sustainable 3 percent economic growth a centerpiece of his agenda. Mr. Hassett has dodged the question when asked about it in public settings, suggesting that the threat of tariffs will encourage other countries to lower their trade barriers and therefore boost global economic growth. “If you model a future where everybody else reduces their trade barriers to ours, then that’s massively good for the global economy and massively good for the U.S. economy,” Mr. Hassett said last week. Gary D. Cohn, the former director of Mr. Trump’s National Economic Council, said at an event hosted by The Washington Post on Thursday that he was already seeing signs that companies were holding back on investment out of fears of a trade war. He said that tit-for-tat tariffs could negate the economic benefits of Mr. Trump’s tax cuts. “If you end up with a tariff battle, you will end up with price inflation, you could end up with more consumer debt, those are all historic ingredients for an economic slowdown,” Mr. Cohn said. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H. Powell acknowledged anecdotal concern about business investment slowing as a result of the tariffs but said, so far, the Fed had no data to support that. “We really don’t see it in the numbers,” he said. “I would put it down as more of a risk.” A C.E.A. spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the Senate request. "
397,"Polls suggest that the public considers health care the most important issue in the midterm elections. This immediately raises the question: Do voters understand what’s at stake? In particular, do they realize that if Republicans hold Congress, they will strip away protections for the 52 million Americans — more than a quarter of nonelderly adults — who have pre-existing conditions that, before passage of the Affordable Care Act, could have led insurers to deny them coverage? In fact, the Trump administration is already trying to take away those protections via the courts. It probably won’t succeed. But it might, in which case an estimated 17 million Americans would lose their health coverage. And even if the lawsuit fails, the administration’s support for an incredibly flimsy legal challenge — one so indefensible that three career Justice Department lawyers withdrew from the case — is a clear signal of Republican priorities: G.O.P. to Americans with health problems: Drop dead. By the way, some people seem surprised by the administration’s moves here, since Donald Trump has promised many times to protect people with pre-existing conditions. But remember: The campaign against the Affordable Care Act has been based on lies every step of the way. First there were lies about what was actually in the act. Remember “death panels”? Then there were lies about the law’s effects. For a while, the Koch brothers-financed group Americans for Prosperity was running ads featuring supposedly real stories of Americans facing terrible hardships because of the A.C.A. But none — none — of these stories stood up to fact-checking. So the ads became vaguer and vaguer, and eventually featured actors pretending to be A.C.A. victims rather than featuring real victims, who were apparently too hard to find. But the most enduring lie from A.C.A. opponents — not just Trump, but all of them — is their claim that they want to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. They don’t, and they never did. "
398,"On Wednesday, I had an online conversation with Ralph Reed, the head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. During the 2016 election, Mr. Reed was instrumental in getting out the evangelical vote for Donald Trump. His group, which has some 1.8 million members, says it will spend $20 million to turn out evangelical voters in the November midterm elections. I interviewed Mr. Reed late last month at the Times Center and touched briefly on the question of how he squares his Christian values with support for the Trump administration: I wanted to ask him more about that tension, about the Trump administration’s policy of separating families at the border, the president’s executive order — the news about it broke in the middle of our conversation — and more. An edited version of our discussion follows. WEISS: Ralph, it seems to me that the only topic anyone wants to talk about right now is the White House’s family separation policy, which is currently being enforced on our southern border. (By the time we finish this conversation, the president may sign an executive order ending that policy, though the details are still unclear. I’m refreshing our home page as we speak.) On Tuesday, your organization, the Faith and Freedom Coalition, made headlines for a letter you put out about that policy. You wrote: “The separation of families illegally crossing the border is heartbreaking and tragic, part of the larger tragedy of a broken immigration system that does not reflect our values or our faith.” What do you think ought to happen at the border? If you were talking to Mr. Trump — which you do — how would you advise him? REED: My advice to President Trump and Congress is identical to what’s in that letter we sent to Capitol Hill: Act now to fix a broken immigration system that does not reflect our values as a nation or our conscience as people of faith. We want the separation of families to end. We also agree with President Trump that doing so requires congressional action. "
399,"The posters for “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” promise that “The Park Is Gone.” Perhaps that’s meant to be foreboding, but it mostly sounds like an end to fun. The “Fallen Kingdom” part is also frankly a little obscure. The mistake, however, might be to suppose that these words mean anything at all. Sense is a thing this movie doesn’t have much interest in making. Which is far from the worst that can be said about it. When the first “Jurassic Park” movie (based on a novel by Michael Crichton) opened in 1993, it was both a parable and an example of extravagant human ambition. One well-intentioned, misguided visionary (Richard Attenborough) used genetic engineering to revive of long-extinct species. Another (Steven Spielberg) used special effects to the same end. The results were a little ridiculous, but also scary, thrilling and intermittently thought-provoking. That was hubris. This is business. The reawakening of the slumbering franchise in 2015 gave birth to “Jurassic World,” one of the highest-grossing terrible movies of all time, a lumbering walk in the rebooted park that squandered the charisma of the big lizards and the charm of the human cast in a witless farrago of blockbuster self-importance. “Fallen Kingdom,” directed by J. A. Bayona, is in most respects a dumber, less ambitious movie than its immediate predecessor, and also, for just that reason, a little bit more fun. Some of its high jinks have a hokey, silly, old-fashioned mad-scientist feeling to them, especially when the dinosaurs are chasing people or vice versa. Which is reasonably often. Mr. Bayona and the screenwriters, Colin Trevorrow (who directed “Jurassic World”) and Derek Connolly (who was a co-writer of it), try to atone for the sexism that was one of the most remarked-upon features of the last installment. This time, Bryce Dallas Howard is outfitted with practical footwear. There is a “nasty woman” joke and a visual gag at the expense of President Trump’s hair. None of this should be mistaken for topicality. The semi-interesting ethical questions that have hovered around Jurassic Park since the beginning — what are the limits of human tampering with nature? What obligations do we owe to imaginary creatures? — have been stretched to almost invisible thinness. The park is gone! It’s time to go into the house. Because the filmmakers decided that the best thing to do with the rampaging digital dinosaurs was to bring them indoors. The tropical island off the coast of whatever is emptied out so that the giant proto-birds could be moved to a mansion in Northern California. Supposedly the creatures are there to be protected from a cruel re-extinction policy, but actually they are pawns in a diabolical scheme to breed super-weapons that can be auctioned off to a gathering of international bad guys. "
400,"WASHINGTON — President Trump plans to propose a reorganization of the federal government as early as Thursday that includes a possible merger of the Education and Labor Departments, coupled with a reshuffling of other domestic agencies to make them easier to cut or revamp, according to administration officials briefed on the proposal. The plan, which will most likely face significant opposition in Congress from Democrats and some Republicans, includes relocating many social safety net programs into a new megadepartment, which would replace the Department of Health and Human Services and possibly include the word “welfare” in its title. Mr. Trump and his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, the architect of the plan, have sought to redefine as welfare subsistence benefit programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and housing aid. It is part of a rebranding effort, championed by conservative think tanks and House Republicans, to link them to unpopular direct-cash assistance programs that have traditionally been called welfare. “They have been using the word welfare because it is pejorative,” said Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow in the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan Washington think tank. “The programs you can call welfare are actually very small in comparison to SNAP, which is an income support necessary to help families, workers and millions of kids.” At the heart of the plan is expected to be an attempt to shift SNAP, which serves more than 42 million poor and working-class Americans, to the new agency from the Agriculture Department. Conservative think tanks, including the Heritage Foundation and Koch-related entities, have long sought to de-link food aid from agriculture in hopes of cutting costs. Senate Republicans, who have already rejected a more modest Trump administration attempt to increase work requirements for SNAP recipients, are unlikely to sign off on the shift, which was first reported by Politico.

401,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Retreating After Border Policy Outcry” (nytimes.com, June 20): Well done, resistance. The protesters, the media that told the stories of the children, the politicians, medical professionals and celebrities who spoke out, the many who donated money to organizations that support immigrant families, and the Americans who took to social media let President Trump know what we want America to look like. And he backed down. The people spoke, and the people were heard. HENRIETTA ATKIN, OAK PARK, ILL. To the Editor: My wife’s family is Honduran. Several of her family members have been murdered. One was a cousin who witnessed people breaking into a store and was killed on the spot, along with the store owner. Another cousin was gunned down over a personal dispute, along with his teenage son, who was shot in the head just because he happened to be standing next to his father. What exactly is the “crime” that parents leaving conditions like these are committing when seeking asylum here in a desperate attempt to save their children’s lives? Why are so many Americans branding such people as criminals and leeches? ART SALUK, PEMBROKE PINES, FLA. To the Editor: I am puzzled by the press’s frequent failure to distinguish between asylum seekers and illegal entrants into the United States. While I do not advocate the inhumane treatment of any migrants, whatever their circumstances, it is troubling that The New York Times has not been more vigilant in calling attention to the president’s and the attorney general’s consistent attempts to confuse the issue by referring to all who cross the border as lawbreakers who deserve whatever harsh treatment they receive. DEBORAH LYONS, OXFORD, OHIO To the Editor: As a retired member of the Diplomatic Security Service with 13 years of service abroad, I am sickened by the politicization of refugees seeking shelter in the United States. The crux of the problem rests with life in the many poor and violent countries of Central America. The American public needs to know that these people are fleeing corrupt societies where they cannot provide for their families. We in the United States need to be willing to go into these countries and inject relief, using the United States Agency for International Development and other federal social programs. American funds would be better spent helping these people in their own countries rather than having them flee their homeland and illegally enter the United States. Then, we may not need to spend billions on border security. Most of us are immigrants or their descendants. But times have changed and we, as a country, cannot open our borders to everyone. There is a legal immigration process and we need to implement it with a balanced national and moral process. BRIAN FLANAGAN, ST. JAMES, N.C. "
402,"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week: Why some conservatives are pushing President Trump to support an Obama-era policy to tackle climate change. Also, another thing you can do to save energy at home. And the E.P.A. met a deadline this week to come up with a plan for regulating chemicals that have contaminated drinking water. The plan? Don’t regulate. This is not something you see every day: Over the past month, a growing chorus of Senate Republicans, conservative taxpayer groups and corporate executives has been urging President Trump to implement a major Obama-era policy to tackle climate change. They’re just not calling it that. The issue at hand revolves around air-conditioners. In 2017, at a United Nations summit in Kigali, Rwanda, President Barack Obama’s administration agreed with 196 other countries to phase out the use of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, an extremely potent greenhouse gas used in air-conditioners, refrigerators and foams. The pact was an amendment to the 1987 Montreal Protocol meant to protect the ozone layer. Experts say the policy could have a surprisingly large climate impact. With countries like China and India installing millions of new air-conditioners, HFC emissions were expected to skyrocket this century. Reducing the use of these chemicals could help avoid up to 0.44 degrees Celsius of warming by century’s end. Given that the world’s nations are trying to limit total warming below two degrees, that’s a significant chunk. "
403,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “We’ve got to be keeping families together.” In an abrupt reversal, President Trump signed an executive order to end the separation of families at the U.S. border — by indefinitely detaining parents and children together. But it’s unclear whether the courts will allow that, and the president is likely to face an immediate legal challenge from immigration activists. The order came amid a full-blown political crisis over the separations, and many kinds of protests. The policy’s most vocal defender, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, was confronted at a Mexican restaurant by chanting critics. This video traces the roots of the administration’s “zero-tolerance” policy at the border. ____ 2. The crackdown is sowing turmoil and confusion on the long migrant trail through Central America and Mexico. "
404,"The American economy has picked up speed and is now on course to expand this year at the fastest rate in more than a decade. That acceleration gives President Trump a stronger hand as he contemplates more tariffs and takes an increasingly confrontational approach with China, Canada, Mexico and other trading partners. Economists have raised their growth estimates for the second quarter to an annualized rate of nearly 5 percent, more than double the pace of the previous period. Some economists say the figure could hit 3 percent for the full year, a level last reached in 2005. As growth slows in Europe, China, Japan and elsewhere, the United States finds itself at the top of the global economy. The United States is also less exposed to the fallout from an escalating trade war since it does not rely on exports as much as other countries. It all gives Mr. Trump leverage with world leaders, potentially forcing them to make concessions. But his threats could also backfire. Economists warn that the president’s clout is limited and that his attacks on the trading system could dampen the outlook not just in other countries but also domestically. “If you have the strongest economy in years, then the trade shock appears manageable,” said Gregory Daco, head of United States economics at Oxford Economics. “However, with growth peaking, the trade shock will become more intense. With a global backdrop that is not improving anymore, we have to be careful about the back half of 2018 and 2019.” In July, the recovery will reach the nine-year mark, making it one of the longest in modern history. But for much of that time, the engines of the economy were rarely synchronized. When consumers were spending at a healthy clip in 2015 and 2016, business investment lagged as energy companies scaled back or abandoned projects in response to a sharp drop in oil prices. "
405,"WASHINGTON — President Trump urged Republican lawmakers on Wednesday not to scuttle his administration’s efforts to help the Chinese telecom firm ZTE, warning them that his reprieve for the company was part of a broader geopolitical negotiating strategy. Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers met at the White House to discuss the fate of the company, which had been banned by the Commerce Department from buying American products this year as punishment for violating American sanctions. The administration has since lifted that ban at Mr. Trump’s request and over the objections of lawmakers, who voted Monday to reinstate the penalties on ZTE. Mr. Trump ordered his Commerce Department to water down the penalties, which would have put ZTE out of business, after President Xi Jinping of China personally lobbied him to reconsider. The deal helped defuse tensions with Mr. Xi, whom the president has relied on to help pave the way for discussions with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. China and the United States are also locked in a contentious dispute over trade, with both countries threatening tariffs on billions of dollars of each other’s goods. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, suggested on Wednesday that lawmakers would be willing to compromise with the president to avoid undercutting his leverage in talks with China and North Korea. The ZTE penalty was tucked into a large military policy bill that passed this week in the Senate and still must be reconciled with the House bill, which did not include the penalty. That gives lawmakers and the White House a chance to either jettison the penalty or make it more palatable to Beijing. “I’m pretty optimistic we’ll be able to come up with something that preserves the president’s leverage,” Mr. Cornyn said after the meeting. “Because he’s telling us ‘Look, when I’m negotiating with Xi, this is more than just trade, this is more than just sanctions. This is about North Korea and other geopolitical issues.’” He added: “So we wanted to make sure we weren’t stepping on his need to have credibility and to be able to use his authority to negotiate well in these other spaces.” "
406,"WASHINGTON — Washington moves slowly except in times of crisis — political crisis that is. Beleaguered Republican members of Congress breathed a momentary sigh of relief on Wednesday after President Trump suddenly relented and took steps to stop the separation of immigrant children from their parents after they illegally entered the country along the southern border. With the midterm elections less than six months away, Republicans trying to hold their majorities in the House and Senate were desperate for quick action that would bring an end to heartbreaking images of crying toddlers who had been taken from stunned parents. They were well aware that the situation was inciting public outrage at a level that threatened to oust some Republican lawmakers from their congressional seats come November. “America is better than this inhumane, anti-family zero-tolerance policy,” the office of Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the senior Republican in the Senate, declared again in a tweet on Wednesday morning, hours before the president announced his retreat. But Republicans are not out of the woods yet. The president’s grudging executive order, which took a shot at Congress for its “failure to act,” is likely to be only a temporary respite in the standoff over immigration. Congress is still struggling to resolve myriad issues, including the fate of undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children, as well as Mr. Trump’s demand for $25 billion to build a wall along the southwestern border, with the House facing a series of difficult votes Thursday on the immigration question. At the same time, Democrats are unlikely to let the subject go. They always intended to press immigration as a major topic in many 2018 contests, and the public’s furor at the separation of families only validated that approach. It was unclear what effect the president’s decision would have on those legislative efforts. Some lawmakers said measures were still needed to make permanent the president’s executive order and to clarify how families should be treated. But others suggested that the order would relieve the pressure on the House and Senate to move ahead. "
407,"President Trump finally caved to public pressure and promised to stop separating children from parents at the border. After long insisting that he couldn’t do anything about this, he snapped his fingers and changed the policy that he had denied was a policy. Yet the next steps remain unclear and of uncertain legality. Will there be internment camps? This hazy juncture is a useful opportunity to draw lessons. Trump is right that he didn’t begin the practice of wrenching crying children from their parents. This fits into a long and shameful history: “My brothers and sisters were bid off first, and one by one, while my mother, paralyzed by grief, held me by the hand. Her turn came, and she was bought by Isaac Riley of Montgomery County. Then I was offered to the assembled purchasers. My mother, half distracted with the thought of parting forever from all her children, pushed through the crowd while the bidding for me was going on, to the spot where Riley was standing. “She fell at his feet and clung to his knees, entreating him in tones that a mother only could command to buy her baby as well as herself. … I must have been then between 5 and 6 years old. I seem to see and hear my poor weeping mother now.” — Josiah Henson, a slave in Maryland, in his account of his life from 1858 “The Negroes at home are quite disconsolate but this will soon blow over. They may see their children again in time.” — Thomas Chaplin, a slave owner, in 1845, quoted in “Help Me to Find My People,” by Heather Andrea Williams "
408,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration rebuked human rights watchdog organizations on Wednesday, blaming them in part for its decision this week to withdraw from the United Nations Human Rights Council. In a scathing letter, Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, criticized the organizations for opposing her failed push last month for a General Assembly vote on changes to the council, the world’s most important human rights body. “You put yourself on the side of Russia and China, and opposite the United States, on a key human rights issue,” she wrote to 18 organizations that criticized her attempt. “You should know that your efforts to block negotiations and thwart reform were a contributing factor in the U.S. decision to withdraw from the council.” The United States withdrew from the council on Tuesday to protest its frequent criticism of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians. The United States now joins Iran, North Korea and Eritrea as the only countries that refuse to participate in the council’s meetings and deliberations. It was the first time a member has voluntarily left the council. Several recipients of Ms. Haley’s broadside said that her proposed changes could have led to amendments from Russia, China and other nations to weaken the council. Human Rights Watch was among the nongovernmental organizations that opposed Ms. Haley’s push for a General Assembly vote. “The risk was that it would have opened a Pandora’s box of even worse problems,” Louis Charbonneau, the group’s United Nations director, said in an interview. “The idea that human rights groups were trying to undermine genuine attempts to reform the council, or that we were working with countries like Russia, is outrageous and ridiculous,” Mr. Charbonneau said. Western governments largely agreed with the watchdog groups’ view on the issue, derailing the American overhaul effort. “To this date, we have received not one written edit from a single member state,” Ms. Haley wrote in the letter on Wednesday. State Department officials said Ms. Haley’s rebuke grew out of intense frustration that the groups banded together to oppose her efforts without talking to her first. She was also frustrated that a year of work and consultations had so far yielded few results, they said. In a speech on Tuesday, Ms. Haley said she would continue to work to overhaul the council. But without the United States, changes are far harder to achieve, according to the rights organizations that said the Trump administration has a poor track record for such negotiations. "

410,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday sought to quell the uproar over his administration’s systematic separation of immigrant children from their families at the border, signing an executive order he portrayed as ending the problem. Previously, many families caught sneaking across the border — especially those seeking asylum — were released into the United States while their immigration cases were processed. But in April, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that federal prosecutors would now pursue a zero-tolerance policy of criminally prosecuting every adult who illegally crossed the border or tried to do so. Sending adults to jail for prosecution prompted a set of court-imposed rules stemming from a class-action lawsuit over how the government handled unaccompanied minors in immigration detention. In the Trump administration’s view, the government cannot hold children in immigration detention for over 20 days. That meant that if adults were sent to jail or long-term indefinite detention while their asylum requests or removal orders were processed, the children could not stay with them. As a result, the Trump policy of prosecuting adults has also led to a practice of separating families and holding children separately while trying to place them with relatives or in a licensed facility. No. His order explicitly states that the executive branch will continue to criminally prosecute people who cross the border illegally, signaling that the zero-tolerance policy remains in place. The order states that it is now the policy of the Trump administration to keep families together. It appears to envision a system in which families will be housed together in ad hoc detention centers, including on military bases, that the administration hopes a court will approve. It calls for many agencies — including the Pentagon — to make available “existing facilities,” or to construct them, for the Department of Homeland Security to use “for the housing and care of alien families.” "
411,"The investigation into President Trump’s former lawyer and “fixer” Michael D. Cohen has ensnared the publisher of The National Enquirer, further thrusting the media company into a federal inquiry involving a onetime top lieutenant to a sitting president. Prosecutors with the Southern District of New York subpoenaed executives at the publisher, American Media, this spring, according to people who have been briefed about the move but agreed to share the details about it only on the condition of anonymity. The prosecutors had already asked for communications between Mr. Cohen and American Media’s chairman, David J. Pecker, and its chief content officer, Dylan Howard. That request was part of a search warrant they secured for Mr. Cohen’s home, office, hotel room and electronic devices in April. The people familiar with the investigation said prosecutors sought similar communications from Mr. Howard and Mr. Pecker. During the presidential campaign, American Media had arranged  to effectively silence Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump years earlier, with a $150,000 payout. The payment caught the attention of investigators conducting a broad investigation into Mr. Cohen’s efforts on behalf of Mr. Trump during the campaign, as well as his own business dealings. It is also the subject of a complaint at the Federal Election Commission. "
412,"You just can’t construct prisons for babies. You can’t rip children from mothers and fathers. You can’t use the power of the American government to institute and oversee a program of state-sponsored child abuse. You can’t have a system where the process and possibility of reunification is murky and maybe futile. You can’t do any of that and assume that decent people won’t rise up in revolt. Donald Trump learned that this week as an avalanche of indignation came down on him and his administration for his brutal, inhumane “zero tolerance” policy at the border, which was resulting in the terrible suffering of children and their parents. Citizens were outraged. Politicians were outraged. Corporate leaders were outraged. Foreign leaders were outraged. The pope was outraged. This is an immoral act of an immoral man, one who saw absolutely no flaw in using the anguish of children and families — people he viewed as deficient and less-than, “not their best” — as pawns in a political fight to force Congress to fund his ridiculous hate symbol: a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. He clearly didn’t even think that this was a losing battle for him. He thought using border agents to abduct these children was a winning idea. On Wednesday, The Associated Press reported: “President Donald Trump sees his hard-line immigration stance as a winning issue heading into a midterm election he views as a referendum on his protectionist policies.” "
413,"The Trump administration’s inhumane treatment of immigrant children has left a dark stain on the history of our nation. It is a human tragedy and a threat to our values. On Wednesday, President Trump signed an executive order rolling back his own policy of separating parents from their children — claiming to solve a problem that was of his own creation. But this order is no solution at all. It still leaves open the long-term detention of immigrant children, which would clearly violate federal law. Moreover, you can’t un-abuse the more than 2,300 children who have been separated from their parents at the border with the swipe of a pen. The administration’s family separation policy has already done potentially irreparable harm to those children who were used as pawns in the president’s political agenda. And the order includes no plan to reunite these children with their parents, something that should be done as quickly as possible. The potential toll on these children is heavy. Research shows that the trauma of forced separation can cause long-lasting physical and emotional effects on children, changing how they process information, react to stress and develop executive function and decision-making skills. Such stress could also make these children more prone to inflammation and disease as they grow to be adults. As the number of adverse childhood events increases, the risk of health problems such as obesity, alcoholism and depression later in life increases. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed to defend the policy by praising the resilience of refugees this week. But in fact, by separating such young children from their parents, the federal government may have undermined that argument: Research shows that trauma can inhibit the development of resilience. "
414,"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. Roller coasters, spinning teacups and dolphins beckoned just minutes away at Disney World. Instead, hundreds of people crammed into a Renaissance Hotel ballroom in Orlando, Fla. The crowd waited for The New York Times’s executive editor, Dean Baquet, and The Washington Post’s executive editor, Martin Baron — the headliners of the 2018 Investigative Reporters and Editors Conference — to speak. “It is like Coachella for journalists, because you’ve got a million stages and a million different acts going on — minus the music, and maybe with a lot more khakis,” Matt Pearce, a national reporter at The Los Angeles Times, said. Media outlets including The Times and The Post are pouring resources into investigative journalism, amassing data and documents with the goal of holding those in power accountable. “As an organization, we exist to train and support journalists doing watchdog work across all platforms,” said Doug Haddix, the executive director of IRE. IRE was formed in 1975, in the shadow of the Watergate scandal, by journalists who wanted to share tips about writing and reporting. The first conference, held a year later, drew 300 reporters to Indianapolis. This year, approximately 1,775 people from newspapers, websites and television channels worldwide were in Orlando. "
415,"The Secret Service is “aware” of a tweet attacking President Trump’s adolescent son that was posted by the actor Peter Fonda, a spokesman for the agency said on Wednesday. “We should rip Barron Trump from his mother’s arms and put him in a cage with pedophiles,” Mr. Fonda wrote in all caps, referring to the president’s 12-year-old son, in a recent post on Twitter that was later deleted. Mr. Fonda, 78, also wondered if such an act would prompt the first lady Melania Trump to “stand up against” her husband. The spokesman for the agency said that “as a matter of practice, the Secret Service does not confirm the existence or the status of an investigation.” In recent days, Mr. Fonda has used Twitter to urge mass protests and to rail against the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, which has separated immigrant children from parents who crossed illegally into the United States, a practice that drew wide-ranging criticism from both parties, including Mrs. Trump. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order intended to end the separation of families at the border by detaining parents with their children for an indefinite period. Mr. Fonda’s tweet “is sick and irresponsible,” Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, said in an email on Wednesday. She said the tweet had been reported to the Secret Service. His tweet also drew backlash from some on the right, including the president’s eldest son. Donald Trump Jr. responded to Mr. Fonda in a series of tweets on Wednesday, at one point calling Mr. Fonda a “sick individual,” “bully” and “coward.” "
416,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has railed against undocumented immigrants in recent days, branding many of them “murderers and thieves” who want to “infest our country.” Not long ago, he referred to them as “animals,” although he insisted he meant only those who join a violent gang. The president’s unpresidential language has become the standard for some on his team. This week his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, made a mocking noise, “womp womp,” when a liberal strategist raised the case of a 10-year-old girl with Down syndrome separated from her parents at the border. Mr. Trump’s coarse discourse increasingly seems to inspire opponents to respond with vituperative words of their own. Whether it be Robert De Niro’s four-letter condemnation at the Tony Awards or a congressional intern who shouted the same word at Mr. Trump when he visited the Capitol this week, the president has generated so much anger among his foes that some are crossing boundaries that he himself shattered long ago. The politics of rage that animated Mr. Trump’s political rise now dominate the national conversation, as demonstrated repeatedly during the debate over his “zero tolerance” immigration policy that separated children from parents apprehended at the border. “Unfortunately, we’ve seen a decline in civility and an uptick in incivility,” said Christine Porath, a Georgetown University professor and author of “Mastering Civility,” a book on behavior in the workplace. “It seems like people are not only reciprocating, but we tend to stoop lower rather than higher. It’s really putting us in an unfortunate place.” Ms. Porath said the current harsh climate was affecting people beyond politics, injecting itself into everyday life at home and work. “We know that incivility is contagious,” she said. “It’s like a bug or virus. It’s not only when people experience incivility, it’s when they see or read about it.” "
417,"— Vice President Mike Pence, meeting with members of Congress on Wednesday. — President Trump, speaking to the National Federation of Independent Businesses on Tuesday. — Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, at a news conference on Monday. The Trump administration, defending its “zero tolerance” immigration policy that has resulted in separating families, has repeatedly pointed to a “crisis of illegal immigration” at the border. But government data shows that monthly crossings along the border with Mexico are dramatically lower than they were years ago. The most commonly used metric to measure how many people are illegally crossing into the United States is the number of people who are arrested, taken into custody or otherwise “apprehended” at or near the country’s borders. From the 1980s to the mid-2000s, the government reported annually apprehending around 1 million to 1.6 million foreigners who illegally entered the United States at the southwestern border. In 2000 alone, federal agents apprehended between 71,000 and 220,000 migrants each month. By comparison, monthly border crossings so far this year have ranged from 20,000 to 40,000 people. The number of people who have been either apprehended or turned away at the southwestern border also has decreased over the past decade. Mr. Trump, Mr. Pence and Ms. Nielsen are right that there has been a significant increase in border crossings in the past few months when compared with the same period in 2017. Last month, for example, Customs and Border Protection reported arresting or denying entry to 51,912 migrants at the southwestern border, compared with 19,940 in May 2017. But federal agents arrested or stopped 55,442 people in May 2016, 40,681 in May 2015 and 68,804 in May 2014, according to Customs and Border Protection. Similarly, apprehensions of unaccompanied children and families have surged this year from last spring’s border traffic. But the numbers are less dramatic when compared with before Mr. Trump took office. Customs and Border Protection apprehended 6,400 unaccompanied children and 9,500 individuals traveling as families this May — up from 1,500 unaccompanied children and 1,600 family members in May 2017. At the peak of the Central American migrant surge in 2014, Customs and Border Protection reported apprehending 10,600 children and 12,800 families who entered the United States at the southwestern border. "
418,"CASTROVILLE, Tex. — In the three years since Donald J. Trump began his presidential bid by maligning Mexican immigrants, Representative Will Hurd, a Texas Republican in a Democratic-leaning district, has faced voters of all stripes who were angry about Mr. Trump’s divisive style. But Mr. Hurd, who represents a heavily Hispanic region that stretches across 800 miles of the Mexican border, could not recall a moment when people were as appalled as they were over the images of anguished children separated from their migrant parents. “All the calls and emails I’ve gotten in my office are from constituents saying: ‘Why are we doing this, this is against our values,’” Mr. Hurd said. The president’s policy had damaged the Republican brand, he said, because “nobody understands why you would take children out of their parents’ hands.” Yet many rank-and-file Republican voters in border states see it differently, creating another kind of pressure for lawmakers like Mr. Hurd. Whatever sympathy these voters feel for the children is complicated, they say, by their intense frustration over the flow of migrants from Mexico. In interviews across the Southwest and Florida on Wednesday, many Republicans said that they appreciated President Trump’s emphasis on “zero tolerance” for illegal border crossings, and wished there were as much furor over those immigrants as there was over the separation of parents and children — an administration policy that Mr. Trump reversed under pressure from Republicans like Mr. Hurd. “You don’t ever want to be separating families, but at least the president focused attention on all the people crossing the border illegally,” said Helen Delavan, 79, a retired school secretary in Castroville, Tex., and a supporter of both Mr. Trump and Mr. Hurd. "
419,"DULUTH, Minn. — Shortly after caving to political pressure and signing an executive order that ends the separation of families by detaining parents and children together at the border, President Trump vowed at a rally here on Wednesday that his administration would be “just as tough” on immigration as before. The president was here in part to support Pete Stauber, a Republican candidate for a House seat. But, as he usually does on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump focused more on his agenda — and his enemies, at one point declaring that he had “a much better apartment” than his critics. Turning to immigration, Mr. Trump castigated the Democrats. “The Democrats want open borders: ‘Let everybody pour in, we don’t care,’” he said, as the crowd erupted into a chant of “Build the Wall,” and mocked a handful of people who tried to protest his policy. (“Go home to your mom,” the president told at least one demonstrator.) He said of other countries: “They’re not sending their finest. We’re sending them the hell back. That’s what we’re doing.” Mr. Trump traveled to Duluth, a shipping town on the shores of Lake Superior, after a week in Washington in which criticism over his child-separation policy had reached a fever pitch. "
420,"WASHINGTON — The Senate rejected on Wednesday a White House plan to rescind nearly $15 billion in unspent funding that had been approved in past years. Two Republican senators joined Democrats to defeat what had been a largely symbolic effort. The package of cuts, which President Trump had promoted as “historic,” amounted to a gesture of fiscal responsibility after the passage in March of a $1.3 trillion spending bill that agitated conservatives. Yet the plan to rescind unused funds would have had limited practical effect, as much of the funding was not expected to be spent anyway. The Congressional Budget Office said the bill would have reduced actual spending by only $1.1 billion over the next decade. By contrast, the deficit for just the current fiscal year is projected to near $800 billion. A procedural vote on the bill failed in the Senate, with 48 senators in favor and 50 opposed. The two Republicans voting no were Richard M. Burr of North Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine. The House had narrowly approved the measure, known as a rescissions package, this month. Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, lamented the bill’s rejection. “It is disappointing that the Senate chose to reject this common-sense plan,” he said in a statement, “and the American people should be asking their representatives in Washington one simple question: If they cannot pass good-government legislation to recapture unnecessary funds, how can we ever expect them to address Washington’s staggering debt and deficit problem?” Mr. Burr objected to a $16 million cut to conservation funds, according to an aide. Ms. Collins expressed opposition on institutional grounds. “I don’t like tipping the power of the purse to the executive branch,” she said. Democrats were united against the bill, which would have rescinded $7 billion in funds for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, though the budget office said actual spending on the program would not have been affected. As he criticized the bill, Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, offered a reminder of the deficit-widening tax overhaul that Republicans passed last year and that the White House has celebrated. Mr. Leahy urged his colleagues to vote no. “Congress decides spending priorities,” he said, “not the president.” "
421,"In Baltimore, the health commissioner, Dr. Leana Wen, uses a need-based algorithm to decide which emergency rooms, needle-exchange vans, E.M.T.s and opioid outreach workers receive the city’s limited supply of naloxone — and which don’t. The drug, which reverses overdoses, has saved some 14,000 Baltimore residents since 2015. But its price has increased in recent years, by between 95 and 500 percent, depending on which version of the medication is being considered. Even with donations and discounts from drug makers, Dr. Wen says the city can’t afford all the naloxone it needs. In Louisiana, the state secretary of health, Dr. Rebekah Gee, says that officials must weigh the number of hepatitis C patients they could cure with new medications against a host of other priorities, like infrastructure and universal preschool. The drugs’ list prices run from $26,400 to $96,000 per person. Roughly 2.7 million Americans suffer from hepatitis C, a painful, often deadly infection spread mainly through injection drug use; roughly 20,000 of them are Louisiana residents who receive health care through state-funded programs. Even with various discounts, Dr. Gee says she cannot treat everyone on the state’s rosters. Such calculations are being made everywhere, and not just because of the opioid crisis. Twenty-somethings fresh off their parents’ health insurance are rationing insulin; seniors are choosing between heart medications and groceries. Lives are laid to waste as cures stand at the ready. One possible solution involves an obscure part of federal law known as Section  1498. The provision acts as a sort of eminent domain for patented inventions, allowing the government to circumvent patent protections as long as the patent holder is fairly compensated. In the case of a pharmaceutical, the Department of Health and Human Services can authorize a drug maker to produce a low-cost generic version, which it could then buy in bulk. Both Dr. Gee and Dr. Wen have asked the government to consider invoking the law to address the twin epidemics of opioid overdoses and hepatitis C. In the late 1950s and 1960s, the federal government routinely used 1498 to obtain vital medications at a discount. According to a paper in The Yale Journal of Law and Technology, it enabled the Department of Defense to save a total of $21 million on 50 drugs in one three-year period. But the law fell out of use, some say as a result of the pharmaceutical industry’s growing influence on Capitol Hill. In 2017, drug makers deployed 882 lobbyists and spent more than $171.5 million, thwarting efforts to lower prescription drug prices. "
422,"If you want to understand American politics today, starting with the prospects for the 2018 midterm elections, you need to know Jim Domen. By the time he was in middle school, Mr. Domen knew he was different. His attraction to boys confused him. He knew it would shock his parents, born-again Christians. “I tried to read the Bible, and I prayed to change the sinful desires,” Mr. Domen told a radio interviewer in 2013. He tried dating girls, but that didn’t work either. When he eventually told his parents, they were “devastated,” he has said. They ordered him to seek treatment from a Christian counselor, but his attractions persisted. For several years in his 20s, Mr. Domen has said, he had a relationship with a man. After the couple split up, Mr. Domen enrolled as a seminary student at Azusa Pacific University, an evangelical Christian university in Azusa, Calif., and it was there that his life changed at last. He met his future wife; took a job at the California Family Council, an affiliate of Focus on the Family, an organization that promotes “biblical” answers to America’s social problems; and worked toward the passage of Proposition 8, California’s 2008 statewide ballot initiative stating that “only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.” From 2011 to 2014, Mr. Domen was a leader of Multisport Ministries, a national men’s athletic ministry that encourages men “to win as God’s men, competing in the character of Christ.” His transformation, he has said, was helped along by “hanging around healthy heterosexual men really teaching me on what it is to be a true man, the true masculinity.” Mr. Domen’s Twitter bio reads: “Pastor, Ironman, Husband, Daddy, Triathlete and Deplorable. I want the world to know I live for the glory of Jesus Christ.” Since 2014, Mr. Domen has been leading Church United, a group he founded with the aim of “helping pastors transform California at the government and church level.” If the Republican Party holds on to its congressional majority in 2018 and the presidency in 2020, it will be thanks in part to the efforts of Mr. Domen and others like him. "
423,"President Trump will meet Queen Elizabeth II during his long-delayed first trip to Britain next month, the United States ambassador to Britain said on Wednesday, an encounter that could reignite furor among British critics who oppose his deeply divisive policies and his polarizing personality. The ambassador, Robert Wood Johnson, announced the planned encounter in an interview with Sky News, the British broadcaster. He said while the details were still being worked out, they include a meeting with the monarch. “Yes, yes, I mean, he has to see the head of state,” Mr. Johnson said. “Putting his foot on British soil, it’s Job 1, it’s very important, very symbolic. Meeting Her Majesty is the most important thing, because she’s the head of state, and from then on, it’ll be what the president wants to do.” Mr. Trump is said to have described his mother, a native of Scotland, as a “big fan” of the queen, according to The Sunday Times of London. But not everyone is so excited. Outrage at Mr. Trump, who is deeply unpopular in Europe, has mounted over the past week amid the worldwide attention on the American government’s practice of separating children from their undocumented migrant parents along the United States-Mexico border. (Mr. Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday, rescinding the practice.) “In the last 3 days President Trump has backed the caging of children, talked of migrants ‘infesting’ the country, withdrawn from the UN Human Rights Council, made repeated lies about crime in Germany and we are honouring him with a visit to Windsor Castle to meet the Queen,” a British lawyer and political commentator, Peter Stefanovic, wrote on Twitter. "
424,"We now know the sound it makes when human decency dies on live cable news: “Womp womp.” That was the sound that the former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski made Tuesday night during a Fox News segment on the Trump administration policy of separating immigrant parents from their children at the border. He made it when a Democratic strategist, Zac Petkanas, told the story of a 10-year-old girl with Down syndrome who was taken from her mother in Texas. Womp womp. You may know the noise by the name “sad trombone” — a horn sound you use to mock a sob story. It’s a kind of trolling. And trolling is what Mr. Lewandowski gets booked on TV to do, this time by Fox, in the past by CNN. He’s the guy you can count on to taunt and revile the president’s enemies or perceived enemies. This time, the enemy was a disabled girl. And this time, Mr. Lewandowski seemed aware enough of how bad it looked that by Wednesday morning, he — well, of course he didn’t apologize (he made a point of not doing so), but he reframed his remarks, on Fox and on social media: There is no particular reason to take Mr. Lewandowski’s self-serving explanation over the video evidence. But let’s do it for argument’s sake. O.K.: He wasn’t mocking a girl being taken from her mother. He was “mocking a liberal” — for empathizing with a girl being taken from her mother. Actually, Mr. Lewandowski’s term was “politicizing.” Of course a separation created by White House policy is already political, especially when that White House sees electoral benefit in it. The “politicizing,” apparently, comes when you ask the audience to feel bad about it. "
425,"Under cover of darkness and in the custody of the federal government, migrant children have been coming in waves to New York, taken from their parents after crossing the southern border. Even as President Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday ending his administration’s policy of separating parents and children who have illegally crossed the border, the crisis was already spreading to a city some 2,000 miles away. Speaking outside Cayuga Centers in Harlem, one of a group of social service agencies in the state that contract with the federal government to take in unaccompanied minors, Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday afternoon said 350 children had come through the center and that 239 of them were currently in Cayuga’s care; the agency is not residential, but places children in temporary foster care and runs day programs. The children included a 9-year-old boy from Honduras who had come alone on a bus from Texas, and a child as young as 9 months old, Mr. de Blasio said, as he issued a scathing rebuke of the Trump administration. “How is it possible that none of us knew that there were 239 kids right here in our own city?” he asked. “How is the federal government holding back that information from the people of this city and holding back the help these kids could need?” "
426,"BEIJING — Propaganda departments in China and North Korea were in full swing on Wednesday as Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, concluded a two-day tour of China that painted the once-reclusive autocrat as a forward-looking leader. After meeting with President Xi Jinping and briefing him on the summit meeting with President Trump in Singapore last week, the North Korean leader was portrayed in the Chinese state media as eager to learn how to turn a developing nation into a global superpower. In North Korea, a propaganda machine that for decades turned out anti-American slogans and that denigrated South Koreans struck a new conciliatory tone, publishing posters this week that heralded unity on the Korean Peninsula. Before his plane took off in the late afternoon, Mr. Kim made “on the spot” inspections of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and a subsidiary of the Beijing Infrastructure Investment Company on his second day in the capital. Both organizations are part of China’s ambitious “One Belt, One Road” initiative, created to spread the country’s global influence by lending other countries money for big infrastructure projects built by Chinese companies. The agriculture academy specializes in machinery, animal disease prevention and seed production for hybrid rice and corn, according to its website. These are all things that North Korea badly needs. "
427,"ROME — Before President Trump’s about-face on Wednesday, Pope Francis criticized the administration’s separation of migrant children from their parents, saying in an interview earlier this week that “populism is not the solution” to a migration crisis that is transforming global politics. In a rare sit-down interview, Francis told Reuters that “I am on the side” of the United States’ Catholic bishops’ conference, which called taking children from their parents “immoral” and “contrary to our Catholic values.” In the face of mounting outrage, Mr. Trump had been sticking to a “zero-tolerance” policy intended to deter illegal immigration by prosecuting all adults apprehended crossing the United States border and putting their children in separate government-run shelters, including behind chain-link cage fencing. By some counts, the government has separated nearly 2,000 children from their families in the past six weeks. But on Wednesday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to prevent children from being taken from their parents. Francis has been a consistent, and increasingly lonely, advocate for migrants in a decreasingly tolerant globe. He told Reuters that populists capitalizing on the migration crisis to rise to power were “creating psychosis” on the issue. The pope argued that European countries with dwindling populations were entering what he called “a great demographic winter.” Without migrants, he said, Europe “will become empty.” "
428,"WASHINGTON — Long one of President Trump’s most ardent defenders, the evangelist Franklin Graham voiced strenuous dissent this week about the practice of separating families at the border, even calling it “disgraceful.” His comments, along with other criticism from the evangelical community, raised the possibility that the president’s support from conservative Christians might erode as outrage mounted over the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance” immigration policy. But if evangelical leaders were pained by the sight of children being taken from their parents, they did not directly fault Mr. Trump. Instead, many blamed Congress and past administrations, Republican and Democrat, and emphasized that Mr. Trump called family separation “horrible” in a tweet and that he wanted a legislative fix for immigration. And though it is too early to know the electoral consequences of the policy, few conservative Christian political leaders have been concerned that Mr. Trump will lose support among their ranks, which represent one of his most important voting blocs. “This is not the administration’s fault,” Mr. Graham said in an interview on Monday, while reiterating his stance against family separation. “I don’t point the finger at Trump.’’ . But even Mr. Trump, after weeks of pushing his administration’s policy and asserting, wrongly, that current law required family separation, retreated on Wednesday afternoon. He signed an executive order to end his administration’s policy of separating families and instead said they could be detained together indefinitely. The order said that officials would continue to criminally prosecute all who cross the border illegally, and it may face a legal challenge. Mr. Graham had also accused lawmakers of visiting detention centers for political gain, after recent high-profile trips by Democrats. “This administration is extremely concerned,” Mr. Graham said before votes in Congress on two immigration proposals expected this week. “They’ve got to have some Democrats cross the aisle.” "
429,"WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Wednesday that the House would press ahead with a vote on a broad immigration bill that includes language to curb the Trump administration’s practice of separating families on the border. “We don’t think families should be separated, period,” Mr. Ryan said. “We’ve seen the videos, heard the audio.” But doubts persisted about the bill’s chances of passage when it comes up for a vote on Thursday, and Senate Republicans were pursuing a different strategy. In that chamber, lawmakers were working to develop narrow legislation that would address the issue of separating families on the border. For now, at least, Mr. Ryan declined to entertain the possibility of considering a narrower measure aimed at stopping the separation of migrant families. “Right now, we’re focused on passing this legislation that’s coming to the floor tomorrow,” Mr. Ryan said. The House measure, a compromise negotiated by conservatives and moderates, was not originally conceived to address the issue of children being separated from parents who come into the United States illegally. It would provide a path to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, while making significant changes to the immigration system and providing billions of dollars for President Trump’s promised wall along the southwest border with Mexico. In light of the family separation issue, though, House Republicans added new language to the bill in an effort to address that matter. The legislation would keep families together when people are being prosecuted under the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy for illegally crossing the border, Mr. Ryan told reporters. The speaker said that families would remain together in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security while legal proceedings play out. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Mr. Ryan said. “The administration says it wants Congress to act, and we are.” It is highly questionable whether the compromise bill will be able to pass the House. The bill was negotiated as House leaders tried to head off a rebellion from moderate members eager for action to address the fate of the Dreamers. Critics on the right have already labeled it as “amnesty.” "
430,"In the preface to her 1968 collection of essays, “Men in Dark Times,” Hannah Arendt wrote: “Even in the darkest of times we have the right to expect some illumination.” Today, in our own dark time, Arendt’s work is being read with a new urgency, precisely because it provides such illumination. Born in Germany in 1906, Arendt studied with prominent philosophers of her time, but fled the country in 1933, living for a time in Paris, and later, in the United States. She is best known for her major works, including “The Human Condition,” “On Violence,” “Truth and Politics,” “The Origins of Totalitarianism” and especially “Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil,” which grew out of her coverage of the trial of the Nazi Adolf Eichmann for The New Yorker. She was remarkably perceptive about some of the deepest problems, perplexities and dangerous tendencies in modern political life, many of them still with us today. When she speaks of “dark times” and warns of the “exhortations, moral and otherwise, that under the pretext of upholding old truths degrade all truth in meaningless triviality” we can hear not only a critique of the horrors of 20th-century totalitarianism, but also a warning about forces pervading the politics of the United States and Europe today. Arendt was one of the first major political thinkers to warn that the ever-increasing numbers of stateless persons and refugees would continue to be an intractable problem. One of Arendt’s early articles, the 1943 essay “We Refugees,” based on her personal experiences of statelessness, raises fundamental questions. In it, she graphically describes what it means to lose one’s home, one’s language and one’s occupation, and concludes with a more general claim about the political consequences of the new mass phenomenon — the “creation” of masses of people forced to leave their homes and their country: “Refugees driven from country to county represent the new vanguard of their peoples … The comity of European peoples went to pieces when, and because, it allowed its weakest member to be excluded and persecuted.” When Arendt wrote this she could scarcely have realized how relevant her observations would be in 2018. Almost every significant political event during the past 100 years has resulted in the multiplication of new categories of refugees, and there appears to be no end in sight. There are now millions of people in refugee camps with little hope that they will be able to return to their homes or ever find a new one. In her 1951 work, “The Origins of Totalitarianism,” Arendt wrote of refugees: “The calamity of the rightless is not that they are deprived of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, or of equality before the law and freedom of opinion, but that they no longer belonged to any community whatsoever.” The loss of community has the consequence of expelling a people from humanity itself. Appeals to abstract human rights are meaningless unless there are effective institutions to guarantee these rights. The most fundamental right is the “right to have rights.” "
431,"President Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday after a national outcry over the “zero tolerance” immigration policy that was forcibly separating migrant families along the border. The following is the language of that order, as released by the White House. [Read the latest coverage of the zero-tolerance immigration policy and how Washington is responding.] ___________________ Affording Congress an Opportunity to Address Family Separation Issued on: June 20, 2018 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. It is the policy of this Administration to rigorously enforce our immigration laws. Under our laws, the only legal way for an alien to enter this country is at a designated port of entry at an appropriate time. When an alien enters or attempts to enter the country anywhere else, that alien has committed at least the crime of improper entry and is subject to a fine or imprisonment under section 1325(a) of title 8, United States Code. This Administration will initiate proceedings to enforce this and other criminal provisions of the INA until and unless Congress directs otherwise. It is also the policy of this Administration to maintain family unity, including by detaining alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources. It is unfortunate that Congress’s failure to act and court orders have put the Administration in the position of separating alien families to effectively enforce the law. Sec. 2. Definitions. For purposes of this order, the following definitions apply: (a) “Alien family” means (i) any person not a citizen or national of the United States who has not been admitted into, or is not authorized to enter or remain in, the United States, who entered this country with an alien child or alien children at or between designated ports of entry and who was detained; and (ii) that person’s alien child or alien children. (b) “Alien child” means any person not a citizen or national of the United States who "
432,"TORNILLO, Tex. — Late last week a sprawling tent city opened in Tornillo, outside El Paso. It is surrounded by chain-link fencing topped with barbed wire and hemmed in between the Rio Grande and I-10. Like several others along the United States-Mexico border, the Tornillo facility is intended to hold children apprehended for entering this country illegally. But it’s also different. The other facilities, like the converted Walmart in Brownsville, are the equivalent of short-term holding cells where parents and children are separated and then processed out to other facilities. In contrast, the Tornillo facility, already home to perhaps dozens of teenage boys — very little is known about it, and no reporters have been allowed inside — will hold hundreds of minors, possibly for months at a time. Whatever the federal government chooses to call it, this is an internment camp. (On Wednesday President Trump said he was preparing an executive order “keeping families together.”) Much of West Texas has been turned into a new front in the Trump administration’s war on undocumented immigrants. And wars take prisoners. Some 900 adult immigrants are locked up in the El Paso County jail. Children are held at facilities run by a private outfit, Southwest Key Programs. The government is reportedly planning to incarcerate still more people on military bases in El Paso, Abilene and San Angelo. Like a lot of wars, too, this one is long on secrecy. When I approached the facility, I was brusquely told to leave. The local Customs and Border Protection spokesman claimed to know nothing about the camp, just steps out his station’s backdoor. The Health and Human Services Department returned no phone calls. Representative Beto O’Rourke, a Democrat from El Paso who led a march here Sunday, was told he would need to wait two weeks for an appointment; his colleague, Joe Kennedy III of Massachusetts, was simply turned away. However, Representative Will Hurd, a Republican whose district includes Tornillo, and State Representative Mary Gonzalez, a Democrat who also represents Tornillo, did get into the camp late Friday night. In an interview, Ms. Gonzalez described inmates as 16- and 17-year-old boys, assigned 20 to a tent for sleep. A big tent, closest to the gate, serves as mess hall. All are air-conditioned. The place is livable, she said — but “also dehumanizing.” In a handful of photos released by the Department of Homeland Security on Monday, the metal, military-style bunks are stacked one on top of the other; the tent ceiling seems close enough to touch from the top bunk. The mess hall is brightly lit and furnished with folding chairs and plastic folding tables. The photos show a dozen smaller tents on concrete and with a yard of gravel and portable toilets outside, where temperatures this week will soar into the hundreds. There are one or two command posts — one was trucked in from the Texas state government — as well as an ambulance, medical van, caseworkers, therapists and nurse practitioners, according to Representative Gonzalez. A soccer goal stands on a dirt field. "
433,"The Hungarian Parliament approved a package of laws on Wednesday that criminalizes the act of helping undocumented migrants and creates a parallel court system that some fear will be used for politically sensitive cases, accelerating efforts by Prime Minister Viktor Orban to transform the country into what he calls an “illiberal democracy.” The government named the legislation the “Stop Soros” bill, after the Hungarian-American financier and philanthropist George Soros, who has helped Hungarian rights organizations. It must be signed into law by President Janos Ader before it can take effect. The laws are the first major measures to be passed since Mr. Orban, who campaigned on a nationalist, anti-immigrant platform, led his far-right party, Fidesz, to an increased parliamentary majority in April, in an election that observers said was free but not fair. Their passage came on World Refugee Day, five days after Mr. Orban spoke by telephone with President Trump, who came under intense criticism in the United States for his policy of separating migrant children from their parents, and incarcerating them, after they cross the southern American border. Mr. Orban has been Europe’s most prominent critic of open-door migration since the Continent’s refugee crisis in 2015, putting him at odds with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose government welcomed hundreds of thousands of mainly Syrian and Afghan refugees that year. In 2015, over a million asylum seekers landed by boat on European shores, many of them later passing through Hungary on their way to Germany. To stop their passage, Mr. Orban built a fence along Hungary’s southern border, a move that foreshadowed Mr. Trump’s plans to extend a wall along the American border with Mexico. "
434,"News item #1: The Trump administration is taking thousands of children away from their parents, and putting them in cages. News item #2: House Republicans have released a budget plan that would follow up last year’s big tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy with huge funding cuts for Medicare and Medicaid. If you think these items are unrelated, you’ve missed the whole story of modern American politics. Conservatism – the actually existing conservative movement, as opposed to the philosophical stance whose constituency is maybe five pundits on major op-ed pages — is all about a coalition between racists and plutocrats. It’s about people who want to do (2) empowering people who want to do (1), and vice versa. Until Trump, the ugliness of this deal was cloaked in euphemisms. As Lee Atwater famously put it, But the reality was always there. The conservative economic agenda has never been popular, and it is objectively against the interests of working class voters, whatever their race. In fact, whites without a college degree are the biggest beneficiaries of the social safety net. Nonetheless, these voters supported the GOP because it spoke to their racial animosity. Now, to be fair, for a long time the GOP establishment managed to pull off a kind of bait-and-switch with this strategy, using race to motivate voters who would otherwise oppose its agenda, then putting the racism back in the closet once in office. George W. Bush did a lot of terrible things, but give him this much credit: he tried to dampen the xenophobia that was trying to break out after 9/11, rather than fanning the flames. "
435,"KABUL, Afghanistan — At least 30 Afghan soldiers were killed in a single Taliban attack in the northwest of the country early Wednesday, officials said, indicating an end to a brief lull in violence after both sides agreed to unilateral cease-fires. Taliban fighters launched heavy attacks on three army outposts in the Bala Murghab district of Badghis Province, said the provincial governor, Abdul Ghafoor Malakzai. The initial attacks were repelled, but the reinforcements the government sent in were hit by roadside bombs, he said. Saleh Mohammed Khan, a local police commander in Bala Murghab, said that at least 30 soldiers were killed in the attacks and that two outposts were overrun. “The Taliban also lost six people, and four of them were wounded,” Mr. Khan said. “The fighting continued from 1:30 a.m. until the morning. Two units fell, and one other is surrounded.” Days before the attack, photographs shared on social media showed a large number of Taliban fighters waving white flags in Bala Murghab, mingling with crowds celebrating the cease-fire. "
436,"The shelters were intended for children under the age of 12, referred to as “tender age” detainees, who are entering the detention system in ever-larger numbers under the Trump administration’s practice of separating children from parents who enter the country illegally. Many are toddlers and babies and require special care, and their numbers have been rising since last month, when the government enforced a “zero tolerance” policy on people crossing the border. Estimates suggest that more than 2,400 children under the age of 12 are now in federal custody, including many who have been separated from their parents. But on Wednesday, faced with the intense criticism over the shelters and the separation of families, President Trump retreated, signing an executive order that would detain parents and children together. For now, it seems the separations will stop, but it remains unclear what will happen going forward. A Health and Human Services official said that children already separated will not be immediately reunited with their parents while the adults remain in custody during their immigration proceedings. The executive order came just hours after reports that three centers in southern Texas — in Brownsville, Combes and Raymondville — were being outfitted to accommodate younger children. A person inside a shelter in Brownsville, Tex., took a series of pictures and supplied them to The New York Times. The facility, which houses babies and toddlers, is operated by Southwest Key Programs, the same nonprofit group that operates a shelter at a former Walmart. One image showed a toddler girl who is about 12 months old, playing on a colorful mat decorated with the letters of the alphabet and drawings of animals. The workers and others standing around the little girl wear blue hospital-style bootees to keep the wooden floor clean. "
437,"TYRANT
Shakespeare on Politics
By Stephen Greenblatt
212 pp. W.W. Norton & Company. $21.95. Is Shakespeare our contemporary? Stephen Greenblatt would have us believe he is. Tormented by the rise to power of the current occupant of the White House, he has discerned in it a pattern chillingly reminiscent of that of the tyrants of the author whose work he has spent a lifetime studying. In groundbreaking books like “Hamlet in Purgatory” and “Will in the World,” he has, by exploring lesser-known areas of Elizabethan life and thought, thrown new light on these infinitely rich and endlessly subtle plays. In “Tyrant,” he reverses the process. Slyly and wittily, he analyzes political events in Shakespeare’s world in terms of our own experience. “The terrorists,” he writes of the Elizabethan Roman Catholic insurgency, “were not easy to identify, since most of them were homegrown. Having been radicalized, lured abroad to training camps, and then smuggled back into England, they blended easily into the mass of ordinary, loyal subjects.” Most of their recruits, he says, were drawn from “disaffected, unstable youths prone to dreams of violence and martyrdom.” Similarly, in his trenchant analysis of the power play in “Henry VI,” Greenblatt notes how the sudden eruption of hostility between the Dukes of Somerset and York precipitates “group solidarity and group loathing … which makes the voice, even the very thought, of the opponent almost unendurable.” Nobody is listening to anyone else, simply engaging in tribal chanting. Again and again, Greenblatt retells the familiar stories of Shakespeare’s egregious tyrants — Richard III, Macbeth, Julius Caesar, Coriolanus and, unexpectedly and acutely, Jack Cade, the rebel leader in “Henry VI, Part II” — in ways that unavoidably recall the situation in America today. Though Greenblatt never names the 45th president, he has, on his own admission, a severe case of the DTs. Virtually every paragraph of the book points to him: “Under what circumstances, Shakespeare asked himself,” do the “cherished institutions” of a free society, “seemingly deep-rooted and impregnable, suddenly prove fragile? Why do large numbers of people knowingly accept being lied to?” And of the populist fantasist: “Cade himself, for all we know, may think that what he is so obviously making up as he goes along will actually come to pass.” Greenblatt goes for the jugular with this particular parallel: “Drawing on an indifference to the truth, shamelessness and hyperinflated self-confidence, the loudmouthed demagogue is entering into a fantasyland — ‘When I am king, as king I will be’ — and he invites his listeners to enter the same magical space with him. In that space, two and two do not have to equal four, and the most recent assertion need not remember the contradictory assertion that was made a few seconds earlier.” “Richard III” offers even richer pickings. Dramatists have regularly enlisted the crookbacked Plantagenet as a paradigm of tyranny: Brecht, famously, in “Arturo Ui,” his cartoon of Hitler’s “resistible” rise to power, and the British dramatist David Edgar’s brutal assault on Richard Nixon in the multiply-punning “Dick Deterred.” In a powerful chapter, Greenblatt homes in less on the tyrant himself than on those who have allowed him to come to power — the enablers, as he calls them. He names and shames seven categories: those who are taken in by the tyrant; those who ignore him; those who believe that such a person could never come to power (“Richard is so obviously and grotesquely unqualified for the supreme position of power that they dismiss him from their minds”); those cowed by his bullying; those who believe they can control him (these are “among the first to go under, once Richard has used them to obtain his end”); those who happily take orders from anyone; and those who fall for “the big, bold lie.” There is one more corrosive category, the fascinated bystanders (in other words, everyone else): “Something in us enjoys every minute of his horrible ascent to power.” "
438,"WASHINGTON — President Trump caved to enormous political pressure on Wednesday and signed an executive order meant to end the separation of families at the border by detaining parents and children together for an indefinite period. “We’re going to have strong — very strong — borders, but we are going to keep the families together,” Mr. Trump said as he signed the order in the Oval Office. “I didn’t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated.” But ending the practice of separating families still faces legal and practical obstacles. A federal judge could refuse to give the Trump administration the authority it wants to hold families in custody for more than 20 days, which is the current limit because of a 1997 court order. And the president’s order does nothing to address the plight of the more than 2,300 children who have already been separated from their parents under the president’s “zero tolerance” policy. Federal officials initially said those children would not be immediately reunited with their families while the adults remain in federal custody during their immigration proceedings. “There will not be a grandfathering of existing cases,” said Kenneth Wolfe, a spokesman for the Administration for Children and Families, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. Wolfe said the decision about the children was made by the White House. But later Wednesday evening, Brian Marriott, the senior director of communications for the agency, said that Mr. Wolfe had “misspoke” and insisted that “it is still very early, and we are awaiting further guidance on the matter.” Mr. Marriott said that “reunification is always the goal” and that the agency “is working toward that” for the children separated from their families because of Mr. Trump’s policy. "
439,"LONDON — Fears of a Chinese takeover of companies important to national security have felled deals around the world both big and small. Now even the sale of a minor airplane parts maker is being closely examined for serious risks. In delaying the proposed takeover of the parts maker, Northern Aerospace, by a rival owned by a Chinese conglomerate, British government officials appear worried that even a small supplier to Airbus and Boeing could have important national security implications. It is the latest instance of countries around the world showing skepticism about Chinese money. Lawmakers in Washington are battling with President Trump over whether to lift penalties on ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications company whose phones were barred for sale on American military bases. And in Australia, lawmakers are considering whether to block Huawei, China’s biggest telecom company, from contracts to upgrade that country’s wireless networks to the next-generation 5G standard. Governments from the United States to Germany worry that China will effectively buy up the technologies it needs to create state-funded Chinese giants that would rival those from America and Europe. Over the past several years, regulators in Washington have quashed Chinese investments in American companies working on sensitive technology. This year, Mr. Trump blocked a $117 billion takeover bid for Qualcomm, the computer chip giant, amid concerns about American efforts to beat China in the race for 5G technology. And both the White House and lawmakers have proposed further tightening the process for reviewing foreign investments in American companies, with a particular eye toward China. [Read how China is gleaning technical know-how from foreign firms.] European countries have followed suit, with some calling for a stronger review process after a flurry of deals that gave Chinese purchasers access to innovative technology in areas like robotics. Even Canada, where Chinese investment has long been more welcomed, last month blocked a Chinese purchase of a construction company, citing national security. "
440,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Raises Stakes in Trade Conflict With a $200 Billion Threat” (Business Day, June 19): As President Trump stumbles toward an all-out trade war with China, most attention is being paid to the damaging effects it would have on the American economy, including many of his own supporters. But we also need to recognize the enormous effect it would likely have on China, a point Trump officials seek to emphasize (front page, June 20). For example, even after 25 years of scorching growth, the American economy remains more than a third larger than China’s, and American consumers remain the No. 1 target for Chinese exports. Factor in the $1.2 trillion in United States debt owned by China, and it’s clear which country has more to lose economically. Yet missing from the White House analysis are the political risks to President Xi Jinping, who staked his recent assumption of near-dictatorial powers on an ability to bring sustained economic growth and stability to China. Instead of disrupting this vision, he is far more likely to seek conciliation, including in vital sectors like emerging technologies. As any clear-thinking economist will tell you, trade wars are a fool’s errand. But perhaps out of all of this Trump bluster and brinkmanship, both sides will recognize the need for a better and fairer trade relationship, one that accounts for China’s impressive rise, and America’s legitimate grievances. STUART GOTTLIEB, NEW YORK The writer is an international affairs professor at Columbia University. "
441,"VIENNA — A meeting of major oil producers here in the Austrian capital has been dedicated to the theme of “cooperation for a sustainable future.” Soon after proceedings kicked off on Wednesday, though, the political tensions between them were laid bare. For months, the world’s main exporters of crude, including Iran, Iraq, Russia and Saudi Arabia, have worked together to curb their output to bolster oil prices. The uneasy coordination among several longtime rivals has helped sharply increase oil prices and slash what had been enormous supplies of unsold crude piling up in storage. But faced with angry broadsides from President Trump, who is seeking cooperation from Saudi Arabia to force gasoline prices lower ahead of midterm elections in the United States, that cooperation now looks to be fraying. At a conference arranged by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries grouping in Vienna, Iran’s oil minister delivered blunt remarks arguing that it was Washington — and not OPEC — that was to blame for the high oil prices Mr. Trump has railed against. “The real reason for the current oil price hike lies with the United States president himself,” Bijan Zanganeh, the Iranian minister, said in a speech. Referring to American sanctions against Iran and Venezuela, Mr. Zanganah added, “You cannot impose unilateral trade sanctions against two founding members of OPEC, two major oil producers, and at the same time expect the global market not to show adverse reaction.” “The United States cannot expect OPEC to act against two of its founding members,” he said. “On the contrary, OPEC is independent, mature and reasonable.” "
442,"Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, has decided to throw his political clout and personal fortune behind the Democratic campaign to take control of the House of Representatives this year, directing aides to spend tens of millions of dollars in an effort to expel Republicans from power. Mr. Bloomberg — a political independent who has championed left-of-center policies on gun control, immigration and the environment — has approved a plan to pour at least $80 million into the 2018 election, with the bulk of that money going to support Democratic congressional candidates, advisers to Mr. Bloomberg said. By siding so emphatically with one party, Mr. Bloomberg has the potential to upend the financial dynamics of the midterm campaign, which have appeared to favor Republicans up to this point. Facing intense opposition to President Trump and conservative policies, Republicans have been counting on a strong economy and heavily funded outside groups to give them a political advantage in key races, especially in affluent suburbs where it is expensive to run television ads. Mr. Bloomberg’s intervention is likely to undermine that financial advantage by bankrolling advertising on television, online and in the mail for Democratic candidates in a dozen or more congressional districts, chiefly in moderate suburban areas where Mr. Trump is unpopular. Democrats need to gain 23 congressional seats to win a majority. While Mr. Bloomberg has not chosen his list of targeted races yet, he is unlikely to get involved in rural, conservative-leaning districts where his views on guns and other issues could stir an uproar, according to people briefed on his plans, some of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. The new alliance between Mr. Bloomberg, 76, and congressional Democrats marks a fresh stage in the former mayor’s political evolution. And it promises to put New York and its political leaders even more squarely at the center of a midterm campaign already stocked with prominent characters from the city, including a president who made his fortune in Manhattan real estate; the top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer; and Mr. Bloomberg’s predecessor in Gracie Mansion, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who serves as a lawyer for Mr. Trump. "
443,"For months, Steve Schmidt, a longtime Republican strategist, has warned about the degradation of his party, saying the Trump administration is responsible for a “coarsening of this country” and calling the president a “useful idiot” for Russia. Now, Mr. Schmidt says he’s done: On Wednesday morning, he renounced his membership in the Republican Party, nearly three decades after joining it, and called for a Democratic wave in the midterm elections this fall. In a series of tweets, Mr. Schmidt, who served as a top campaign adviser to George W. Bush in 2004 and John McCain in 2008, said that the party he long served had become “corrupt, indecent and immoral.” He pointed to the Trump administration’s practice of separating children from their parents when apprehended at the border, saying it had resulted in “internment camps for babies.” “This child separation policy is connected to the worst abuses of humanity in our history,” Mr. Schmidt said, reflecting the larger outpouring of  anger over the administration’s zero-tolerance policy, which has included immigrants seeking asylum. “It is connected by the same evil that separated families during slavery and dislocated tribes and broke up Native American families,” Mr. Schmidt said. “It is immoral and must be repudiated.” He also accused several officials of being “complicit” in enabling the president’s policies, including Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security; Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader; and Speaker Paul D. Ryan. Save for a few governors, Mr. Schmidt said, the Republican Party is now filled with “feckless cowards.” He said that the few who deserved to be spared that label included Govs. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, Larry Hogan of Maryland and John Kasich of Ohio. As a result, Mr. Schmidt called for a Democratic wave in the midterms, describing that party as the only one remaining “that stands for what is right and decent.” “The first step to a season of renewal in our land is the absolute and utter repudiation of Trump and his vile enablers in the 2018 election by electing Democratic majorities,” Mr. Schmidt wrote. “I do not say this as an advocate of a progressive agenda. I say it as someone who retains belief in DEMOCRACY and decency.” Mr. Schmidt’s announcement was met with mixed emotions by liberals on social media, with some welcoming it and others suggesting the announcement was too little, too late. Some conservatives also scoffed at the defection. While his decision to renounce his membership in the Republican Party stands out, Mr. Schmidt is far from alone in rebuking his party’s leadership. Other prominent Republicans, such as Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, have been fiercely critical of President Trump and his policies — but have mostly continued to vote in line with Mr. Trump’s positions. "
444,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a member of the United Methodist Church who often draws on his religious background to govern, is facing a formal complaint from more than 600 fellow Methodists. The complaint says the Trump administration’s practice of separating families at the border would be considered “child abuse” under church law. Stories of children being taken from their parents and images of teenagers in cage-like detention facilities have turned into a crisis for the Trump administration, which announced plans on Wednesday to end the practice of family separation in illegal immigration cases. Families would be detained together indefinitely under the expected order, which could run afoul of a 20-day legal limit on how long children can be kept in detention. Last week, as the opposition was building, Mr. Sessions used a Bible passage to defend the “zero tolerance” policy, in a speech to law enforcement officers. Now he faces a complaint from within his own church, sent this week to his pastors in Alabama and Virginia. The formal notice starts a process that could in theory ultimately lead to Mr. Sessions’s termination from the church, though such an outcome would be extremely unlikely. "
445,"American Airlines asked the federal government on Wednesday to stop using its commercial planes for “transporting children who have been separated from their families due to the current immigration policy.” The announcement, which was posted on American’s website, was the latest fallout from the Trump administration’s decision to separate parents who have arrived at the southern border illegally from their children. Soon after American’s announcement, and similar statements by other major airlines, President Trump signed an executive order to end the separation of families and detain parents and children together. The involvement of the airline industry in the drama showed just how pervasive and passionate the opposition to the original policy had become. Several flight attendants for American, the world’s largest airline, had posted testimony on public and private social media channels in recent days, describing how they had seen groups of Latino children on domestic flights, accompanied not by parents but by federal agents. In a tweet Wednesday, Frontier Airlines stated that it would “not knowingly allow our flights to be used to transport migrant children away from their families.” United Airlines said it had told federal officials that they “should not transport immigrant children” who had been separated from their parents. Southwest Airlines asked that “anyone” involved in separating children from their parents not fly with them. A press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, Tyler Q. Houlton, said it was unfortunate that airlines “no longer want to partner with the brave men and women of D.H.S. to protect the traveling public, combat human trafficking, and to swiftly reunite unaccompanied illegal immigrant children with their families.” “Despite being provided facts on this issue, these airlines clearly do not understand our immigration laws and the longstanding devastating loopholes that have caused the crisis at our southern border,” Mr. Houlton said.

447,"GOTEBORG, Sweden — The European Union fought back on Friday against the Trump administration’s tariffs, slapping penalties on an array of American products that target the president’s political base, like bourbon, motorcycles and orange juice. The European counterattack on $3.2 billion of goods, a response to the administration’s measures on steel and aluminum imports, adds another front to a trade war that has engulfed allies and adversaries around the world. China and Mexico have already retaliated with their own tariffs, and Canada, Japan and Turkey are readying similar offensives. The risk of escalation is high since Mr. Trump has promised even more tariffs. Taking particular aim at German car manufacturers, the president has started an investigation into automobile imports to determine whether they pose a national security concern, the same justification used for his metal tariffs. “You look at the European Union,” the president told a crowd in Duluth, Minn., on Wednesday. “They put up barriers so that we can’t sell our farm products in. And yet they sell Mercedes and BMW, and the cars come in by the millions. And we hardly tax them at all.” He added in a tweet on Friday that he would place a 20 percent tariff on European cars, if the barriers “are not soon broken down.” The United States is fighting from a position of strength, with the American economy on track for one of its strongest years in a decade. Europe doesn’t have the same defenses. Growth in the region is slowing, and that weakness has been compounded by political turmoil in Italy and Germany, as well as Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. But in a trade war no sides are left unscathed. Although Mr. Trump has sought to exert pressure on other countries, the global nature of supply chains means the tit-for-tat tariffs are ricocheting in unexpected ways and may ultimately cost jobs in the United States. Sales of Mercedes S.U.V.s, made in Alabama by the German automaker Daimler, could be hit by the American trade dispute with China. The Swedish manufacturer Volvo faces rising prices on the imported steel it uses at its Mack Truck factory outside Allentown, Pa. "
448,"Perhaps you’ve come to wonder how tearing babies away from their mothers over a victimless misdemeanor came be the official policy of the United States government. It’s a question on a lot of our minds. Most of us are outraged and livid with shame that the savagery of “tender age” shelters was undertaken by our government, on our behalf. If we’re ready to say “never again,” we need to be willing to expose the roots of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy. We need to be willing to cut them out. Blame Donald Trump’s ruthless bigotry, sure. But when the president walked into the Oval Office, he walked into a ready-made, bipartisan immigration policy framework poised for brutality. Militarized borders, deportation squads, an archipelago of internment facilities, hypertrophied executive power, a lurid body of national security and anti-trafficking law sprung from the rich manure of panic — none of this is Mr. Trump’s handiwork. It was an inheritance. And now Mr. Trump has deployed this machinery of repression, bristling with Bush- and Obama-era upgrades, to take terrified innocents hostage. The administration sees the moral horror and basic decency of the American people as weakness it can exploit to extort concessions to its unpopular, hard-right agenda of ethnocultural population control. The president’s fresh executive order, falsely advertised as a reversal on family separation, is nothing but a ransom note. It amounts to a promise to continue ripping families apart unless settled legal protections for Mr. Trump’s child hostages are removed. Stephen Miller, the president’s trusted adviser, is enthusiastic about the possibility that scarring toddlers for life might rally the embattled president’s base and drive favorable midterm turnout. The White House’s nonchalance about using the suffering of children as a means to its political ends is beyond sickening. But a handful of memos altering internal executive agency policy could not have brought us so neatly to the point of kidnapping children and sticking them in warehouses, with no immediately obvious legal problem, if relatively unbounded executive discretion to inflict industrial-scale suffering weren’t already written into law, if decommissioned Walmarts hadn’t already been repurposed as prisons for immigrant kids, and if a moral and legal framework for the justification of this infrastructure had not been well entrenched. The keys to a cruel machine were handed over to a cruel and indecent man. Thousands of families are living inside a nightmare because we knew the machine could be cruelly and indecently used, but we went ahead and built it anyway. "
449,"Martin Shkreli is in prison, but Daraprim still costs $750 per pill. Heather Bresch was hauled before Congress, but EpiPens still cost three to six times more than they did in 2007. Every week we hear of a new outrageous drug price increase. In polls, some 80 percent of Americans say that government should do more to curb drug prices. Having proclaimed just before his inauguration that drug makers were “getting away with murder,” President Trump last month issued a 50-point blueprint to bring down prices, mainly by injecting more competition — and a dose of public shaming — into the market. Though the document was light on specifics, containing more than 130 questions, it included proposals for speeding the development and sale of generics, strengthening insurers’ negotiating clout, and making pricing more transparent. The administration apparently hopes that, with a nudge and prod, the market will control pharmaceutical pricing excesses. If history is a guide, it won’t. Competition may work well to lower the prices of baguettes and cars. But it has proved to have limited impact on American health care, especially when it comes to expensive interventions like prescription drugs. Exhibit A would be Novartis’s cancer drug Gleevec, a miracle when it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2001. It turned a deadly form of leukemia into a treatable disease. Today, people who are in remission after two years of taking the drug have a normal life expectancy. "
450,"WASHINGTON — Has any American spent more of her career flinging her arms up in shock and elation than Oprah Winfrey? Maybe — maybe — certain long-suffering and spoiled-rotten sports fans. But in 25 years of hosting a daytime talk show five days a week, nine months out of 12, often to gigantic ratings, Ms. Winfrey raised her arms a lot — over makeovers and giveaways and celebrity surprises, like that time, in 2011, nearing the final broadcast of “The Oprah Winfrey Show,” when she turned around and saw Stevie Wonder, at a piano, rising out of an arena floor. O.K., it was only one arm, but it went up with the force of two. Her reaction was part “buzzer beater,” part “pageant win.” She and her thousands of hours of TV are now the subjects of a big, fascinating exhibition at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture that captures what the show was, did and has meant. And it includes that Stevie Wonder moment, in a short montage focused on the show’s leap, in its final years, into lavish, thrill-a-minute mega-production. The installation — “Watching Oprah: The Oprah Winfrey Show and American Culture” — is what can only be called so Smithsonian: a mouthwatering, heartwarming, eye-opening, foot-aching conflation of biography, anthropology, sociology, nostalgia, history and insight (about culture, race, gender, technology, media, education, consumerism, economics, beauty, fashion and the law) into a potent dioramic spectacle. You leave it with a fuller understanding of Ms. Winfrey’s rare determination to matter to everybody and in awe of how acutely she still does. That bit with Mr. Wonder lasts about 15 seconds in the montage. But it sticks with you. For one thing, it exposes something endearingly normal in a woman, who as a very famous TV host, could presumably have had Mr. Wonder pop out of any floor anytime she wanted. For another, the women in the audience (thousands of them, black and white; I didn’t spot a single man) leap and shout and wail, with their arms in the air, in a dozen different ways, from “Lotto win” to “praise Jesus.” They’re going nuts for Mr. Wonder, obviously. But they might be more ecstatic about the joy he’s bringing Ms. Winfrey. This isn’t a cult, exactly. It’s a living, screaming symbiotic social network. Affirmation and intent became muscular cornerstones of the “Oprah Winfrey” enterprise. When she banged the “like” button, her vast constituency banged on it, too. "
451,"To the Editor: Re “Vote Secures Trump’s Grip on the G.O.P.” (front page, June 14): Both Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona are speaking out from the relative safety of not running again. If their dissent is sincere, why not declare independence from the Republicans and then caucus with the Democrats to wrest control of the Senate and provide a meaningful countervailing power to that of the presidency under Donald Trump? This would in no way detract from their Republican principles, since they can still vote their conscience on legislation. Perhaps some others with little to lose can be similarly persuaded. Although it is evidently too much to ask of Republicans to risk their careers in defense of honor, at least those with nothing to lose can put their money where their mouth is.

452,"The Democratic National Committee is undertaking an expansive, multimillion dollar strategic plan to motivate voters who typically sit out midterm elections, with a particular focus on engaging nonwhite communities through new investments in local organizing and a six-figure advertising campaign. The plan, which is set to be announced on Thursday, is likely the largest and most comprehensive effort ever by the Democratic Party to motivate minority voters in a midterm election year, according to aides and party insiders briefed on the new efforts. It includes $1.2 million split across 16 state parties to hire community organizers targeting groups who have been historically unlikely to vote — including black, Latino, Asian, millennial and rural voters. The plan also introduces a new database that seeks to identify 25 million likely Democratic voters who are currently unregistered and seemingly removed from the political process. The nearly $2.5 million total investment telegraphs the Democratic Party’s strategy in November’s midterm elections. Party leaders say they believe that President Trump’s history of igniting racial divisions has motivated America’s minorities to engage in the political sphere, so the Democrats are expanding their target demographic to include voters who have traditionally not been cultivated. “We are investing in our base communities, which are the heart of the Democratic Party, and putting organizers on the ground across the country because we know that’s the only way we’ll win,” said Tom Perez, the D.N.C. chairman. The greatest impact of the announcement, however, may be a symbolic one. More than just dollars, the new initiative comes with a tacit concession by party leaders who, after years of criticism from activists, are beginning to acknowledge that previous efforts to engage minority voters during nonpresidential election years may have been inadequate. “In certain times, the party has retreated from communities of color, but I think that page is now turned,” said Cristóbal Alex, the president of the Latino Victory Fund, a Democrat-aligned firm that trains and supports Latino political candidates nationwide.

453,"The Trumps and the Kushners are parting ways — not the White House power couple Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, but their family businesses on hotel collaborations in New Jersey, according to people briefed on the situation. Kushner Companies and the Trump Organization recently dropped plans for the Trumps to manage an oceanfront hotel that the Kushners are building at the Jersey Shore. The companies also terminated an arrangement that had the Trumps managing a hotel outside New York City in Mr. Kushner’s childhood hometown, Livingston, N.J. Ethics watchdogs had taken aim at President Trump and Mr. Kushner, the president’s senior adviser and son-in-law, for retaining stakes in their family businesses while the companies were financially entangled in New Jersey. The families’ dealmaking, the watchdogs suggested, could have influenced Mr. Trump’s judgment about Mr. Kushner’s role in the administration. And Bobby Burchfield, the Trump Organization’s outside ethics adviser, had also asked questions about the potential collaboration with the Kushners on the Jersey Shore property. While both sides were in agreement about the decision to forgo the deals, it is the latest frustration for the Trump Organization. Although the Kushners represented only a fraction of the Trump Organization’s overall business, the Westminster Hotel, the Kushner-owned property in Livingston, was one of the few new ventures undertaken by the Trump Organization since it adopted new ethics restrictions after Mr. Trump’s election. The company earned $20,000 in fees for managing the hotel for part of last year, according to the president’s financial disclosure last month. The Trumps have introduced two new, more affordable hotel brands in the last couple of years, Scion and American Idea, but have announced only one partner in the endeavors, in the Mississippi Delta. And in the 17 months since the president took office, the owners of struggling Trump hotels in Toronto and New York paid the Trump Organization millions of dollars to remove the family moniker from the properties. A feud with a hotel owner in Panama led to the Trump name’s being pried off with a crowbar. "
454,"WASHINGTON — The House rejected a hard-line immigration bill on Thursday and Republican leaders delayed a vote on a compromise measure that seemed destined to fail, then delayed it again, in the latest show of their party’s disarray over immigration. The compromise, a broad immigration overhaul negotiated by moderate and conservative Republicans, was supposed to be voted on early Thursday evening. It would provide a path to citizenship for young unauthorized immigrants while keeping migrant families together at the border, in addition to funding President Trump’s border wall. But with its prospects seeming dim, Republican leaders pushed the vote to Friday and huddled with their members in a last-ditch effort to stave off what would have been an embarrassing defeat. Then they delayed the vote again, to next week, as lawmakers discussed making additions to the legislation. The turbulent day in the House offered yet another reminder of the deep divisions over immigration vexing Republicans, with no easy solutions in sight. Looming in the background throughout was Mr. Trump, who attacked Democrats and complained on Twitter that they “don’t care about security” and “won’t vote for anything!” To some extent, Mr. Trump’s retreat on Wednesday on separating families at the border appeared to lessen the pressure on Congress to quickly pass a legislative fix. But the immigration votes were part of a long-running drama that can be traced back to a different action by Mr. Trump: his move last year to end an Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which had shielded the young immigrants known as Dreamers, who were brought illegally to the country as children. "
455,"At the beginning of “American Weather” — Chris Green’s lovely, but irritatingly oblique puppet theater piece at Here — a performer brings a metal ring to the center of the stage and sets it spinning. The arcs it traces is gripping, splendid, a geometer’s dream. Entropy being what it is, the hoop settles eventually. There’s not much that follows that has the impact of that circle. This circus might need more rings. There are seemingly two main characters in “American Weather”: a silent, isolated woman in a wooden chair and a puppet who appears projected on the curtain behind her. They never interact directly, though they are both accompanied by folk ballads delivered by Mr. Green and three musicians who double as stagehands and triple as bunraku-style puppeteers. There are also some hand-drawn animations and a microscopic examination of what is likely corrugated cardboard. It’s unclear what all this beauty is actually doing onstage. (When a show spends this much time focused on cardboard, one possible answer is: not much.) In an artist’s statement, Mr. Green identifies an initial interest in “the idea that we as Americans are each editing and contributing to this messy epic called America.” After the election, that preoccupation shifted into a more particular concern with Trump voters swayed by the prevailing political winds. A couple of lyrics nod toward this. As the woman sits in her chair, the chorus sings: “You change your mind / like the weather / It’s like you’ll do anything / for a change.” But otherwise, few of these ideas emerge in the piece, which I read as a meditation on loneliness and a need for community without ever really being convinced of that. If this is a work of political theater, it is abstract and unemotional in a time that seems anything but. The weather never really gets heavy. The videos of the puppet — an all-white figure who looks a little like an astronaut or a deep-sea diver — are some of the less involving moments. A faceless, voiceless doll can do only so much. But it provides an important contrast. The doll is being caressed by three or four hands at any given moment, but the woman is alone and untouched throughout. She has no one to help her until, in one of the piece’s most moving and definite sequences, she reaches out her hands and asks the spectators around her for help. Will she receive it? In audience participation we trust. "
456,"Mr. Trump is most likely referring to an estimate from an anti-immigration group that has been heavily criticized by other researchers for its methodological flaws. The group, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, estimated in 2017 that illegal immigration costs the United States $116 billion each year in spending on education, health care and law enforcement. The Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, found that the $116 billion estimate overcounted welfare benefits that undocumented immigrants receive, and undercounted the taxes that they pay. It said the $116 billion estimate would be more accurately accounted as ranging from $3.3 billion to $15.6 billion if those costs were considered. Additionally, the American Immigration Council studied an earlier but similar estimate by the Federation for American Immigration Reform. It concluded that education and health care account for more than half of the costs, and that the benefits were afforded to many American-citizen children of undocumented immigrants. PolitiFact, the fact-checking service, assessed several other studies. It found that the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s estimate “is largely based on broad estimates and assumptions” while others have been significantly lower or inconclusive. Last month, Mr. Trump oversold the impact of a new law called Right to Try, which allowed patients to seek access to drugs not yet fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration. He has since falsely asserted that patients could not obtain experimental medicine before the law at all. "
457,"Wildly ambitious, thoroughly entertaining and embellished with some snaky moves, Eugene Jarecki’s documentary “The King” is a lot like its nominal subject, Elvis Presley. In part, it tells the familiar story of the poor little boy who became a king. But Mr. Jarecki has a second, larger and more complicated story he wants to address, too: that of the United States. Tying one man’s body to the body politic, he seeks to turn Presley’s life — from ravishing, thrilling youth to ravaging, putrefying fame — into the story of the country, an arc that takes the documentary from Graceland to Trumpland. Why Elvis? For Mr. Jarecki, the answer seems to be, why not? Mostly, though, there is the 1963 Rolls-Royce Phantom V, which came into Mr. Jarecki’s sights a few years back and serves as both the documentary’s roving stage and silent co-star. It’s a silver beast: huge, cumbersome-looking and temperamental. (It breaks down.) Rigged with cameras, it has to be among the more expensive picture cars in the history of cinema, having been bought by the movie’s production company in 2014 for almost $400,000. Mr. Jarecki, who is regularly seen and heard throughout the movie, never goes into how he got behind the wheel of this pricey collector’s item (now resold), which is too bad because it provokes your curiosity. (I had to ask the publicist.) He just invites you to hop in while he steers you cross-country, following ribbons of road and a time line that shifts from the past to the present and back again. The details of some of that history are as familiar as a fairy tale, like the shotgun shack in Tupelo, Miss., where Presley was born on Jan. 8, 1935. He was the only surviving child of his beloved mother, Gladys, and his father, Vernon, who three years later was in prison for check forgery, just one of the many milestones that Mr. Jarecki passes as he quickly begins complicating his story. Working with a team of editors, he introduces Presley, the man and the myth, using an onslaught of archival images and sounds. In interviews and in early television appearances (hello, Ed Sullivan), the young Elvis rises to a mesmerizing, cacophonous chorus: “We want Elvis, we want Elvis!” Mr. Jarecki complies, delivering Presley with the help of a large group of revolving guests that includes James Carville, who soon after slipping into the Rolls invokes Mike Tyson, another fallen god. Mr. Jarecki likes to visually embroider the dialogue, and as Mr. Carville speaks, the movie cuts to Mr. Tyson delivering a devastating blow in the ring. “Mike Tyson,” Mr. Carville says, “hit you so hard he changes the way you taste.” Then it’s back to Mr. Carville opining on Elvis in the Rolls: “America never tasted the same after he hit.” "
458,"To the Editor: Re “In Retreat, Trump Halts Separating Migrant Families” (front page, June 21): Signing an executive order ending the policy of removing children from illegal migrants crossing the border should not and cannot be seen as a victory for President Trump. For God’s sake, he started the fire and now he wants to be celebrated for putting it out. Enough already. PAT NEWMAN
STAFFORD SPRINGS, CONN. To the Editor: As President Trump signed the executive order on Wednesday, he remarked, “I didn’t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated.” Translation: “I didn’t like the sight or the feeling of the onslaught of wall-to-wall negative coverage I received, so I decided to act.” JOHN R. ARBITELL JR.
MALVERN, PA. To the Editor: I am very sympathetic to the plight of children being separated from their parents. What I am not sympathetic to is the use of children as instruments for getting into our country illegally. Some of these children may not even be the individual’s sons or daughters. They are being used as pawns by undocumented individuals to cross the border. I was an immigrant myself in 1949 as a Holocaust survivor, and my parents had to apply for a visa and provide two American sponsors to show we weren’t going to be a burden to this country. The vetting process took three years, but they followed protocol until we were approved. Families who want to enter our country should go through the same appropriate channels, showing appropriate documentation for themselves and their children. ERICA LINDEN-FINEBERG
NEW YORK To the Editor: This month alone, my family and I bade farewell to Aziz, Bahiaa, Carlos, Esteban, Sergio and Miguel, men and women who had entered America with nothing more than the hope of a brighter future. Each worked — hard — in the United States for more than a decade (we employed several of them). Each passionately pursued citizenship. And each was rebuffed at every turn by a system that is Orwellian, and a political atmosphere that is toxic. Simply put, they gave up on America. We are but one New Jersey family. Do the math. How many good, hard-working people are “fleeing back” to their countries with the story of an America that doesn’t care? Our hearts are not only broken. They are enraged. PHILIP TAFT, HOPEWELL, N.J. To the Editor: “Incivility Infests Life in the U.S. on Trump’s Cue” (White House Memo, front page, June 21) mentions some objections to comparing the current separation of children of the seekers of asylum to the separation of children during the Holocaust. As a Holocaust survivor who lost his whole family, I do not consider the gradation of evil appropriate. Once the threshold of civility has been breached, the evil that results should be condemned, not ranked. MICHAEL KATZ, NEW YORK "
459,President Donald Trump signed an executive order intended to end the separation of families at the border by detaining parents and children together. It is not clear when detained children will be reunited with their parents. 
460,"The speed of America’s moral descent under Donald Trump is breathtaking. In a matter of months we’ve gone from a nation that stood for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness to a nation that tears children from their parents and puts them in cages. What’s almost equally remarkable about this plunge into barbarism is that it’s not a response to any actual problem. The mass influx of murderers and rapists that Trump talks about, the wave of crime committed by immigrants here (and, in his mind, refugees in Germany), are things that simply aren’t happening. They’re just sick fantasies being used to justify real atrocities. And you know what this reminds me of? The history of anti-Semitism, a tale of prejudice fueled by myths and hoaxes that ended in genocide. First, let’s talk about modern U.S. immigration and how it compares to those sick fantasies. There is a highly technical debate among economists about whether low-education immigrants exert a depressing effect on the wages of low-education native-born workers (most researchers find that they don’t, but there is some disagreement). This debate, however, is playing no role in Trump policies. What these policies reflect, instead, is a vision of “American carnage,” of big cities overrun by violent immigrants. And this vision bears no relationship to reality. For one thing, despite a small uptick since 2014, violent crime in America is actually at historical lows, with the homicide rate back to where it was in the early 1960s. (German crime is also at a historical low, by the way.) Trump’s carnage is a figment of his imagination. "
461,"WASHINGTON — President Trump appeared to take his battle with the news media to a new level on Thursday, apparently using the first lady’s much-covered visit with detained immigrant children in a Texas border town as an opportunity to spell out his grievances with the press. As the temperature climbed to 80 degrees on Thursday at Joint Base Andrews near Washington, Melania Trump boarded her plane wearing an olive green coat that read, in white capital letters, “I really don’t care. Do U?” Mrs. Trump did not wear it while visiting with the children, but she did wear it upon her return to the capital, in full view of the news photographers who had gathered to capture her arrival. As the images were beamed around the world, the message was also in full view of her husband, a vociferous viewer of cable news. “I REALLY DON’T CARE, DO U?” written on the back of Melania’s jacket, refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!” he wrote on Twitter. The first lady’s office did not back up the president’s explanation. Mrs. Trump’s spokeswoman said it was “just a jacket” — nothing to see here. [Read our fashion critic’s reaction to Melania Trump’s coat.] For the second time since her husband took office — and the second time on a trip to Texas — Mrs. Trump had made an unusual choice. It was a move reminiscent of her decision last year to wear stilettos to a hurricane relief zone, which was also the subject of much deliberation about her fashion decisions. "
462,"The nation’s biggest banks are strong enough to continue lending if the economy plunges into a severe downturn, an assessment by the Federal Reserve on Thursday that could fuel Wall Street’s calls to further relax financial regulations. The results of the first phase of the Fed’s annual “stress tests” showed that the country’s banks have more than enough capital to survive the combination of a recession, cratering of housing prices and double-digit unemployment. The banks are riding high thanks to tax cuts and recent moves to soften regulations. They are eager to return more of their profits to shareholders, and the test results suggest regulators will give many the green light to pay dividends or buy their own shares next week. Still, two Wall Street giants — Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — came close to falling short on one of the Fed’s financial-health gauges. That could complicate their plans to pay dividends and repurchase their shares. The ability of most banks to ace the tests is an indication of how far Wall Street has come since the financial crisis. A decade ago, bad bets on the housing market crippled the industry and led the government to bail out hundreds of banks. To prevent a repeat of those taxpayer-financed rescues, the Fed now requires banks to maintain capital cushions that would allow them not only to stay afloat but also to keep lending during periods of intense financial stress. Since 2009, the 35 banks that underwent the tests have added about $800 billion in the highest quality type of capital, the Fed said. "
463,"“I REALLY DON’T CARE, DO U?” When the first lady, Melania Trump, on an unannounced humanitarian visit to a children’s shelter in Texas, strode onto her airplane in an olive green Zara army jacket with those words scrawled in faux white graffiti on the back, it sent the watching world into what might be called, with some understatement, a meltdown. “Insensitive,” “heartless” and “unthinking” were some of the words hurled through the digisphere about the choice. “It’s a jacket,” her communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement to reporters. “There was no hidden message.” She’s right, of course. It wasn’t hidden. It was literally written on the first lady’s back. The question is: Who was the intended audience? The assumption implicit in the outrage is that the message was meant for those Mrs. Trump was meeting. But here’s the thing: The first lady has had some experience with the attention paid when she boards planes. "

A day after reversing his hard-line position of separating immigrant children from their families, President Trump took to Twitter with demands: Change the laws, build a wall, and do not hire immigration judges. An American official told us that the Department of Health and Human Services asked the Pentagon to make preparations to house thousands of migrant children on military bases.

466,"I was a student at the University of Washington in Seattle when I arrived in Washington, D.C., to work as an intern in 1983. I was in search of an intellectual role model. I soon found one in Charles Krauthammer, who was writing for The New Republic and Time. In 1985, he became a columnist for The Washington Post. Years later, he became a close friend and eventually — he would wince at this — something of a heroic figure to me. His character turned out to be even more impressive than his mind. On June 8, Charles announced that his doctors had informed him that he had only a few weeks to live, the result of an aggressive, rapidly spreading cancer. “This is the final verdict,” he wrote in a note to his readers. “My fight is over.” He died on Thursday. It is a shattering loss. Charles, who received the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for commentary, was not only an elegant writer; he also had a beautiful mind: precise, logical, subtle and blessedly free of cant. He loathed trendiness and the fads that sometimes sweep over the culture. Like any good columnist, Charles had deep convictions — on the uniqueness and greatness of America, his devotion to democratic pluralism, and his support for Israel and Zionism; on the wonder and joys of physics, chess and baseball, especially his beloved Washington Nationals. (We once exchanged thoughts on an upcoming Super Bowl, but he couldn’t help concluding this way: “Of course, the whole damn game is just a prelude to the beginning of spring training. We must keep things in perspective.”) But convictions on some matters never meant certainty on all matters. He was comfortable with what he called “inescapable ambiguity” on complicated moral matters. For Charles, abortion was such an issue. My views on abortion are more conservative than his were, but I have long kept in mind what he wrote in 1985: This is a model of concision, precision and illumination. In an age when political commentary is getting shallower and more vituperative, we will especially miss Charles’s style of writing — calm, carefully constructed arguments based on propositions and evidence, tinged with a cutting wit and wry humor but never malice. There’s another quality of his that we will miss: intellectual independence. Charles started out his political career as a centrist Democrat yet ended up as a conservative and a fixture on Fox News. But he situated himself in a particular school within conservatism, one that is temperamentally moderate, deeply suspicious of ideology, aware of the complexity of human society, and empirical in the sense that he was constantly testing what he was saying against what was actually happening in the world and the effect it had. Charles had no interest in being a member of a political team; his goal was to better understand reality. "
467,"For Suraj Patel, running for Congress against an entrenched incumbent has led to some awkward and unexpected moments. Elected officials have asked him to delete their pictures from his campaign’s Facebook page. When he has tried to set up meetings with key New York City leaders, some refused — simply because they do not dare to be seen with him in public. Many did not answer at all. “You’ll never eat lunch in this town again if you challenge Carolyn Maloney,” Mr. Patel recalled one political consultant warning about his race against a 13-term Democrat. For Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, challenging Representative Joseph Crowley has meant watching local Democratic officials bolt the other way from her at parades, wary of appearing too close to her. Some have agreed to meetings, but behind closed doors — no cellphones allowed. Mr. Patel, 34, and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 28, are among a group of energetic Democratic insurgents across the country, many of them young or female or people of color, who are seeking to knock off some of Congress’s most tenured Democrats. They have not succeeded so far: No congressional Democrat in America has lost a primary in 2018. The establishment’s winning streak will be tested again on Tuesday in New York City, where primary contests feature four Democratic challengers in one of the densest concentrations of intraparty battles in the nation. "
468,"Charles Krauthammer, a former psychiatrist and self-described Great Society Democrat who metamorphosed into one of the nation’s most cogent conservative voices as a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist and television commentator, died on Thursday at a hospital in Atlanta. He was 68. The Washington Post, where his weekly column had appeared since 1985, reported the death, quoting his son, Daniel, who said the cause was cancer of the small intestine. Mr. Krauthammer lived in the Washington area. On June 8, explaining what he called his 10-month “uncharacteristic silence,” Mr. Krauthammer revealed in The Post that despite surgery for a stomach tumor last August, cancer had recurred, and that he had only weeks to live. “This is the final verdict,” he wrote. “My fight is over.” While Mr. Krauthammer extolled Ronald Reagan (he ranked him No. 2 among 20th-century presidents, behind Franklin D. Roosevelt) and belittled Barack Obama’s record, he could criticize his fellow neoconservatives and Republicans just as fiercely as he skewered liberal Democrats. Aligning himself with most conservatives, he was gung-ho about going to war with Iraq in 2003, arguing for replacing Saddam Hussein with a democratic government, and he expressed few compunctions about torturing suspected terrorists. But he also took a more liberal line in favoring the continued legalization of abortion, looser restrictions on stem cell research, abolition of the death penalty and, as an avowed Zionist, a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. "
469,"WASHINGTON — Behind the White House’s plan to punish China with tariffs and other restrictions is a growing concern that Beijing is using industrial policy to dominate industries of the future, at the expense of the United States and other nations. On Thursday, the Trump administration laid out its case in a 35-page report entitled “How China’s Economic Aggression Threatens the Technologies and Intellectual Property of the United States and the World.” It exhaustively details the steps Chinese officials take to protect and promote their domestic industries and disadvantage foreign competitors, including the use of government subsidies, cyberespionage and forced intellectual property transfers to Chinese companies from American and other foreign firms. The United States is trying to derail China’s dominance by punishing Beijing. But it has yet to detail how it plans to build America’s dominance in industries that will power economic and job growth in the future, or cultivate what the administration officials call the “crown jewels of American technology and intellectual property.” Speaking with reporters on Tuesday, a senior administration official said Mr. Trump’s tariffs are designed to benefit American high-tech industries from the sort of “predation” China has used in the past. Many economists say those steps are insufficient — and possibly counterproductive — to position American companies to compete in emerging, high-tech, globalized industries. They say the administration needs a proactive strategy to bolster American innovation and technology. That includes investing in federal research and development spending, worker skills and attracting more high-caliber foreign students to American graduate programs and fostering advanced industries such as biodefense and artificial intelligence. Whether industries like semiconductors thrive going forward in the United States “will depend not on America’s success in curbing China’s progress, but rather on its ability to sustain and support innovation by U.S. companies,” Laura D’Andrea Tyson, a former top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton, wrote this week. "
470,"ACTOPAN, Mexico — In this arid farming town in central Mexico, a crowd packed the plaza under a punishing sun to hear the leftist presidential hopeful Andrés Manuel López Obrador promise to end the corruption that plagues the nation. “They have even said that corruption is part of Mexican culture,” he said to a chorus of supportive shouts. “That is a falsehood. A big lie. In our people, there is a great reserve of values, cultural, moral, spiritual, in the families, in the pueblos, in the communities.” He pointed upward. “The problem is above. The rulers always set a bad example.” Mr. López Obrador went on to promise cuts in government expenditures, including a reduction in the president’s salary and the selling of the executive air fleet. He said he would redirect money to the poor through pensions, scholarships, apprenticeships and free fertilizer for small farmers, a vow greeted with raucous cheers. His message — that he will overturn what he calls “the mafia of power” and replace it with an austere bureaucracy that invests in communities — is proving appealing as the July 1 election nears. According to the Bloomberg Poll tracker, Mr. López Obrador has the support of over 50 percent of voters, twice that of his rival Ricardo Anaya, of the center-right National Action Party. If these numbers translate to votes, it will give Mr. López Obrador, 64, the most decisive victory in a Mexican presidential election since 1982. The colossal lead comes as a surprise, considering that in his previous two bids for president, in 2006 and 2012, Mr. López Obrador won no more than 35 percent of the vote. His message has changed little over the years — some of the phrases I hear at his rallies are almost identical to ones that I wrote down when I covered his speeches 12 years ago. What has changed are his expressions: He looks happier, more relaxed, less angry. Back in the 2000s, leftist politicians were sweeping Latin America. Now, conservative-leaning leaders have made a comeback in countries like Argentina and Peru. Mr. López Obrador appears to be bucking the trend. "
471,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. More twists on children detained at the U.S. border, World Cup spirit in Siberia and New Zealand’s new first daughter. Here’s what you need to know: • Back to tough talk on immigration. A day after President Trump reversed his hard-line position of separating immigrant children from their families, the U.S. asked the Pentagon to prepare housing for as many as 20,000 unaccompanied migrant children on American military bases. Mr. Trump had taken to Twitter Thursday morning with demands: Change the laws, build a wall, and do not hire immigration judges. Melania Trump went to Texas to visit one of the facilities where some of the separated children are being held, raising eyebrows by boarding her plane in Washington in an olive green coat with writing in white capital letters that read “I really don’t care. Do U?” And a new focus has emerged on the youngest detainees. More than 2,400 children under the age of 12 — many of whom are toddlers and infants — are believed to be in federal custody. Many are in special “tender age” shelters. _____ "
472,"I prefer the window seat. I like to idle away time on flights trying to guess where and what I’m flying over, without the benefit of the map. I’m hypnotized by the red-beige-brown carpet of California desert; mesmerized by the unbroken wilderness of northern Maine; awed by the peaks and valleys of the Cascades; calmed by the serenity of the Great Lakes. And I draw a political conclusion: America is vast, largely empty and often lonely. Roughly 80 percent of Americans live in urban areas, covering just 3 percent of the overall landmass. We have a population density of 35 people per square kilometer — as opposed to 212 for Switzerland and 271 for the U.K. We could use some more people. Make that a lot more. That’s a point worth bearing in mind in the larger immigration debate unfolding in Congress. The Trump administration’s policy of forcibly separating migrant Latin American children from their parents was a moral outrage that, had it not been belatedly terminated on Wednesday, would have taken its place in the annals of American ignominy. It was also a moral outrage that concealed a political folly. As of this writing, House Republicans are flailing in their efforts to pass a comprehensive immigration bill. That’s just as well since, as the Cato Institute’s David Bier points out, even the more moderate of the two G.O.P. bills would have cut overall legal immigration. But that means we still need real immigration reform, and not simply as an act of decency toward so-called Dreamers brought to this country as children by their undocumented parents. America’s immigration crisis right now is that we don’t have enough immigrants. "
473,"The American oil and gas industry is leaking more methane than the government thinks — much more, a new study says. Since methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, that is bad news for climate change. The new study, published Thursday in the journal Science, puts the rate of methane emissions from domestic oil and gas operations at 2.3 percent of total production per year, which is 60 percent higher than the current estimate from the Environmental Protection Agency. That might seem like a small fraction of the total, but it represents an estimated 13 million metric tons lost each year, or enough natural gas to fuel 10 million homes. Thanks to a boom in hydraulic fracturing in states like Texas and Pennsylvania, natural gas has quickly replaced coal as the leading fuel used by America’s power plants. It has also helped, to some extent, in the fight against climate change: When burned for electricity, natural gas produces about half the carbon dioxide that coal does. The shift from coal to gas has helped lower CO₂ emissions from America’s power plants by 27 percent since 2005. But methane, the main component of natural gas, can warm the planet more than 80 times as much as the same amount of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period if it escapes into the atmosphere before being burned. A recent study found that natural gas power plants could actually be worse for climate change than coal plants if their leakage rate rose above 4 percent. Neither the E.P.A.’s estimates of leakage rates nor the higher estimates in the new study suggest that gas has crossed that threshold. Still, experts said that curbing methane emissions from oil and gas operations could prove an important climate policy. If there is good news in the report, it is that much of the leakage is fixable at relatively low cost. The lost methane is worth an estimated $2 billion a year. "
474,"WASHINGTON — President Trump hopes to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in the next few weeks even as the American leader increasingly clashes with European allies over how to counter Moscow’s assertive actions in Europe and the Middle East. Mr. Trump is sending his national security adviser, John R. Bolton, to Moscow next week to discuss a possible meeting. Mr. Trump is already scheduled to attend a NATO summit meeting in Brussels next month, followed by a long-delayed visit to Britain. He could presumably add a stop in another country like Austria to see Mr. Putin. Mr. Trump has been eager to get together with Mr. Putin for months despite increasing tension in the relationship between Russia and the West. Just two weeks ago, Mr. Trump urged the rest of the Group of 7 major industrial powers to readmit Russia, which was expelled in 2014 after its armed seizure of Crimea from Ukraine. But the other members rejected the idea, deeming it inappropriate. By meeting with Mr. Putin on his own anyway, Mr. Trump would send a signal to European leaders that he does not intend to be held hostage to their approach to Moscow, adding another rupture to his fights with the United States’ traditional allies over tariffs, security and migration. In recent public comments, he has emphasized the importance of building a friendly relationship with Mr. Putin and minimized the continuing dispute over Ukraine, blaming Russia’s actions on former President Barack Obama. “The problem is that Trump is unilaterally dismantling much of the trans-Atlantic effort that was set up to constrain Russian adventurism following the beginning of the war in Ukraine in 2014,” said Andrew S. Weiss, a vice president at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who served as President Bill Clinton’s Russia adviser. “With the U.S.-German relationship in tatters, Putin is essentially being given a free hand.” Mr. Trump has been seeking a meeting with Mr. Putin since March, when he called the Russian president to congratulate him on winning another term in an election widely viewed in the West as a sham. During their conversation, Mr. Trump broached the idea of a White House visit by Mr. Putin, who has not been there since 2005. "
475,"WASHINGTON — The United States is preparing to shelter as many as 20,000 migrant children on four American military bases, a Pentagon spokesman said on Thursday, as federal officials struggled to carry out President Trump’s order to keep immigrant families together after they are apprehended at the border. The 20,000 beds at bases in Texas and Arkansas would house “unaccompanied alien children,” said a Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Michael Andrews, although other federal agencies provided conflicting explanations about how the shelters would be used and who would be housed there. There were reports of widespread confusion on the border. It was unclear whether the military housing would also house the parents of children in migrant families that have been detained, and officials at the White House, the Defense Department and the Department of Health and Human Services said on Thursday that they could not provide details. The Pentagon announcement followed Mr. Trump’s executive order on Wednesday to keep families together after they illegally cross the Mexican border into the United States. The order called for detaining families at the same location. Democrats questioned the 20,000-bed plan. “Is it even feasible?” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, asked from the Senate floor. Advocates for the migrants expressed concern about the prospect of vast settlements of families housed on military bases. "
476,"NEW HAVEN — A few months ago, when Rachel Roberts, a 44-year-old owner of yoga studios in Newport, Ky., decided to run for State Senate as a Democrat, her newly hired campaign manager sent her a packet of photographs of successful women and suggested she pick one and model her campaign look accordingly “There was Nancy Pelosi and Sheryl Sandberg,” Ms. Roberts remembered, rolling her eyes. The problem: “That’s not who I am. I spent the last seven years in Lululemon.” At a time of smartphones and instant imagery, when unprecedented numbers of women are running for office and often placing their gender at the center of their campaigns, it is impossible to ignore the role image can play in positioning. After all, if you are going to be the change, don’t you have to look the change? Last week 80 women, including Ms. Roberts, came to Yale University here to attend the 2018 Women’s Campaign School and, among other things, try to answer that question. An intensive five-day course, hosted though not administered by the Yale Law School, it helps prepare women to run for office, get ready to help others run for office and establish political networks.

477,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. President Trump’s U-turn, Britain’s security shift and Hungary’s anti-immigrant laws. Here’s the latest: • “We’ve got to be keeping families together.” In an abrupt reversal, President Trump signed an executive order to end the separation of migrant families at the U.S. border. Instead, parents and children are to be detained together, indefinitely. But more than 2,300 children will not be immediately reunited with their parents, an administration official said. Mr. Trump is seeking to contain a full-blown political crisis over the separations. The backlash is fierce: His policy’s most vocal defender, Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of Homeland Security, was confronted at dinner by chanting protesters. Before Mr. Trump’s about-face, Pope Francis said he agreed with American bishops, who have called the separation policy “immoral” and “contrary to Catholic values.” Meanwhile, the U.S. is moving more rapidly toward a future in which whites are no longer a majority, a new study found. _____ "
478,"WASHINGTON — As federal prosecutors face skyrocketing immigration caseloads along the southwestern border, the Defense Department agreed Wednesday to help the Justice Department prosecute the cases. Twenty-one lawyers for the Defense Department “will work full time, assisting in prosecuting reactive border immigration cases, with a focus on misdemeanor improper entry and felony illegal re-entry cases,” the department said in a statement. The assignment is to last for about six months. The Justice Department had asked for the help in anticipation of a surge in cases after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a “zero tolerance” policy in April. “A crisis has erupted at our southwest border that necessitates an escalated effort to prosecute those who choose to illegally cross our border,” Mr. Sessions said at the time. “To those who wish to challenge the Trump administration’s commitment to public safety, national security and the rule of law, I warn you: Illegally entering this country will not be rewarded, but will instead be met with the full prosecutorial powers of the Department of Justice,” he said. In a memo to federal prosecutors along the border with Mexico, Mr. Sessions said they should request additional resources as needed to enforce the new policy. “Our goal is not simply more cases. It is to end the illegality in our immigration system,” he said. The Justice Department’s hard line on immigration has elicited strong opposition in recent weeks. Immigration judges fear that the attorney general wants to prioritize speed over due process for immigration and amnesty cases. Protests against a decision to enforce separation of children from parents who seek to enter the United States reached such a fevered pitch that President Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday meant to end the practice. Yet criminal prosecutions for illegally crossing the southwestern border jumped to 8,298 in April, the month Mr. Sessions announced the zero-tolerance policy, an increase of 30 percent from March, according to data from TRAC, a research institute at Syracuse University. Curbing immigration has been a signature issue for Mr. Sessions throughout his career, which has included stints as a federal prosecutor and state attorney general in Alabama, and nearly 20 years in the Senate. In speeches this year, Mr. Sessions has said that the zero-tolerance policy would hopefully deter immigrants from entering the United States. “The world will know what our rules are, and great numbers will no longer undertake this dangerous journey,” he said in a speech this month to immigration judges. “The number of illegal aliens and the number of baseless claims will fall,” he said. “A virtuous cycle will be created, rather than a vicious cycle of expanding illegality.” "
479,"Immigration activists shuttled from terminal to terminal at La Guardia Airport in New York late Wednesday night, after news spread on social media that children who had been separated from their parents at the United States-Mexico border might be arriving on flights. Hours earlier, President Trump had signed an executive order saying that the policy of separating immigrant children and parents would stop, but in New York hundreds of children had already arrived to be placed in shelters or foster care. The protesters held signs at security gates that read “Bienvenidos a New York,” and “Te amamos.” And they sang protest songs like “We Shall Overcome,” in English and Spanish, that reverberated through the otherwise largely empty airport. Groups like Make the Road New York, an immigrant activist group, posted calls to action on Twitter, and as the night continued, the numbers swelled. Outside Terminal B — not long after a group of seven boys was spotted getting off American Airlines Flight 2716, wearing dark hoodies and carrying government-labeled belongings — a circle of about 200 protesters gathered along the taxi line to plan for how they might lend support to other children getting off planes, though there was no way to determine immediately which might have been separated from their parents.

481,"THE END OF THE FRENCH INTELLECTUAL
From Zola to Houellebecq
By Shlomo Sand
Translated by David Fernbach
278 pp. Verso. $29.95. Shlomo Sand explains that, when he was growing up in Israel, he read a novel by Simone de Beauvoir, who conjured for him the ideal of the lofty intellectual in its loftiest version, which is Parisian. He took Beauvoir herself to be the noblest possible exemplar of Parisian loftiness, together with her comrades Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. And he dreamed of the day when he, too, would unsheathe his mighty pen to do battle in the name of universal principle against the forces of injustice and ignorant prejudice. But then, having advanced to what sounds like a later stage of adolescence, he discovered that he had been naïve, and Beauvoir and Sartre had played less than heroic roles during the German Occupation of France. Wartime cowardice made them feel guilty about the Jews, and guilt led them in later years to overcompensate by offering too much sympathy to Israel, which was appalling. And Camus turned out to be just as bad. It was not just that, during the Algerian War, Camus declined to endorse the terrorism of the independence fighters. He, too, displayed a dismaying sympathy for Israel. And, as Sand explains in the opening pages of “The End of the French Intellectual,” the scales fell from his eyes. Sand’s readers will recognize that scales falling from his eyes is the dominant theme of his oeuvre. In the best-known of his books, “The Invention of the Jewish People,” he discovered that the Jews are not the Jews — or, at any rate, are not the descendants of their own ancestors that Jews have spent thousands of years supposing themselves to be. He discovered that, over the millenniums, Jewish communities have come into existence with no connection to the ancient Hebrews — e.g., the little-known Khazars of Central Asia, who converted to Judaism, or the Jewish Berbers of North Africa, who were led by a fabulous queen. He discovered that Jewish historians are unreliable on these questions because they have drawn their inspiration from the volkisch and racist traditions of Germany. He discovered that, even if the Jews do constitute a nation, which they do not, a Jewish state would be, by definition, an outrage against civilized political thought — as explained in still another of his books, “The Invention of the Land of Israel.” And then, having disabused himself of every possible modern Jewish belief about the Jews, still more scales dropped from his eyes, and he composed a book called “How I Stopped Being a Jew.” It is hard to know who is more colorful, the Jewish Berber queen or Shlomo Sand, the Israeli professor. In “The End of the French Intellectual,” he strings together a set of personal reflections, historical annotations and topical commentaries on the ideal of the lofty intellectual, in the course of which he finds 10 ways to say, with suitable references to master thinkers across the centuries, that intellectuals ought to uphold universal principles. And, at the same time, they ought to be honest about any biases or circumstances that might influence their thinking. He contemplates the right-wing writers of France in the 1930s, with passing notation, for some reason, of whoever among them, a few, might have had Jewish roots. He contemplates the sociology of intellectuals. He proposes a Marxist interpretation, with invocations of Karl Kautsky and Antonio Gramsci, according to which the intellectual ideal in its Parisian version rose and fell in tandem with the workers’ movement, from the late 19th century to the late 20th. And then, having polished off these desultory points, he inquires into the intellectual scene in our own time, now that the “great Parisian luminaries” are gone — the scene in Paris, that is. "
482,"HARLINGEN, Tex. — The business of housing, transporting and watching over migrant children detained along the southwest border is not a multimillion-dollar business. It’s a billion-dollar one. The nonprofit Southwest Key Programs has won at least $955 million in federal contracts since 2015 to run shelters and provide other services to immigrant children in federal custody. Its shelter for migrant boys at a former Walmart Supercenter in South Texas has been the focus of nationwide scrutiny, but Southwest Key is but one player in the lucrative, secretive world of the migrant-shelter business. About a dozen contractors operate more than 30 facilities in Texas alone, with numerous others contracted for about 100 shelters in 16 other states. If there is a migrant-shelter hub in America, then it is perhaps in the four-county Rio Grande Valley region of South Texas, where about a dozen shelters occupy former stores, schools and medical centers. They are some of the region’s biggest employers, though what happens inside is often highly confidential: One group has employees sign nondisclosure agreements, more a fixture of the high-stakes corporate world than of nonprofit child-care centers. The recent separation of some 2,300 migrant children from their families under the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy on illegal border crossers has thrust this invisible industry into the spotlight in recent weeks, as images of toddlers and teenagers taken from their parents and detained behind locked doors have set off a political firestorm. President Trump’s order on Wednesday calling for migrant families to be detained together likely means millions more in contracts for private shelter operators, construction companies and defense contractors. A small network of private prison companies already is operating family detention centers in Texas and Pennsylvania, and those facilities are likely to expand under the new presidential directive, should it stand up to legal review, analysts said. The range of contractors working in the migrant-shelter industry varies widely. BCFS, a global network of nonprofit groups, has received at least $179 million in federal contracts since 2015 under the government’s so-called unaccompanied alien children program, designed to handle migrant youths who arrive in the country without a parent or other family member. Many of the contractors, some of which are religiously affiliated organizations and emergency-management agencies such as Catholic Charities, see their work as humanitarian aid to some of the most vulnerable children in the world. "
483,"On Sunday, more than 40,000 people are expected to march through the streets of New York City for the Pride parade. That’s equivalent to every single resident of Ithaca, N.Y., plus 10,000 friends. Several hundred thousand more are expected to stand cheering on the sidelines, while a small — but not insignificant — group of L.G.B.T.Q. New Yorkers are expected to stay home and maybe take a nap. Or maybe they’ll head off to the beach. They will be participating in the time-honored L.G.B.T.Q. tradition of never quite making it there. (This tradition is sometimes accompanied by a comment about the individual’s discomfort with crowds or a criticism of the “corporate vibe.”) I tried to explain this the other day to Bailey McDaniel, 22, a woman who had spent more than a year battling to bring Pride to her town, Starkville, Miss. She thought I was joking. Our conversation went roughly like this: Bud Light and Target really sponsor Pride in New York City? Yes, they do. There are queer people who resent this? Yes. "
484,"SAN ANTONIO — Senator Ted Cruz had an idea: legislation to keep immigrant families together at the border — stanching a political crisis created by President Trump — while also adding judges to speed up asylum requests. Mr. Trump had a different impulse: make Mr. Cruz’s life exceedingly complicated. This was not a first. “We have to have a real border, not judges,” Mr. Trump said in a speech on Tuesday, mocking the proposal one day before issuing an executive order to end the separations. “What country does this?” Over the last three years of a many-chaptered political life, some things have changed for Mr. Cruz — Mr. Trump, in the Texas senator’s estimation, has gone from “terrific” to “pathological liar” to pretty O.K. after all — and some things have stayed the same. The main constant: the president disrupting his best laid plans. After conceding defeat to Mr. Trump in a vicious 2016 presidential primary, Mr. Cruz, 47, is now facing career mortality in a re-election fight back home, even as he takes care to keep a foothold in the national conversation. He is one of several ambitious conservatives, and perhaps the most ambitious and most conservative, feeling his way through a Republican metamorphosis under Mr. Trump that a colleague, Senator Bob Corker, recently compared to cultish behavior.

485,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Days after saying “you can’t do it through an executive order,” President Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday meant to end the separation of immigrant families who are detained at the border. But there are still legal and practical obstacles to ending the practice, and the fate of the more than 2,300 children already separated from their parents is unclear. Here’s what Mr. Trump’s order does and does not do, and how immigrant detention policies have evolved since the Obama administration. Hundreds of migrant children have been sent to New York City, but Mayor Bill de Blasio said the federal government had refused to tell city officials where they were being housed. At a rally in Minnesota on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump vowed to be “just as tough” on immigration as before: “They’re not sending their finest. We’re sending them the hell back.” • In border states, Republicans say that whatever sympathy they feel for divided families is complicated by frustration over the flow of undocumented immigrants. "
486,"BERLIN — In Germany, the dividing line between books and plays is astonishingly fluid. Most English-speaking visitors here would probably be surprised to see names like Thomas Mann and Dostoyevsky adorning theater marquees. Perhaps the phenomenon can be traced back to Goethe, whose two-part “Faust” — a central text of German literature — is an “armchair drama,” meant to be read rather than staged. (Goethe didn’t think the latter was possible; a production of the complete epic in 2000 lasted 21 hours.) Goethe aside, directors here love finding ways to bring books to the theater. In a recent trend, international literary best-sellers have been appearing onstage with considerable speed. In Berlin, Hamburg and Munich, there have been versions of Michel Houellebecq’s controversial novel “Submission,” Miranda July’s “The First Bad Man” and Kamel Daoud’s “The Mersault Investigation,” among others. (The Hamburg production of “Submission” began touring Germany a mere year after the book’s publication.) Now the Berlin Schaubühne has brought Édouard Louis’s “History of Violence” to vivid, shocking life. This autobiographical novel caused a stir when it was published in France in 2016, and was released in the United States this week. “History of Violence” is a personal examination of class and sexuality that is also the story of an assault, rape and attempted murder. In the course of the novel, the narrator’s effort to reconstruct his traumatic memories becomes an indictment of an intolerant society. Walking home at 4 a.m. after Christmas dinner, a young man named Édouard lets himself be picked up by a handsome stranger of Algerian origin. The initial tenderness of the encounter evaporates later that morning, however, when the stranger robs Louis and then rapes him at gunpoint. At the police station, at the hospital and, later, talking to his sister, Édouard tries to process the nightmarish incident. Time and again, people’s prejudices about both gay men and Arabs stand in the way of genuine interest in his story or concern for his well-being. Thomas Ostermeier, the Schaubühne’s ingenious artistic director, adapted the book along with the author and Florian Borschmeyer. One of the producers is St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn, which earlier this year presented Mr. Ostermeier’s Schaubühne production of “Returning to Reims,” based on the memoir by Didier Eribon (a sociologist who is one of Mr. Louis’ foremost influences).

488,"Any day now, perhaps as soon as Thursday, the Supreme Court will issue a decision that more than any other case this term will reveal to us the heart and soul of the Roberts Court at the end of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.’s 14th year. The case is Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. It presents the question of whether the court will adhere to its 41-year-old precedent under which states can require public employees who object to joining a union to nonetheless pay their fair share of the union’s costs of the collective bargaining from which all employees benefit. I’ve just made a bold claim for a case that’s not at the top of most people’s Supreme Court watch lists. What about Trump v. Hawaii, the case on the validity of the president’s Muslim travel ban, also due for a decision in the coming days? That case is extremely important, of course, but here’s the difference: There was no way the court was going to avoid a case presenting fundamental questions of presidential authority. But Janus is a case, it’s fair to say, of the Supreme Court’s own creation. It arrived on the court’s docket a year ago at the court’s implicit invitation after three previous efforts by conservative justices to find a vehicle for overturning the old precedent had foundered. The leader of this effort, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., almost struck gold in January 2016 when the chief justice assigned him to write the opinion for a 5-to-4 majority in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association. But then Justice Antonin Scalia died, leaving the court divided 4 to 4 and Justice Alito a vote short of his goal. Two months later, the Janus petition arrived. The basic argument in Janus is that the First Amendment should be interpreted to shield workers who don’t like their union from having to associate with it or lend support to its activities. The Supreme Court rejected that argument in 1977 when it decided Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, and it has rejected analogous arguments in other compulsory-fee situations, including state bar dues for lawyers and mandatory student association fees on public campuses. The underlying argument in support of these mandatory fees is the greater common good; the specific rationale in the labor context is that the presence of free riders, who enjoy the benefits of having a union while refusing to pay for the bargaining efforts that won them, is a threat to peace in the workplace. "
489,"President Trump recently made an offer to National Football League players like us who are committed to protesting injustice. Instead of protesting, he suggested, we should give him names of people we believe were “unfairly treated by the justice system.” If he agrees they were treated unfairly, he said, he will pardon them. To be sure, the president’s clemency power can be a valuable tool for redressing injustice. Just look at Alice Johnson, age 63, who was serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug conviction until her sentence was commuted by President Trump. He should be commended for using his clemency power in that case. But a handful of pardons will not address the sort of systemic injustice that N.F.L. players have been protesting. These are problems that our government has created, many of which occur at the local level. If President Trump thinks he can end these injustices if we deliver him a few names, he hasn’t been listening to us. As Americans, it is our constitutional right to question injustices when they occur, and we see them daily: police brutality, unnecessary incarceration, excessive criminal sentencing, residential segregation and educational inequality. The United States effectively uses prison to treat addiction, and you could argue it is also our largest mental-health provider. Law enforcement has a responsibility to serve its communities, yet this responsibility has too often not met basic standards of accountability. These injustices are so widespread as to seem practically written into our nation’s DNA. We must challenge these norms, investigate the reasons for their pervasiveness and fight with all we have to change them. That is what we, as football players, are trying to do with our activism. President Trump could help. He could use his powers, including the clemency power, to make a real dent in the federal prison population. People like Alice Johnson, for example, should not be given de facto life sentences for nonviolent drug crimes in the first place. The president could stop that from happening by issuing a blanket pardon for people in that situation who have already served long sentences. "
490,"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia  — A few weeks ago, a woman —  a prominent media consultant — and her two daughters were shopping at the upscale Kingdom Center mall here. Her daughters, both in their early 20s, had their heads covered on this shopping trip. Hers was not. At the approach of members of the Saudi religious police, whose official mission is to promote virtue and prevent vice, she reached for her head scarf. She did not, however, put it on. Enough already, she thought. “Cover your head!” the agents ordered her. “No.” “Well,” they muttered, “may God protect you.” With that, the bearded enforcers limped away. They used to descend on stores that sell the shapeless black gowns called abayas imposed on Saudi women, scoop up those with any adornment — a trace of color, beads — and burn them. No longer: These once-feared upholders of a puritanical Islamic order are now defanged — completely neutered, as the woman put it to me. On Sunday, Saudi women will start driving, consigning, at last, a conspicuous symbol of such oppression to the scrapheap. These are heady days in the Saudi Arabia of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as M.B.S., who became heir to the throne in a virtual palace coup a year ago, ousting his cousin Mohammed bin Nayef. He’s a hard-charging 32-year-old disrupter. President Trump has embraced the prince as his lost Middle Eastern son, a young man who hates Iran, hates political Islam and loves money. It’s a risky bet that a rash upstart can end the Saudi bargain with the devil that contributed to jihadist terrorism around the world. To some degree, the level of violence and instability in the Arab world will depend on the Saudi experiment. "
491,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The key to holding President Trump accountable is the defeat of congressional Republicans in this year’s midterm elections. But the key to minimizing the damage he can do until then is working with those same Republicans. Trump’s decision to fold on family separations at the border is a case study. As subservient to Trump as other Republicans have often been — starting with the Russia investigation — they remain, above all, politicians who want to get re-elected. When they can be persuaded that Trump is doing something so unpopular that it hurts their political standing, they will distance themselves from him. And when they do, they can make it very difficult for him to do what he wants. “The events of the past week,” the political scientist Yascha Mounk writes in Slate, “make clear that some of the very same people who favor real curbs on migration, and might even cheer the idea of some kind of wall on large parts of the southern border, will not stand for the separation of children from their parents.” This fight isn’t over, though. Trump appears to be using the crisis — which, of course, he created — to win legal approval to detain entire families for longer than the law currently allows, Vox’s Dara Lind explains. And it remains unclear what will happen to the more than 2,000 children who were previously separated from their parents, as The New Yorker’s John Cassidy writes. In The Times, Andrew Cuomo, Charles Blow, Nick Kristof and Richard Parker weigh in on the crisis. ‘The threat of this presidency.’ Michael Bloomberg isn’t just a Democrat who pretends to be an independent. Yes, he’s decidedly liberal on some major issues, like climate change and gun control. But he is well to the right of many Democrats on other issues, including education, policing, business regulation and foreign policy. In recent years, he has donated to both Republican and Democratic campaigns. So why is he giving tens of millions of his dollars to Democratic campaigns this year? Because he understands that this isn’t a normal campaign. It’s not merely about policy issues. It’s about democracy and the rule of law. Trump rejects some basic American values, and congressional Republicans have made clear that they aren’t going to hold him accountable on many of the biggest issues. Which leaves only the Democrats. Bloomberg explains: “Congress has essentially stopped acting as a co-equal branch of government, by failing to engage in the kind of oversight of the law that the Constitution requires and the public expects.” As Joseph Crowley, a Queens Democrat in the House, who speaks regularly with Bloomberg, put it: Bloomberg “recognizes the threat of this presidency.” I hope that some Republican voters recognize the threat, too.

492,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) They paved paradise and put up a lot of parking lots. That was the way some national parks coped with the surge in visitors in recent decades. We published an article this week on a project that did the reverse — restored the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias in Yosemite National Park partly by tearing up a lot of asphalt and hauling it away. The Muir Woods National Monument, the grove of centuries-old coastal redwoods in Marin County, is undergoing a similar multimillion-dollar transformation, albeit more gradually. In January the park instituted a mandatory parking reservation system to mitigate overcrowding. A shuttle bus from other parking areas also requires reservations. The result has been a 20 percent reduction in the number of visitors to Muir Woods, which is across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco. Visitors numbered 72,790 in April this year compared with 92,589 during the same month last year, according to the Park Service. Next summer the park will begin tearing up parking lots, relocating and renovating them, possibly using a more natural material than asphalt. “At the end of the day that is the goal — a smaller footprint and more that is natural and vegetative,” said Mia Monroe, a community liaison ranger at Muir Woods who has helped lead the restoration. “We are trying to move all of our infrastructure out of sensitive areas.” The park will relocate wastewater pipes, renovate paths and footbridges, help restore salmon populations in the Redwood Creek by removing boulders and replacing them with a more fish-friendly habitat.

493,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Administration Leaves U.N. Human Rights Council” (news article, June 20): The main problem with the United Nations Human Rights Council is not merely “frequent criticism of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians.” Instead, it is the council’s Agenda Item 7, which dedicates an entire agenda item to scrutiny of only Israel.

Overnight, their jobs had changed from processing passports and visas from their offices in Midtown Manhattan and on Park Avenue to providing emergency humanitarian aid to children taken from their parents under a Trump Administration policy. But the first step was finding them. That process was thrown into more disarray on Wednesday when President Trump signed an executive order ending the policy that separated children from their parents. It appeared that children were continuing to arrive in New York as late as Wednesday night. Consular offices are often involved in cases of unaccompanied migrant youth, especially when children want to return to their countries voluntarily. But this situation was “atypical,” according to José Vicente Chinchilla, the consul general of El Salvador, because they did not even know children separated from their families were coming to New York, let alone how many. “To be honest, I don’t have a number,” he said on Wednesday, noting that the federal authorities had not responded to requests for information. “For the moment,” Mr. Chinchilla said, “there has been no contact.” The federal agency that cares for unaccompanied minors — the Office of Refugee Resettlement — had not informed consular officials in New York of any shift in policy before news broke on Wednesday that more than 300 children had been sent to New York.

495,"WASHINGTON — Americans have done more and more of their shopping online in recent years, drawn by the promise of low prices, wide selection and buy-from-home convenience. But e-commerce has also had another edge: Many of those sales were, in effect, tax-free. The Supreme Court on Thursday moved to close that loophole, ruling that internet retailers can be required to collect sales taxes even in states where they have no physical presence. The decision, in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., was a victory for brick-and-mortar businesses that have long complained they are put at a disadvantage by having to charge sales taxes while many online competitors do not. And it was also a victory for states that have said that they are missing out on tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. “State and local governments have really been dealing with a nightmare scenario for several years now,” said Carl Davis, research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a Washington think tank. “This is going to allow state and local governments to improve their tax enforcement and to put local business on a more level playing field.” In Thursday’s ruling, the court effectively overturned a system that it created. In 1992, the court ruled in Quill Corporation v. North Dakota that the Constitution bars states from requiring businesses to collect sales tax unless they have a substantial connection to the state. The Quill decision helped pave the way for the growth of online retail by letting companies sell nationwide without navigating the complex patchwork of state and local tax codes. But as online retailing has grown, the dynamics have shifted. Online sellers are no longer scrappy upstarts competing with more established businesses. Amazon had $119 billion in revenue from product sales last year, making it bigger than all but the largest traditional retailers. "
496,"Good Thursday. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. The House of Mouse sweetened its takeover bid for most of 21st Century Fox to $38 a share, leapfrogging Comcast’s $35-a-share bid. The new offer was cleverly structured to please both the Murdochs and other Fox investors, with a mix of cash and stock. Expect Comcast to counter soon. But time may not be on its side: Bloomberg reports that the Justice Department could clear Disney’s prospective deal within weeks, putting Comcast far behind in the race for regulatory approval. One option that’s now unlikely: A truce between Fox’s suitors, splitting up the Murdoch media empire. Disney’s C.E.O., Bob Iger, told analysts yesterday that his company has legally pledged not to do that. Elsewhere in media M. & A.: Some pundits expect much more consolidation. Here’s why they may be wrong. With growth rates hitting levels unseen in a decade, President Trump is betting that the U.S. can weather any short-term shocks from his battles with China, Europe and other trading partners. "
497,"It’s 1980, just after the Iranian revolution, and a young man of 16, born into a well-placed family in the Shah’s Iran, finds himself adrift in Los Angeles. His mother has stayed behind in Tehran and his father, a successful businessman and ex-boxer of legendary machismo, drops dead of a heart attack on a squash court, leaving the teenager and his two younger brothers penniless. The teen is slight with large lugubrious eyes crowned by dense eyebrows, his cheeks lightly pocked by adolescence; he hustles to survive, working nightshifts in seedy motels. Theater is his passion. As a child, he’d staged plays at home with siblings, cousins and the help. By 14, at his rural boarding school in England, he was assistant directing Ibsen’s “Peer Gynt.” In Los Angeles, he finds unusual homes for his theatrical productions, often extravagant multi-hour riffs on classics such as “Medea’’ or “King Lear,” in makeshift theaters, including an indoor basketball court. At 23, he directs his first major play at the prestigious Los Angeles Theatre Center. At 32, with more than a dozen plays under his belt and an outsized reputation as a theatrical wunderkind, he dies in New York from AIDS-related causes. Reza Abdoh’s plays were, by all accounts, a combined assault on the eyes, ears and soul. He was a sort of collage artist, indulging in conventions of the avant-garde, but also those of advertising, music videos and the nonstop schlock of cable television. Critics rarely minced words about the work. It was either maddening, incomprehensible or life-changing; sometimes it was all three. Reaganism, militarism, racism and homophobia was the toxic brew in which his art came to be. After he was diagnosed with H.I.V. in 1988, the specter of a disease that had already, frostily, been declared the “gay plague” was channeled into his plays, too. A recurring motif from his last production, “Quotations From a Ruined City” (1994), is a man wearing an oxygen mask, desperately gasping for breath. In the years since his death, mention of Abdoh’s name evokes either tales of mythological excess or vague recognition. He was the auteur who staged plays in abandoned warehouses, meat lockers and hotel rooms, who featured BDSM sex acts and incorporated dance sequences of breathtaking vigor and beauty. Near the end of his life, Abdoh insisted that he didn’t want his plays to be restaged. Traces of his work were to be found on videotapes lovingly passed around experimental theater circles, a little bit like samizdat. These videos, vital and yet never quite like the experience of having sat through a production, still have the power to startle viewers. Like electric jolts. On June 3, “Reza Abdoh,” the first large-scale exhibition devoted to Abdoh’s life and art opened at MoMA PS1 in New York. The show revisits Abdoh’s seminal plays — “The Hip-Hop Waltz of Eurydice” (1990), “Bogeyman” (1991), “The Law of Remains” (1992) and “Quotations,” along with “Tight Right White” (1993), a searing, no-holds-barred meditation on racism and sexism in America. T asked me, as an editor of the arts journal Bidoun and the show’s co-organizer (the other organizers are Tiffany Malakooti and Babak Radboy of Bidoun, alongside the MoMA chief curator at large and PS1 director Klaus Biesenbach), to sit down for a conversation with two giants of American theater to discuss Adboh’s work. Richard Foreman, the author, director and designer of more than 50 plays, is known for his “total theater,” a disorienting amalgam that puts language — its soaring potentials, its limitations — at the center of his experimental work. Peter Sellars’s riveting, idiosyncratic takes on classical plays and operas has made him one of the most original, if occasionally controversial, directors of the last decades. In 1988, he staged Mozart’s “The Marriage of Figaro” on the 52nd floor of Trump Tower. Crucially, both men had personal experience of Abdoh’s visceral work. The conversation was recorded at Foreman’s SoHo apartment, a cavernous, almost anachronistic space given the neighborhood’s current airbrushed aesthetic, packed with thousands of books and the lovely detritus of 40 years in the trenches of the theatrical avant-garde. We called Sellars, who lives in Los Angeles, over Skype. — Negar Azimi "
498,"WASHINGTON — James Alex Fields Jr., the suspect in the death of a woman who was mowed down along with others by a car last summer at a counterprotest to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., was indicted on Wednesday on federal hate crime charges. The charges stood in contrast to President Trump’s refusal to condemn white supremacists and neo-Nazis after the woman, Heather Heyer, was fatally struck. He declared that “many sides” shared blame as the violence touched off a firestorm over race relations in the United States. “Last summer’s violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement on Wednesday. “Today’s indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation.” Viewed with skepticism by civil rights advocates for his ambivalence over expanding protections for minorities, Mr. Sessions has nonetheless made enforcement of hate crime laws a key part of his civil rights agenda and his broader tough-on-crime platform. “Hate crimes are violent crimes,” Mr. Sessions, one of the first administration officials to forcefully denounce Ms. Heyer’s death, said last year. Mr. Fields, 21, was charged in the Western District of Virginia with one count of a hate crime resulting in the death of Ms. Heyer, as well as dozens of other counts of hate crime acts, which each carry a possible sentence of life in prison. He also faces first-degree murder charges in state court; the authorities say he drove the car that killed Ms. Heyer and injured dozens. Federal prosecutors charged Mr. Fields under two hate crime statutes that require proof that he was motivated to cause harm to other people because of their actual or perceived race, color, religion or national origin. "
499,"The Department of Justice approved the Walt Disney Company’s $71 billion bid for the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox on Wednesday, potentially complicating Comcast’s desire to make a rival offer for Rupert Murdoch’s entertainment empire. The government’s approval was filed in federal court on the condition that Disney, which already owns ESPN, divest all of Fox’s 22 regional sports networks, which include valuable channels like the Yankees’ YES network. “Today’s settlement will ensure that sports programming competition is preserved in the local markets where Disney and Fox compete for cable and satellite distribution,” Makan Delrahim, the head the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a statement. In December, Disney and Fox agreed to an all-stock deal worth $52.4 billion. Then, two weeks ago, Comcast made an offer for the Fox assets that was worth about $65 billion. That prompted Disney to come back with its richer offer, a mix of cash and stock, which Fox promptly accepted. The green light from the Justice Department makes it more difficult for Comcast to mount a competitive counteroffer. The cable giant, which also owns NBCUniversal, will have to raise even more cash, adding to its debt, and convince Fox’s board that it, too, would gain government approval. Comcast, which already controls nine regional sports networks, has signaled that it would also be willing to sell Fox’s regional sports networks. Fox has not yet set a date for its shareholders to vote on the Disney deal. At stake are cable channels including FX and National Geographic, the “Avatar” and “X-Men” film franchises, and a pair of international television networks: the European pay-TV operator Sky and Star India. Those two networks, which are growing businesses with an emphasis on streaming services, are key attractions for both Disney and Comcast. In addition, the winner gets control of the streaming service Hulu, which has more than 20 million customers. "
500,"WASHINGTON — Bill Shine, a former Fox News executive who was close to Roger E. Ailes, the network’s ousted chairman, is expected to be offered the job of White House communications director, according to four people familiar with the decision. Mr. Shine, who was forced out as co-president at Fox News last May for his handling of sexual harassment scandals at the network, has met with President Trump in recent weeks about taking the West Wing communications job, which has been vacant since Hope Hicks left the job in March. Four people familiar with the decision said it was likely to be announced and that the president had offered him the job. But the move has not been finalized, in part because of the president’s mercurial decision-making process and also because of Mr. Shine’s reluctance to walk into a chaotic West Wing. As recently as a month ago, Mr. Shine didn’t want the job, according to a person familiar with his thinking. The former television executive was reluctant to deal with all the scrutiny, part of which could focus on his own connection to the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News, the person said. On Wednesday, Mr. Shine did not respond to a request for comment, and the White House did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. Mr. Shine was a central figure at Fox News during the era that the late Mr. Ailes was the company’s dominant player, helping to turn the broadcast network into a powerful conservative force in television and politics. "
501,"BRUSSELS — Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said on Wednesday that the policies of President Trump had put trans-Atlantic relations “under tremendous pressure” and that Europeans should prepare for darker times. As a trade war looms between the United States and the European Union, with retaliation for American tariffs on steel and aluminum and threats of further tariffs on imported cars, Mr. Tusk said in a letter to the heads of government of the European Union that “unfortunately the divisions go beyond trade.” Mr. Tusk, in his letter, took note of a rancorous meeting this month of the Group of 7 industrialized countries, when Mr. Trump mocked European leaders and criticized their trade policies and military spending. “It is my belief that, while hoping for the best, we must be ready to prepare our Union for worst-case scenarios,” Mr. Tusk said. Without calling out the American president by name, Mr. Tusk also criticized Mr. Trump and his immigration policies, using Twitter to denounce those who support “anti-European & anti-liberal” views.

503,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Big news from the Supreme Court. In the morning, justices dealt a heavy blow to labor unions, saying that nonmembers are not required to pay agency fees. Public-sector unions, including those for teachers, could lose major funding and see membership drop, but our analysis is that labor will not necessarily become weaker. In the afternoon, Justice Anthony Kennedy, above, made even bigger headlines by announcing his retirement. A Reagan appointee, he was the court’s leading champion of gay rights and often a crossover vote. Our Supreme Court correspondent called the news a “judicial earthquake.” _____ 2.

504,"WASHINGTON — The House resoundingly rejected a far-reaching immigration overhaul on Wednesday, despite a last-minute plea from President Trump, as internal divisions in the Republican ranks continued to hobble legislative efforts to protect the young unauthorized immigrants known as Dreamers. The 121-to-301 vote was an embarrassment both to Mr. Trump and to House Republican leaders, who had spent weeks trying to bring together conservatives and Republicans with moderate views on immigration — and ended up with little to show for the effort. In the end, nearly as many Republicans voted against the bill, 112, as for it, 121. The defeat provided the latest display of the Republican Party’s disunity in Congress on immigration. And it highlighted the continuing inability of both the House and the Senate to resolve the fate of the Dreamers, who were brought to the country illegally as children. Many of those undocumented immigrants have been shielded from deportation under an Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which Mr. Trump moved last year to end. Republicans in the House are now likely to turn their focus to narrower legislation that would seek to keep migrant families together at the border, an issue that senators are also looking to address. But with the Fourth of July approaching and lawmakers close to returning home for a recess, it was not clear how quickly a narrower measure might move forward. The House is scheduled to finish its work for the week on Thursday and not return until July 10. A Republican aide said the chamber would not take action on the family separation issue until after the recess. The frustrations over immigration in Congress are matched by the confusion in the Trump administration. A federal judge in California issued a nationwide injunction on Tuesday stopping the administration from separating children from their parents at the border and ordering that all families already separated be reunited within 30 days. "
505,"WASHINGTON — President Trump plans to meet President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia next month in a one-on-one summit meeting, a politically sensitive encounter that could exacerbate strains with NATO allies even if it eases tensions between the United States and Russia. It would be the first formal summit meeting specifically for Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin, who have met twice at annual gatherings of world leaders. And it comes at a particularly delicate moment, with midterm elections looming in the United States and the special counsel’s investigation of Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia grinding on. But the president has expressed a determination to meet with Mr. Putin, administration officials said, especially in the aftermath of his encounter with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, which Mr. Trump celebrated as a diplomatic triumph — even if it has produced little in the way of tangible results. Mr. Trump dispatched to Moscow his national security adviser, John R. Bolton, who met on Wednesday with Mr. Putin. Afterward, Mr. Bolton said a time and place for the meeting would be announced Thursday. Other administration officials said Helsinki, Finland, was a prime candidate. “Getting along with Russia, and with China, and with everybody, is a very good thing,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office later Wednesday. “So we’ll probably be meeting sometime around my trip to Europe.” Mr. Trump is scheduled to attend a NATO summit meeting in Brussels on July 11 and 12, followed by a long-delayed visit to Britain. He could add another stop on the European trip to get together with Mr. Putin. "
506,"Ronda Fox finally got the news last week, three months into planting season: The federal government approved her application to employ more than a dozen temporary foreign workers for her family-owned landscaping business in Aurora, Colo. She had hoped to have her crew in place by April 1, but had initially lost out in this year’s visa lottery. “Better late than never,” Ms. Fox said. In Centennial, a quick car ride away, Phil Steinhauer faced the same hiring challenge for his landscaping business. But his application for 150 temporary foreign workers was selected through the federal lottery in the first round, and his hires were in place when the season started. Mr. Steinhauer, though, is far from satisfied with the way he had to fill the jobs. “You can’t build a business on a lottery,” he said. What the two business owners have in common is their reliance on the H-2B visa program, which allows unskilled workers from Mexico, the Philippines, Jamaica and dozens of other countries to take temporary nonfarm jobs in the United States. Debates over using foreign workers for seasonal labor — lower-wage jobs that Americans have spurned — have been as constant as the calendar. But a tight labor market and the fraught politics of immigration have added new urgency to the issue in an election year when Republicans and Democrats are wrestling for control in Congress. "
507,"For much of his 30-year tenure on the Supreme Court, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy served as the decisive vote in several closely watched, divisive cases. His retirement at the end of next month will pave the way for a contentious fight to determine the future direction of the Supreme Court. A Trump appointee would likely create a five-member conservative majority that would potentially cripple or undo previous rulings on abortion rights, affirmative action and the death penalty — cases where Justice Kennedy left his mark by siding with the four liberal justices. The following are some of the landmark cases where Justice Kennedy served as the deciding factor. Justice Kennedy, a champion of gay rights, wrote every majority decision for landmark gay rights cases, most notably the 2015 decision that granted same-sex couples the right to get married.   "
508,"China and Russia, apparently seeking to exploit an American wish to lower spending at the United Nations, want to cut more than 200 jobs related to human rights and the prevention of sexual abuse in the organization’s peacekeeping missions, according to diplomats and budget-negotiation documents. Human rights advocates said such cuts, if accepted, would severely hurt United Nations peacekeeping operations covering some of the world’s most vulnerable countries. Roughly 450 jobs are devoted to the protection of human rights and the deterrence of sexual abuse in the peacekeeping system, diplomats said. The push by China and Russia comes at a time when the Trump administration is distancing itself in some ways from the United Nations — although the United States is still the host country and remains by far the biggest financial contributor. At the same time, China in particular is exerting more influence at the organization as its economic importance and contributions increase. China and Russia have long complained about the human rights work of the United Nations, especially in its peacekeeping missions, which they see as falling outside the scope of what the blue-helmeted soldiers of troop-contributing countries should be doing. But United Nations diplomats said both China and Russia seemed more aggressive this year about wanting to cut jobs they deemed to be wasteful or irrelevant. The Russians are proposing reductions of up to 50 percent in funding for human rights work and the prevention of sexual abuse, which some diplomats have calculated would, if fully carried out, eliminate roughly 170 jobs. China has proposed cuts of about 37 jobs, including vacant positions that may be about to be filled. "
509,"President Trump has spent two days pummeling Harley-Davidson over its decision to move some production abroad, threatening to tax the motorcycle company and warning it would lose its American allure. Then it appeared as if Harley-Davidson’s chief executive was punching back with a quote disparaging Mr. Trump. Except the quote was fake. Harley-Davidson is suffering the fate of many of those who tangle with the president: Twitter trolls. Since announcing this week that it would relocate some of its production to mitigate the impact of retaliatory European tariffs, Harley-Davidson’s chief executive has been the subject of an online smear campaign. On Tuesday night, a fake quote critical of Mr. Trump and attributed to the company’s chief executive, Matthew Levatich, began circulating on Twitter. The quote, which disparaged Mr. Trump’s understanding of trade and economics, was being spread by some accounts with very few followers, but quickly went viral. The company was inundated with queries about its veracity. Michael Pflughoeft, a spokesman for Harley-Davidson, said that the anti-Trump quote linked to the company’s chief executive that was circulating on Twitter in various forms was “absolutely, unequivocally fake and false.” "
510,"With the Supreme Court striking down laws that require government workers to pay union fees, one thing is clear: Most public-sector unions in more than 20 states with such laws are going to get smaller and poorer in the coming years. Though it is difficult to predict with precision, experts and union officials say they could lose 10 percent to one-third of their members, or more, in the states affected, as conservative groups seek to persuade workers to drop out. The court’s decision is the latest evidence that moves to weaken unions are exacting a major toll. Beyond the dropout campaigns aimed at members, conservatives are bringing lawsuits to retroactively recover fees collected by unions from nonmembers. [Read more about the justices’ ruling and their reasoning.] In May, President Trump signed three executive orders making it easier to fire government workers and reining in the role of unions representing federal workers. Dropping out of a union is a more attractive proposition now that workers no longer have to pay a so-called agency fee, typically about 80 percent of union dues, if they choose not to belong to a union. (Those doing so generally account for a small fraction of the workers whom public-sector unions represent.) In the five years after Michigan passed a law ending mandatory union fees in 2012, the number of active members of the Michigan Education Association dropped by about 25 percent, according to government filings, a much faster attrition rate than before. Its annual receipts fell by more than 10 percent, adjusting for inflation. "
511,"It has been months of whiplash for teachers unions. The nation’s highest court decided on Wednesday that they, and other public sector unions, can no longer collect agency fees, which are currently mandatory in 22 states. The ruling came down after the unions racked up a series of victories early this year, taking part in teacher walkouts in six states and winning raises and new education dollars from conservative lawmakers. Now, teachers unions could lose up to a third of their members and funding as a result of the decision, labor experts say, some of the same money that fueled the walkouts. “Members and money are power in politics,” said Terry Moe, a Stanford political science professor who has written critically of the unions. “This will weaken the teachers unions nationwide as a political force.” The walkout movement began in West Virginia, where agency fees are already outlawed, and was largely driven by rank-and-file teachers, not union leaders. While union members pay dues, agency fees cover the costs of representing nonmember teachers in contract negotiations and disputes with management. The decision in the Supreme Court case, Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, “will affect us, because it’s going to hurt the national” unions that provided crucial support, said Jay O’Neal, a West Virginia teacher and a leader of the protests. "
512,"To the Editor: Re “Facing Tariffs, American Icon Retreats in U.S.” (front page, June 26): After reading about Harley-Davidson, and its announcement that it is going to move some production of motorcycles overseas to avoid stiff tariffs, I wondered what kind of a businessman President Trump really is, especially with his comment about Harley-Davidson raising the “white flag.” It seems to me that Harley-Davidson made a good business decision. It answers first to its shareholders, who should applaud the decision, however unfortunate it is. The president should be reconsidering all of his tariffs, and especially those that affect our friends. STEPHEN BRILL
COTTAGE GROVE, MINN. "
513,"WASHINGTON — Trump administration officials said on Wednesday that it would be difficult to comply with the timetable in a federal court order requiring the reunification of migrant children and parents who were separated at the border. Judge Dana M. Sabraw of the Federal District Court in San Diego issued a preliminary injunction on Tuesday that stops the practice of separating children and parents. And he set a strict timetable. Children under the age of 5 must be reunited with their parents within 14 days, he said, and other minor children must be reunited within 30 days — unless a parent is found to be unfit or to present a danger to the child. The ruling came as a surprise to Trump administration officials responsible for more than 2,000 children who have been separated from their parents and are being held at more than 100 sites in 17 states. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services said they were trying to put children and parents in touch with one another, but were not planning to release children while their parents were being detained to face prosecution on charges of trying to enter the United States illegally. Moreover, the officials said, they must confirm that adults claiming children are actually their parents, and that the adults pose no danger to the children. "
514,"It wasn’t long ago that the term “middle class” suggested security, conformity and often complacency — a cohort that was such a reliable feature of postwar American life that it attracted not just political pandering but also cultural ridicule. The stereotype included everyone from men in gray flannel suits to the slick professionals of “Thirtysomething,” stuck or smug in their world of bourgeois comforts. “Squeezed: Why Our Families Can’t Afford America,” a timely new book by the journalist and poet Alissa Quart, arrives at a moment when members of the middle class are no longer a robust demographic but an embattled and shrinking population, struggling to hold on to their delicate perch in an unforgiving economic order. These aren’t the truly poor but those in the “just-making-it group,” or what Quart also calls “the Middle Precariat.” The people she talks to believed their educations and backgrounds (most of them grew up in middle-class homes) would guarantee some financial stability; instead, their work is “inconstant or contingent,” and their incomes are stagnant or worse. “They are people on the brink who did everything ‘right,’” Quart writes, “and yet the math of their family lives is simply not adding up.” Quart describes her own experience of slipping into the “falling middle-class vortex” after the birth of her daughter seven years ago, a time when she and her husband were freelance writers facing new child care costs and hospital bills. She eventually became the executive editor of the Economic Hardship Reporting Project, a nonprofit organization founded by the journalist Barbara Ehrenreich, but her family had a “few years of fiscal vertigo.” Quart includes herself in the group she’s writing about; her book succeeds and suffers accordingly. As she puts it in her introduction, the concerns of her subjects “were not abstract to me.” Quart is a sympathetic listener, getting people to reveal not just the tenuousness of their economic situations but also the turbulence of their emotional lives. A chapter on middle-age job-seekers who once worked as computer programmers or newspaper reporters captures the fallout of a discriminatory job market, which tells older unemployed people they should buck up and start over while also making them feel superfluous. “I’ve tried to reinvent myself so many times,” an aeronautical-engineer-turned-website-designer-turned-personal-chef tells her. “To be honest, it hasn’t worked.” The woman is now in her 50s, with two grown daughters and plenty of debt from culinary school. “The world has evolved beyond me,” she says. "
515,"WASHINGTON — Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced on Wednesday that he would retire this summer, setting in motion a furious fight over the future of the Supreme Court and giving President Trump the chance to put a conservative stamp on the American legal system for generations. Justice Kennedy, 81, has been a critical swing vote on the sharply polarized court for nearly three decades as he embraced liberal views on gay rights, abortion and the death penalty but helped conservatives trim voting rights, block gun control measures and unleash campaign spending by corporations. His replacement by a conservative justice — something Mr. Trump has vowed to his supporters — could imperil a variety of landmark Supreme Court precedents on social issues where Justice Kennedy frequently sided with his liberal colleagues, particularly on abortion. Mr. Trump and his Republican allies have hoped for months that Justice Kennedy might retire, clearing a way for a new, more conservative jurist before Democrats had an opportunity to capture the Senate and block future Republican nominees. In contrast to his frequent criticisms of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., a generally reliable conservative, Mr. Trump has frequently heaped praise on Justice Kennedy and even has suggested that he might nominate one of his former clerks to the bench — subtle nudges the president hoped would make Justice Kennedy more comfortable with the idea of stepping down. Justice Kennedy’s departure could leave Chief Justice Roberts, who was appointed by George W. Bush, as the decisive vote on a court whose other justices may soon include four committed liberals and four equally committed conservatives. The court’s term that just ended offered a preview of what such a lineup might mean: With Justice Kennedy mostly siding with conservatives this year, the court endorsed Mr. Trump’s power over immigration, dealt a blow to labor unions and backed a Republican purge of voter rolls in Ohio. "
516,"The great, gradual migration of the human population from the countryside to the city has transformed the world, but we’ve barely begun to reckon with its political implications. Over generations, urbanization has sorted us on the traits — ethnicity, education level, personal temperament — that draw us toward cities or keep us away. The logic of our electoral institutions has always sorted the bulk of American voters into one of two major parties. What’s new is that the sorting dynamic of urbanization now accounts for partisan sorting, too. Democrats have become the party of the multicultural city, Republicans the party of the monocultural country — the party of urbanization-resistant white people. Such a clean partisan break along density lines has thrown our democracy into a crisis of legitimacy and dysfunction. Our federal system of democratic representation has drifted dangerously out of sync with the geographic distribution, demographic makeup and outsize economic role of America’s urbanized population. Our politics is cracking up over the density divide. Big cities and their distinctive interests are suffering a density penalty and need more visibility in our scheme of representation. “As you go from the center of cities out through the suburbs and into rural areas, you traverse in a linear fashion from Democratic to Republican places,” observed Jonathan Rodden, a Stanford political scientist. According to an estimate from Mark Muro of the Brookings Institution, the electorate is typically equal parts Democrat and Republican at about 900 people per square mile. The exact number is higher in more Republican and lower in more Democratic states, but majorities tend to flip from blue to red roughly where commuter suburbs give way to “exurban” sprawl. Higher population density predicts higher Democratic vote share even in small cities in deep-red counties in deep-red states. Mr. Rodden has shown heavy concentrations of Democratic voters in the relatively dense historic cores of cities like Scranton, Pa., and Terre Haute, Ind., that wash out with distance from city hall. So there are really no red states or blue states. There’s compact blue urban density and sprawling red sparseness. "
517,"To the Editor: Re “Democratic Power Broker, Once a Possible House Leader, Loses New York Primary” (front page, June 27): It is refreshing that an unknown newcomer, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, dethroned an established leader of the Democratic Party, Representative Joseph Crowley. This election result should be a wake-up call to established political parties and their enablers. They do not seem to grasp that the citizens of this country are fed up. It was the tone-deaf established political parties on both sides that enabled Donald Trump to capture the throne! BHASKARA CHARY, SOMERS, N.Y. To the Editor: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who defeated the incumbent, Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, is an impressive figure. But recent history suggests caution in reading too much into her victory in a liberal district. Leftists hoping to ride a progressive wave by refusing to vote for more traditional Democratic candidates should be reminded of the wipeout in 2016 and the continuing ripple effects seen in this week’s Supreme Court decisions that came down on the side of Donald Trump. NANCY LEDERMAN, NEW YORK "
518,"During World War II, about 120,000 men, women and children of Japanese descent, including almost 40,000 foreign nationals living on the West Coast, were removed from their homes, forced to forfeit their possessions and then incarcerated on the basis of military orders authorized by the president. My father, Fred, and others who defied the military orders were criminally charged and imprisoned. Defending themselves against the charges, my father, along with Gordon Hirabayashi and Minoru Yasui, all United States citizens, challenged the constitutionality of the orders. In a series of decisions, the Supreme Court upheld his and the others’ convictions in 1943 and 1944. In those now infamous decisions, which constitutional scholars on both sides of the political aisle have criticized, the Supreme Court deferred to the government’s assertions that its racially discriminatory policies were justified by military necessity. But history proved otherwise. In extraordinary legal proceedings that vacated my father’s conviction nearly 40 years later in 1983, evidence of government misconduct showed that the “military necessity” on which the court predicated its decision was apparently nothing more than a smoke screen. The real reason for the government’s deplorable treatment of Japanese Americans was not acts of espionage but rather a baseless perception of disloyalty grounded in racial stereotypes. His victory in a Federal District Court meant that the Supreme Court would not hear his case, leaving the 1944 decision intact, though almost universally discredited. When President Trump used questionable evidence to issue executive orders last year banning immigration from predominantly Muslim countries, I heard the same kind of stereotypes that targeted the Japanese-Americans in World War II being used against Muslims. So I, along with the children of Mr. Hirabayashi and Mr. Yasui, asked the Supreme Court to reject President Trump’s orders. We pointed to our fathers’ cases as an urgent warning against executive power run amok. And we implored the court to repudiate its decisions in those cases while affirming their greater legacy: Blind deference to the executive branch, even in areas in which the president must wield wide discretion, is incompatible with the protection of fundamental freedoms. Meaningful judicial review is an essential element of a healthy democracy. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court got it partly right. After nearly 75 years, the court officially overruled Korematsu v. United States. In the majority decision, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., citing language used in a dissent to the 1944 ruling, wrote that the court was taking “the opportunity to make express what is already obvious: Korematsu was gravely wrong the day it was decided, has been overruled in the court of history, and — to be clear — ‘has no place in law under the Constitution.’” "
519,"• Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced that he would retire, setting the stage for a furious fight over the direction of the Supreme Court. • President Trump said he would move quickly to name a replacement. He also said his nominee would be drawn from a list of 25 names that the White House issued in November. • Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said the Senate would vote on a replacement this fall. • Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, called on Mr. McConnell to delay a vote until after the midterm elections. But the Democrats have few options to actually block consideration of a nominee. Any Democratic hopes that Mr. McConnell might hold up the Senate’s consideration of Justice Kennedy’s successor until after the midterm elections were quickly put to rest. Mr. McConnell took to the Senate floor not long after Justice Kennedy’s announcement to make clear that he expected to begin consideration of a replacement as soon as possible. “The Senate stands ready to fulfill its constitutional role by offering advice and consent on President Trump’s nominee to fill this vacancy,” Mr. McConnell said. “We will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy’s successor this fall.” "
520,"BEIJING — When Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met with President Xi Jinping of China on Wednesday, he hoped to start a conversation on China’s position in the South China Sea. He left knowing just how firm Mr. Xi is on the issue. “We cannot lose even one inch of the territory left behind by our ancestors,” Mr. Xi told him, according to Chinese state media. “What is other people’s, we do not want at all.” Disagreements between Washington and Beijing over the Chinese military’s expanding presence in the South China Sea and the American policy toward Taiwan were two of the most prominent issues raised during meetings between Mr. Mattis and senior officials in Beijing, the first stop on a trip that will take him to South Korea and Japan. Mr. Mattis, who has assailed the Chinese military for its expansion in the South China Sea, made clear the Pentagon’s stance on contested waters, stressing the need for freedom of navigation in the region and China’s adherence to international law, according to defense officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. During a meeting with his counterpart, Gen. Wei Fenghe, Mr. Mattis reminded the general of Mr. Xi’s remarks during a 2015 White House visit when Mr. Xi said he had “no intention to militarize” islands in the South China Sea, according to the officials. At a conference in Singapore this month, Mr. Mattis accused China of “intimidation and coercion” for placing surface-to-air missiles and other military equipment on islands in the South China Sea, many of which are also claimed by Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia.

521,"To the Editor: Re “Justices Back Travel Ban, Yielding to Trump” (front page, June 27) and “Justice Anthony Kennedy to Retire From Supreme Court” (nytimes.com, June 27): It is a dark hour in the history of this country. President Trump’s wall is being built, brick by invisible brick, and his vision is becoming our reality. Images of children in cages now amplified by the voice of the majority of our Supreme Court countenancing the most heinous of motives in doublespeak and pretzel-bending logic. And with the announcement on Wednesday of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s imminent retirement, another seat on this bench will become staunchly conservative, and there is one more reason to be fearful and distressed. The danger to this country comes not from without but from within. We are inch by inch and day by day abandoning our morality, turning away from the basic principles of a democracy, making Lady Liberty wonder whether she should pack her bags and move back home. We mourn for those who suffer our indignities. We feel their loss in our hearts. We hear their cries in our sleep. ROBERT S. NUSSBAUM, FORT LEE, N.J. To the Editor: After visiting the Minidoka internment camp in Idaho, where nearly 10,000 Americans of Japanese descent were imprisoned under Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Executive Order 9066, my son asked, “Could that happen to me?” This wasn’t a child’s unrealistic fear of monsters under the bed. My husband and I are his lucky and grateful adoptive parents, but our son was born in another country to a Muslim birth mother. So the heart-wrenching answer I have to give after the Supreme Court upheld anti-Muslim discrimination and President Trump’s travel ban is yes, it could happen. But I can also offer the reassurance of resistance. Yes, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in her eloquent dissent, five justices turned “a blind eye to the pain and suffering the proclamation inflicts upon countless families and individuals, many of whom are United States citizens.” Millions of us, however, are here to witness and protest this immoral decision. MARY BATTENFELD
JAMAICA PLAIN, MASS. To the Editor: Re “G.O.P. Tactics in 2016 Pay Off in Gorsuch, Who Proves Decisive Figure” (news article, June 27): The arguably unconstitutional refusal of Senate Republicans to hold hearings on the 2016 Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland, nominated by President Barack Obama, does not deserve to be called a G.O.P. “tactic.” It was, and is, cheating. DEBORAH BECK, AUSTIN, TEX. "
522,"For more than a dozen years, Justice Anthony Kennedy stood at the center of the Supreme Court. He moved the court to the right, but while he often provided a crucial fifth vote to the court’s conservative wing, Justice Kennedy sometimes voted against it. And he picked a few causes that liberals cherish, making him their occasional, if fickle, guardian angel. Among other things, Justice Kennedy was the bulwark against legal assaults against abortion, perhaps the one issue, more than any other, where the court’s influence and public attention so clearly intersect. With Justice Kennedy on the bench, the thinking among liberals went, how bad could things get? Now that he’s gone, we’re about to find out. It’s an odd moment for liberals to mourn Justice Kennedy, who’ll turn 82 next month, and for conservatives to relish his departure. He did nothing important for liberals this term, failing to provide even one crucial fifth vote to swing the outcome of a case in their direction. After he had appeared to invite a challenge to partisan gerrymandering way back in 2004, a case finally arrived in the just-concluded term, with the social science measures of partisanship he had asked for. But Justice Kennedy ducked without even writing to explain why as the court decided the case on narrow technical grounds. And though his principal left-leaning legacy is his expansion of gay rights, especially marriage equality, he settled for another narrow resolution this month, writing the majority opinion that favored the religious objections of a Colorado baker over a gay couple’s right to be treated like anyone else when they walk into a store and order a wedding cake. "
523,"WASHINGTON — Senator Mitch McConnell wasted no time on Wednesday and promised a Senate vote on a new Supreme Court nominee by the fall — and Democrats will have little power to prevent confirmation of President Trump’s choice on their own. “The Senate stands ready to fulfill its constitutional role by offering advice and consent on President Trump’s nominee to fill this vacancy,” Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said after Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced his retirement. “We will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy’s successor this fall.” The decision to move swiftly shows that Mr. McConnell and his fellow Senate Republicans do not intend to give Democrats and their allies an extended opportunity to build opposition to a nominee — or to retake the Senate and blockade confirmation as Republicans did with President Barack Obama’s nominee in 2016. The confirmation process will throw a volatile new issue into the already charged midterm campaign season, providing fresh challenges for both Republican and Democratic candidates. But it represents an opportunity for a crowning judicial triumph for Mr. McConnell, who led the blockade against Merrick B. Garland in 2016, and will now have the chance to usher a second Republican-nominated justice onto the Supreme Court in the first two years of Mr. Trump’s presidency. He has already guided scores of appeals and district court judges onto the bench. In elevating Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court last year, Republicans altered Senate rules to deny Democrats the opportunity to filibuster the nomination as well as future Supreme Court choices. That procedural change — following a similar 2013 Democratic effort to speed confirmation for lower court judges — means that Republicans can confirm a second Trump pick with only Republican votes — though they hold a very narrow 51-to-49 majority.

But being smaller and poorer doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll be weaker. Above, Gov. Bruce Rauner of Illinois, right, with Mark Janus, who sued his public sector union, outside the Supreme Court.

525,"Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced on Wednesday that he would retire from the Supreme Court. His vacancy sets up a showdown for a replacement that could change the direction of the highest court in the United States. [Read more on Trump’s Supreme Court nominees list.] President Trump said he intends to choose his next Supreme Court nominee from a list he began compiling during the 2016 presidential campaign. “I think you see the kind of quality that we’re looking at when you look at that list,” Mr. Trump said Wednesday in the Oval Office. He added, “So it will be somebody from that list.” Here is a look at some early front-runners for the job, and the full list of 25 potential nominees, as released by the White House in November. "
526,"WASHINGTON — Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao confronted protesters on Monday after they accosted her and her husband, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, over the Trump administration’s temporarily halted policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the southern border. It was the latest heated skirmish, documented on social media, between officials representing the administration and activists furious over some of its most divisive policies. In a video posted on Twitter by one of the protesters, a small group of Georgetown students walked up to Ms. Chao and Mr. McConnell on the university’s campus as they were about to enter a black SUV and leave. One protester began asking the pair, “Why are you separating families?” as audio of immigrant children crying for their parents through sobs played in the background. Mr. McConnell entered the SUV, but Ms. Chao stopped to confront the protesters as they gathered around the back of the car. “Why don’t you leave my husband alone?” she said. “Why don’t you leave my husband alone?” “I’m not trying to disrespect you,” one protester said, “but he’s separating families.” "
527,"In the middle of a national immigration firestorm over the Trump administration’s policy of separating children and parents at the southern border, and with the president tweeting that detained immigrants should be denied due process in the courts, the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency on Tuesday made an abrupt, unprecedented decision at its Lower Manhattan court: Detained immigrants in area jails would no longer be brought to court for hearings, but would have their cases heard via a video conference. Because many detainees meet their lawyers for the first time shortly before their hearings, immigration lawyers said the new policy would significantly affect their ability to represent their clients. “The fact that someone is not physically in the courtroom really hinders a lot of the less tangible aspects of our successful representation,” said Sarah Deri Oshiro, the managing director of the Immigration Practice for the Bronx Defenders. “A judge is less able to assess a person’s credibility if they are not sitting in the room.” The decision came in the wake of protests against the agency, known as ICE, orchestrated around the country last week by a group called Occupy ICE. Since Thursday, protesters have been outside the garage at 201 Varick Street in Manhattan where detainees generally enter the building. On Monday, when ICE canceled all hearings, protesters agreed to move across the street. By Wednesday morning, the group said it was ending the protests at Varick Street. A spokesman for ICE said that in-person hearings had been suspended “for the foreseeable future” at the court “to ensure the safety of ICE employees, the court, the public and detainees.” Lawyers working at the detained court on Varick Street said they first learned about the policy change Tuesday from court officials. "
528,"Democrats searching for sparks of progressive energy see the ascent of Benjamin T. Jealous in Maryland as an encouraging electoral sign. Mr. Jealous, the former head of the N.A.A.C.P., is an ally of Senator Bernie Sanders who had campaigned for governor on single-payer health care and tuition-free college, among other Sanders-like positions. On Tuesday, he emerged from a crowded Democratic primary field by beating a more moderate candidate, Rushern Baker, by more than 10 percentage points. Along with the seismic triumph of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York, his victory signaled enthusiasm behind Democratic candidates who are further to the left than many incumbents and added to the debate about how their positions will affect the party’s chances in general elections. Whatever Mr. Jealous’s odds of victory are in November, at the moment he’s widely seen as an underdog to the popular incumbent governor, Larry Hogan, a Republican who has enjoyed approval ratings in the 60s and topped out at 71 in January. A Washington Post poll from May 29 to June 3 had Mr. Hogan ahead of Mr. Jealous in a hypothetical election by 12 points. At a news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Jealous said that he was unconcerned by the odds, and that winning the primary had itself been a “steep climb.” “You tell us beating Hogan is like beating Everest? Well, we just climbed K2,” he said, referring to world’s second-highest mountain. “If you can climb K2, you can climb Everest.” "
529,"FARGO, N.D. — Hours after Justice Anthony M. Kennedy presented an opportunity to push the Supreme Court to the right with his retirement, President Trump celebrated on Wednesday night the coming nomination of his second justice, an indisputable trophy as he tries to rally support for Republicans before the midterm elections. “I’m very honored that he chose to do it during my term in office,” Mr. Trump said of Justice Kennedy during a 70-minute freewheeling speech at a rally in this Republican stronghold, “because he felt confident for me to make the right choice and carry on his great legacy” — one that has been far more moderate than Mr. Trump’s. Mr. Trump has been hitting the road in recent weeks to support Republican candidates, especially those targeting sitting Democrats. Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, faces a challenge from Representative Kevin Cramer, a Republican. North Dakota is the fourth state the president has visited in the past week. Until Wednesday, Mr. Trump had faced weeks of turmoil over his administration’s immigration policies. But Justice Kennedy’s decision to retire seemed to give him extra firepower, and he said he wanted to pick a jurist who could spend at least 40 years on the court. “You know,” Mr. Trump said, “so many elements go into the making of a great justice of the Supreme Court. Heidi will vote no to any pick we make.” Ms. Heitkamp, one of the most endangered Democrats in the chamber, has been sharply criticized by Republicans here. A particular sticking point was her decision to high-five Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, after voting against a 20-week ban on abortions. "
530,"If the last few days hadn’t been dispiriting enough for those who believed the Supreme Court could still stand for reproductive freedom, equal rights for all Americans, a check on presidential power, a more humane criminal justice system and so much more, Wednesday afternoon brought the coup de grâce. Everyone knew it was coming sooner than later, but Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement, which he announced in a letter released hours after the court had issued its final rulings of the term, is still crushing. It sends a stark message to the tens of millions of Americans who have long turned to the court for the vindication of many of their most cherished rights and protections: Look somewhere else. That place is the ballot box. So show up and vote. In the absence of a Supreme Court majority that will reliably protect human dignity, universal equality and women’s right to control their own bodies, it is up to Americans who cherish these values to elect politicians at every level of government who share them. Justice Kennedy, who was nominated to the court by President Ronald Reagan and confirmed in 1988, defended these values, however imperfectly. He was the last in a line of Republican-appointed justices who moderated some of the reactionary tendencies on the court, which has now had a majority of Republican appointees for nearly half a century. All of those justices were confirmed in the days before ultraconservative activists hijacked the nomination process and ensured that only faithful right-wing ideologues would get a nod. With Justice Kennedy’s departure, the court is very likely to lock in an unmoderated, hard-right majority for the rest of most of our lives. It is a dark moment in the history of the court and the nation, and it’s about to get a lot darker. Once President Trump names his second pick and the Senate confirms that person, you can forget about new or enhanced protections for gays and lesbians, or saving the last shreds of affirmative action at public universities. Longstanding precedents are now at extreme risk. Foremost among these is a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion under Roe v. Wade, which was preserved solely on the strength of Justice Kennedy’s vote. Meanwhile, count on more rulings that, like Monday’s decision upholding racial gerrymandering in Texas, give states the green light to cut back on voting rights, promote the rights of corporations over individuals, further erode the wall between church and state and look the other way when states cut corners and evade constitutional requirements in order to execute their citizens. "
531,"An immigration lawyer said she fractured her foot after being pushed to the ground by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer as she followed her client, a 3-year-old boy, into an ICE building in Kansas City, Mo. The lawyer, Andrea Martinez, said that she and a colleague were trying to accompany the child, Noah Bautista-Mayorga, into the ICE office around 3 a.m. Tuesday. Noah’s mother, Kenia Bautista-Mayorga, had been detained since May. The family had entered the country illegally in February 2016 and was to be deported to Honduras on Tuesday morning. Ms. Martinez said that she and the other lawyer were pushed forcefully by the ICE officer as he tried to block her from entering the building. The encounter was captured on a widely circulated video, which shows a brief scuffle between the two lawyers and an ICE officer, with Ms. Martinez tumbling to the ground after she approaches the door to the building. “I’m traumatized,” Ms. Martinez said Wednesday. “As attorneys, we expect ourselves to be strong for our clients. When you get physically battered by an ICE officer, it also takes a toll emotionally; we’ve been in shock and in tears.” She declined to say whether she had filed a complaint with ICE. In an emailed statement on Wednesday, an ICE official said that the agency took “allegations against ICE personnel very seriously” and that it was “looking into the matter.” The official declined to comment further until the agency completed a review of the evidence. "
532,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court dealt a major blow on Wednesday to organized labor. By a 5-to-4 vote, with the more conservative justices in the majority, the court ruled that government workers who choose not to join unions may not be required to help pay for collective bargaining. Forcing those workers to finance union activity violated the First Amendment, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote for the majority. “We conclude that this arrangement violates the free speech rights of nonmembers by compelling them to subsidize private speech on matters of substantial public concern,” he wrote. The ruling means that public-sector unions across the nation, already under political pressure, could lose tens of millions of dollars and see their effectiveness diminished. “We recognize that the loss of payments from nonmembers may cause unions to experience unpleasant transition costs in the short term, and may require unions to make adjustments in order to attract and retain members,” Justice Alito wrote. “But we must weigh these disadvantages against the considerable windfall that unions have received” over the years. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Neil M. Gorsuch joined the majority opinion, which overruled a four-decade-old precedent. Justice Elena Kagan summarized her dissent from the bench, a sign of profound disagreement. “There is no sugarcoating today’s opinion,” she wrote. “The majority overthrows a decision entrenched in this nation’s law — and in its economic life — for over 40 years.” "
533,"It’s not just the kids at the border. America systematically shortchanges tens of millions of children, including homegrown kids. The upshot is that American kids are more likely to be poor, to drop out of high school and even to die young than in other advanced countries. We tear apart homegrown families, too, through mass incarceration, excessive juvenile detention and overuse of foster care. One black child in 10 spends time in foster care — and 61,000 foster kids have simply gone missing since 2000. Like immigration, the mistreatment of children is an old problem that President Trump is exacerbating. Here’s a rule of thumb in America for any shortage of resources or conflict over priorities: Kids get screwed. “A shockingly high number of children in the U.S. live in poverty,” the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, declared in a scathing report. Almost one-fifth of American children live in poverty, he noted, and they account for more than one-fifth of homeless people. Alston told me that “there’s a very direct link” between the mistreatment of immigrant children at the border and the indifference toward low-income children all across the country. The core reason, he suggested, is a lack of compassion. Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, protested the U.N. report, saying, “It is patently ridiculous for the United Nations to examine poverty in America.” "
534,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A crucial Supreme Court justice is retiring, Poland weakens its Holocaust law and Germany is stunned in the World Cup. Here’s the latest: • Big news from the Supreme Court. Justice Anthony Kennedy, above center, announced his retirement, setting up a furious fight over the highest American court’s future. Justice Kennedy, 81, was the swing vote in many close cases, and his departure gives President Trump a chance to move the court rightward for generations. (Here is Mr. Trump’s list of potential nominees.) The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, promised a vote on a successor by the fall, and Democrats will have little power to stop it. On the same day, the court dealt a blow to organized labor, ruling that government workers who choose not to join unions cannot be required to help pay for collective bargaining. _____ • “The divisions go beyond trade.” That was Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, warning the Continent’s leaders to prepare for darker times because of President Trump’s trade and migration policies, which he described as “anti-liberal.” Adding to the Europeans’ concerns is a planned summit meeting between Mr. Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Above, Mr. Putin meeting with John Bolton, the U.S. national security adviser, in Moscow on Wednesday. "
535,"Donald Trump, a lying, bullying, womanizing autocrat-idolizer, is fundamentally transforming America in very real and lasting ways, in ways that have left decent people slack-jawed, enraged and exasperated. He has overtaken and destroyed the structure of the Republican Party, unleashing its ugliest elements to chant his praise and stroke his ego like drunken apostates dancing around a golden calf. He has attacked American institutions that seek truth and justice, like the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the press, because he wants to weaken America’s faith in truth and facts themselves. He has shunned and denigrated America’s traditional allies and cozied up to America’s traditional enemies, in one of the most bewildering presidential postures the country may ever have seen. And now, with the retirement of the Supreme Court moderate Anthony Kennedy, Trump will be able to solidify the court’s conservative majority for a generation. Elections have consequences. Not voting has consequences. Falling for Russian propaganda has consequences. Voter suppression has consequences. Taking the absolutely ridiculous position that there would be little difference between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump has consequences. "
536,"Washington — Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s announcement on Wednesday that he would retire this summer immediately thrust the high court to the center of the battle for control of the Senate, with Republicans daring red-state Democrats to oppose the nominee to replace Justice Kennedy, and Democrats warning that a rush to seat a new justice before the election would further galvanize moderate and liberal voters. With the Republican majority already on a 51-49 knife’s edge, senators and strategists from both parties said the clash over the balance of the Supreme Court would immediately overwhelm a campaign that to date had largely revolved around President Trump’s conduct and issues surrounding the economy, immigration and health care. The summer and fall will be consumed by the fight over Mr. Trump’s proposed replacement, and inject a new set of high-stakes issues into the campaign, primarily the prospect of overturning Roe v. Wade, as well as gay rights, voting rights and the rights of workers. “You’re looking at the likelihood of a young, radical and persuasive voice on the court who would leave an imprint for a generation,” said Senator Christopher Murphy of Connecticut, a Democrat. "
537,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has decided not to impose new investment restrictions on China, and will instead support a congressional effort to expand the powers of an existing federal body that reviews foreign investments in the United States for national security threats. The president is supporting a bipartisan bill, known as the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, which would broaden the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius. The legislation would give Cfius more power to investigate — and potentially block — foreign transactions. The House passed a version of the bill on Tuesday night, and the Senate passed its version this month. The bills now must be reconciled between the two congressional bodies before a final version lands on Mr. Trump’s desk. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said an expansion of Cfius would be a powerful national security and economic tool “that better protects the crown jewels of American technology and intellectual property from transfers and acquisitions that threaten our national security — and future economic prosperity.” Here is what an expanded Cfius (pronounced SIFF-ee-yus) would look like: The current committee — led by the Treasury secretary and made up of members of the State, Defense, Justice, Commerce, Energy and Homeland Security Departments — investigates only when a foreign company’s attempt to acquire or merge with an American company poses a national security risk. "
538,"WASHINGTON — Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s decision to retire, giving President Trump another opportunity to carry out his vow to select Supreme Court nominees who would “automatically” overturn Roe v. Wade, threatens to imperil the 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to have an abortion. The move also promised to reshuffle the landscape for reproductive rights in the United States, setting the stage for a bitter political and legal struggle that could affect generations of women. For decades, Justice Kennedy has been seen by supporters and opponents of abortion rights as a crucial swing vote, the deciding force on a profoundly polarized court who weighed in at key moments to preserve the core of Roe. “Kennedy was the firewall for abortion rights for as long as he was there,” said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the Florida State University College of Law who has written extensively on Roe and its aftermath. “He has been the defining force in American abortion law since the ’90s, so his absence means that Roe will be much more in peril.” “A decision overturning Roe is way more likely,” Ms. Ziegler said. “A series of decisions hollowing out Roe without formally announcing that’s what’s going on is pretty likely, too.” Activist groups on both sides of the issue agreed on one thing: that Justice Kennedy’s impending departure and Mr. Trump’s likely selection to succeed him would redraw the well-established legal battle lines over abortion rights, making it more probable that the court would move to uphold new restrictions and, potentially, abandon Roe altogether. "
539,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s time in office has been tumultuous, his term dogged by the special counsel investigation, his major legislative achievements few and his political prospects clouded by the chances of a Democratic Party midterm wave. But no matter what else happens in the Trump presidency, the retirement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the Supreme Court’s swing voter, set up Mr. Trump to cement a lasting legacy. Given a second Supreme Court vacancy to fill, he appears likely to go down in American history as an unusually influential president. As the first Republican president to get his judicial nominees confirmed by a simple majority vote, thanks to the abolition of the Senate filibuster rule, Mr. Trump has already broken records in appointing young and highly conservative appellate judges. Now, Mr. Trump can create a new majority bloc on the Supreme Court — one that is far more consistently conservative, and one that can impose its influence over American life long after his presidency ends on issues as diverse as the environment and labor or abortion and civil rights. If Mr. Trump secures that prospect, he will fulfill the deal that he struck during the 2016 campaign with traditional and movement conservatives who were skeptical of his politics and hesitant about supporting his candidacy. They feared he would pick an idiosyncratic nominee, like a celebrity lawyer he saw on television, rather than an authentic conservative. But Mr. Trump shored up Republican turnout in the election by promising to select Supreme Court nominations from a list of conservative judges. It was shaped by his top legal adviser, Donald F. McGahn II, now the White House counsel, who worked with advisers like Leonard Leo, the executive vice president of the Federalist Society, the conservative legal movement network. Court-focused voters helped deliver Mr. Trump’s narrow victory over Hillary Clinton, exit polls showed. Mr. Trump picked from his list to fulfill his first vacancy last year, choosing Neil M. Gorsuch to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, a staunch conservative. Since then, debates among conservatives about his unruly presidency have been characterized by a joking shorthand for what traditional Republicans got in return: “But Gorsuch.” In November, the White House quietly issued a revised version of the list in case another vacancy arose. "
540,"WASHINGTON — The stunning defeat on Tuesday of Representative Joseph Crowley, the fourth-ranking House Democrat and a potential future speaker, threw the future of the septuagenarian-led caucus into chaos, opening the door to a new generation of leadership and a push leftward. As shock in the capital over Mr. Crowley’s New York primary loss to a 28-year-old first-time candidate, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, gave way to calculation, House Democrats began floating challengers to Representative Nancy Pelosi, their leader. The current leadership slate reacted defensively to the threat of a purge, while a handful of other lawmakers braced for their own primary challenges from the left. Ms. Pelosi dismissed questions about the growing appetite in her ranks for new leaders, and the demand from the party base for more liberal representatives. “Well, I’m female, I’m progressive — what’s your problem?” she said. “Two out of three ain’t bad.” But rank-and-file House Democrats made clear in dozens of interviews that whether the party takes back the majority or not in November, there would be a push to depose Ms. Pelosi, the 78-year-old former speaker. “There will be an insurgency; I just don’t know who’s leading it,” said Representative Emanuel Cleaver II of Missouri. “But I can assure you that I am as certain of that as I am that today is Wednesday.” The question of who would lead an insurgency offered Ms. Pelosi some reassurance, but it also raised the threat of the unknown. For over a year, she has known that Mr. Crowley or Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, her 79-year-old second in command and longtime rival, would be her most obvious challengers. Both are white men with roots in the more centrist wing of the party. "
541,"Mark Mazzetti, an investigative reporter and editor in The New York Times’s Washington bureau, was part of a team that won a Pulitzer Prize earlier this year for reporting on Donald Trump’s advisers and their connections to Russia. Mr. Mazzetti recently reflected on his work at the Investigative Reporters and Editors conference in Orlando, Fla. This is an edited excerpt from his presentation.  We spent the last year investigating the president, and that was not really something we specifically set out to do. After the election, we had a group that was formed to look at how Trump was going to change government — Washington. We already knew it was going to be this unusual, unorthodox administration, so we built a team that was designed to look at a broad canvas and sort of spend some time on stories and go in the directions we wanted. Then Russia happened. All of a sudden, our focus changed, our group changed slightly, and we realized pretty quickly that this story was consequential, highly competitive, and it would probably be an investigation unlike we had done before. A lot of times, you go into an investigation and you know the broad contours of what you’re looking at — where you think you want to look. Not that you know the conclusions, but you know roughly the places to go. In this Trump-Russia-Mueller investigation, there was really no map or a sense of where things might end up, or even if there was anything at the bottom of the story. That was sort of in our heads, and still is in our heads, about how to be careful about what we write, to never go too far or assume too much. We came into this environment where the president said that everything we wrote, not just The New York Times but our competitors, was fake news and that we made up everything from whole cloth. So it was this frustrating and maddening — but at times exhilarating — and a hugely satisfying story; and we learned some things along the way. The last year was actually my first year as an actual editor — I was an editor and a reporter — but I learned a lot of things the hard way of being an editor. These were some of the things that I learned. If You Hit A Dry Hole, Stop Drilling We had people sending us tips on any number of things, and we had to look at them, and we had the Steele dossier, which still had not become public, at the same time. So in the beginning stage, it was: What do we look at? We don’t even know what this thing is. Where do we devote resources? We looked in a lot of different places. I think we found, and some of us learned the hard way, that you have to be ruthless if something is not producing or doesn’t seem immediately productive. Cut it off, at least for the time being. "
542,"WASHINGTON — Justice Anthony M. Kennedy has served for more than 30 years under two chief justices: William H. Rehnquist and John G. Roberts Jr. Courts are by tradition named for the chief justice. Since 2005, it has been the Roberts court. But if influence were the deciding factor, it would be more accurate to speak of the period since 1988 as the Kennedy court. Justice Kennedy has occupied a place at the court’s ideological center for his entire tenure, though he shared the middle ground with Justice Sandra Day O’Connor for most of his first two decades. On her retirement in 2006, his vote became the undisputed crucial one in most of the court’s closely divided cases. There have been about 51 decisions in which Justice Kennedy joined a liberal majority in a closely divided case, while Chief Justice Roberts dissented. All of those precedents could be in jeopardy, said Lee Epstein, a law professor and political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. To be sure, Justice Kennedy often voted with the court’s conservatives. He wrote the majority opinion in Citizens United, which allowed unlimited campaign spending by corporations and unions, and he joined the majority in Bush v. Gore, which handed the 2000 presidential election to George W. Bush. Justice Kennedy also voted with the court’s conservatives in cases on the Second Amendment and voting rights. Not infrequently, though, he joined the court’s liberal wing in important cases on contested social issues, including liberal decisions on gay rights, abortion, affirmative action and the death penalty. A court containing two Trump appointees could chip away at those rulings. "
543,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo promised on Wednesday to impose additional sanctions on Venezuela, predicted that the United States would again fund schools for Palestinian refugees in Jordan and said that President Trump viewed Russia’s return to the Group of 7 as inevitable. Mr. Pompeo’s remarks came during a hearing in the Senate that was intended to discuss his department’s budget. But there was little said about the Trump administration’s plans to slash the State Department’s funding, and Mr. Pompeo did not try to defend proposals to cut spending on such things as the battle against H.I.V. and AIDS in Africa. “It did happen before my time,” Mr. Pompeo said of the administration’s budget request for next year. “The president has lots of things to consider.” The hearing, before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, yielded a more muted, and even respectful, discussion than what Mr. Pompeo had with lawmakers in May, a month after he took over the State Department. But Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, displayed a poster on Wednesday showing dozens of comments by Mr. Trump that had insulted global allies and partners. And Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, asked pointed questions about what was achieved at the recent summit meeting in Singapore between Mr. Trump and Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader. Instead of talking about money during the hearing, Mr. Pompeo and the senators discussed a host of global challenges, including North Korea’s nuclear program, the civil war in Syria and Europe’s growing disenchantment with Mr. Trump. "
544,"Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a frequent swing vote on the Supreme Court, announced on Wednesday that he would retire this summer. Within hours, Democrats declared that the Senate should not consider his replacement until after the November midterm elections, citing what they called a precedent that Mr. McConnell set two years ago. In February 2016, the sudden death of the conservative Justice Antonin Scalia created a vacancy on the nation’s highest court. President Barack Obama nominated Merrick B. Garland, a centrist judge, to fill it. But Mr. McConnell insisted that the Senate should not consider the nomination during a presidential election — and that the next president, not Mr. Obama, should pick Justice Scalia’s replacement. That spring, Mr. McConnell repeatedly cited a nonexistent Senate “tradition” of not considering Supreme Court nominees during a president’s last year in office. “The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,” Mr. McConnell said in a statement released the night Justice Scalia died.   “All we are doing is following the longstanding tradition of not fulfilling a nomination in the middle of a presidential year,” he said in a March 2016 interview with Fox News Sunday. Mr. McConnell’s claim then of keeping to tradition was incorrect, given that the Senate has rejected a Supreme Court nominee one other time in an outgoing president’s final months in  modern history. And Democrats have a point in noting now that the crux of Mr. McConnell’s argument — to give voters a say in the process — could also apply to the midterm elections since senators must confirm Supreme Court nominations. Still, it is clear from statements, news conferences, interviews and in speeches on the Senate floor, Mr. McConnell consistently and specifically said that “the presidential election process” — and not “a lame-duck president” — should decide the next Supreme Court justice. He did not explicitly set a precedent for refusing to consider court nominees in all election years, as Democrats say now. "
545,"D.A. King, the head of an Atlanta-area group that opposes illegal immigration, heard word of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s retirement while vacationing on St. Simons Island, off the Georgia coast. He was elated thinking of the conservative who might replace him. Kristen Clarke, a civil rights lawyer, heard the news on the radio not far from the Supreme Court itself, as she was driving to a Capitol Hill hearing about the Voting Rights Act. She figured her job defending voting rights was about to become much more of a challenge. In West Hollywood, Curtis Collins was working out at Barry’s Bootcamp, and he said the Supreme Court justice’s announcement dominated the Wednesday afternoon conversation among the predominantly gay group of men exercising there. “Everybody was talking about it, how appalling it was,” he said. “Everyone was saying they were scared. We don’t normally talk about politics in there.” And in North Carolina, as the news of the impending retirement flashed on Amy Mahle’s phone, she wondered whether God might soon answer her prayers — and let her finally see the high court overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case establishing a constitutional right to abortion. “I think it’s possible,” she said. “I would love that.” It is not exactly shocking when an 81-year-old man decides to retire after 30 years on the job. And yet, Justice Kennedy’s announcement this week still managed to deliver a powerful jolt to the nation. His departure comes at a fragile time for the country, as a first-term president has vigorously assumed the role of disrupter-in-chief. President Trump said he wanted to pick a jurist who could serve at least 40 years on the court, potentially cementing the president’s impact on the country for generations. "
546,"MOSCOW — President Trump plans to meet President Vladimir V. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, on July 16 for one-on-one talks, the White House said on Thursday, a politically delicate meeting that will take place while the special counsel continues to investigate the Trump campaign’s possible ties to Russia. It will be the first formal summit meeting for Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin, who have spoken together twice on the sidelines of annual gatherings of world leaders, and it will come at a particularly critical moment, with midterm elections looming in the United States. “The two leaders will discuss relations between the United States and Russia, and a range of national security issues,” the White House said in a statement. The Helsinki talks, which will come on the heels of a NATO summit meeting in Brussels on July 11 and 12, could exacerbate American relations with European allies even as it eases tensions with Russia. Mr. Trump this week sent his national security adviser, John R. Bolton, to Moscow, where he met on Wednesday with Mr. Putin. Afterward, an aide to Mr. Putin, Yuri Ushakov, reiterated Moscow’s denial that it tried to influence the United States presidential election in 2016, comments that Mr. Trump cited on Thursday in a Twitter post before the meeting with Mr. Putin was announced. “Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election!” Mr. Trump wrote. The potential for such a high-level meeting has concerned some American allies in Europe, particularly because of recent tensions between the Trump administration and traditional American allies including Canada, France and Germany. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that it was important to get along with Russia and other countries. But a meeting with Mr. Putin, and improving the relationship between the United States and Russia, have long appeared to be priorities for Mr. Trump. Early in the presidential campaign, before having secured the Republican nomination, Mr. Trump said he thought he and Mr. Putin would hit it off. “I think I’d get along very well with Vladimir Putin,” Mr. Trump said in the summer of 2015. Mr. Trump has also said he would consider inviting Mr. Putin to the White House, which would be the first visit by the Russian leader since 2005. "
547,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Anthony Kennedy’s retirement is “the most consequential event in American jurisprudence at least since Bush v. Gore in 2000 and probably since Roe v. Wade in 1973,” writes Jack Goldsmith, a legal scholar and former George W. Bush administration official, in The Washington Post. Kennedy was quite conservative on many issues, including business regulation and campaign finance, and on those issues, his departure will have little immediate effect. Conservative positions will continue to win a lot of 5-4 decisions, as they did in the court term that ended this week. But Kennedy was moderate to liberal on other issues, including several that particularly affect the rights of women and minorities. On these issues, his departure could quickly lead to big changes in American life. In the simplest terms, the Supreme Court is likely to begin siding more often with those who already have power — and against those who don’t have much. After decades of rising economic inequality and consolidation, it is a profoundly worrisome development. You’ve probably already read a lot of discussion of Kennedy’s retirement. So I want to use today’s newsletter to cut through the noise and attempt to provide clarity on a few major questions: Can the Democrats prevent Kennedy’s replacement from being seated before the midterm election? Almost certainly not. "
548,"SEOUL, South Korea — Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis started Thursday morning ensconced in meetings with high-ranking Chinese military officials in Beijing, navigating a thin line between relationship-building and military posturing. By the afternoon he was standing beside his South Korean counterpart in Seoul, reaffirming a commitment to one of the United States’ closest allies amid moves to halt North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. The meetings come as military officials in Seoul and Washington wrestle how to follow this month’s talks in Singapore between the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Trump. Hopes of an enduring peace between the two Koreas remain riddled with suspicion of Mr. Kim’s sincerity about dismantling a decades-old nuclear program that has long been a hallmark of his family’s dynasty. During his brief visit to Seoul, the South’s capital, Mr. Mattis said that the United States would maintain current troop levels in South Korea and offered assurances that the two nations’ alliance was still “ironclad” despite the recent cancellation of a massive joint military exercise. That surprise concession came during the Trump-Kim talks and left future military training in limbo in the hopes of helping advance North Korea’s denuclearization. “The U.S. will continue to use the full range of diplomatic and military capabilities to uphold this commitment,” Mr. Mattis said of the alliance with South Korea before his roughly hourlong meeting with Defense Minister Song Young-moo. “The recent decision to suspend the Freedom Guardian exercise creates increased opportunity for our diplomats to negotiate, increasing prospects for a peaceful solution on the Korean Peninsula,” Mr. Mattis said. Freedom Guardian typically involves about 70,000 American and South Korean troops. Critics of the suspension of annual drills worry that military readiness on the peninsula could ultimately decline if many future opportunities for joint training are lost. Still, rifts between South Korean and American troops would probably take months — if not years — to appear. With more than 28,000 American troops stationed in the South, Mr. Mattis said that both nations’ forces “remained united, vigilant and ready to defend against any challenge.” Another consequence of the Trump-Kim summit meeting is that preparations are being made to transfer the remains of American service members left in North Korea after fighting in the Korean War stopped in the early 1950s. The transfers would satisfy a pledge by Mr. Kim as a sign of newfound good will toward Washington. Mr. Mattis is to head next to Japan, where he will meet with defense officials. They are likely to discuss many of the same issues that were at the forefront of his earlier stops in China and South Korea, including the Chinese military buildup in nearby waters and North Korean denuclearization. "
549,"Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s decision to retire gives President Trump the opportunity to create a solid five-member conservative majority on the Supreme Court — something that Republicans have sought for decades. Although Justice Kennedy, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, reliably voted with the court’s conservative justices on gun rights and voting rights, he often sided with liberals on gay rights, abortion, affirmative action and the death penalty. The timing of his resignation — just months before the midterm elections — makes the nomination of his replacement a potent rallying point for both parties. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, quickly promised a Senate vote by the fall. Here’s what we can expect in the coming months. President Trump had previously released a list of names he was considering for Supreme Court nominations, and he said on Wednesday that he would draw from this list. Stephen Wermiel, a constitutional law professor at American University, said the White House would have to move quickly to get someone confirmed before the court’s next term begins on Oct. 1. But he said that the White House had “undoubtedly” been reviewing potential nominees to prepare for this moment, and that the administration might have even asked some candidates to begin compiling information for background checks.

550,"Good Thursday. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Justice Anthony Kennedy announced yesterday that he’s retiring this summer, setting off a political war over the future of the Supreme Court. As a result, companies can probably expect business-related cases to go their way for at least a generation. Many of the court’s biggest cases in recent years were decided by a 5-4 majority. Justice Kennedy often provided the deciding vote. Whoever President Trump picks to replace him — here’s a list of candidates — will almost certainly push the court to the right. For a taste of what may come, consider yesterday’s 5-4 ruling on labor unions. The majority found that government workers who don’t join a union can’t be required to pay for collective bargaining. Groups tied to Republican billionaires have already pledged to capitalize with anti-union campaigns. The bottom line: Expect the business community to enjoy more wins in cases involving antitrust, privacy and more. You’ve probably heard that blockchain is a technology that is going to change the world — it is the backbone of Bitcoin, the now infamous cryptocurrency. You might even have heard someone trying to explain it by describing it as a “trusted distributed ledger.” "

552,"Arriving in Beijing last month, I knew I would not be able to connect to Google, Facebook or Uber. As strange as it was to go without these staples of online life in the West, it was even stranger to find that local Chinese didn’t seem to feel deprived at all. They search through Baidu, get their social media fix on WeChat, hail rides on Didi, curate news through sites like Toutiao. And while they know Beijing is watching, they accept this surveillance as normal. The Chinese government has carved out an alternative internet universe with its own brands, rules and culture, in which privacy doesn’t exist. But its real ambition is to break out of this parallel universe and dominate not just the internet but the technology industry worldwide. To contain Beijing, the United States and its allies are fighting back with a campaign of technoprotectionism, opening a perilous new front in the global trade battles. President Trump is the unlikely leader of the fight against Chinese tech dominance. Widely seen as a champion of rust belt industries, he recently slapped heavy tariffs on all the leading aluminum and steel exporters, drawing fierce protests not only from China but also from American allies like Germany and Canada. But steel is a side show compared with the emerging tech battle with China. Technology will decide which country emerges as the world’s dominant economic power in the long run. While about 20 percent of per-capita gross domestic product growth is driven by labor and capital, the remaining 80 percent is determined by how rapidly an economy is developing and applying new technology to increase production. China’s ambition to catch up to Western living standards thus depends largely on how rapidly it can match or surpass Western technology. Even allies miffed by Mr. Trump’s steel tariffs remained largely supportive when he imposed $50 billion in tariffs on China — and only China — in response to its predatory tech trade practices, then threatened another $200 billion if Beijing followed through on a promise to retaliate. This week, Mr. Trump endorsed intensified  review of Chinese investment in American technology and of American tech exports to China. Mr. Trump is both accelerating and expanding trade battles that began before he took office. Following the global financial crisis of 2008, countries around the world began to restrict cross-border flows of trade, capital and migrants. Globalization’s champions predicted that borders would continue to fall in at least one area — digital tech and the internet — but China has shown that a determined government can build walls in the virtual sphere, too. "
553,"It is hardly news that President Trump has deliberately provoked liberal outrage, as a candidate and as president. But in case anyone is still wondering whether his inflammatory language is the result of design or impulse, recent comments from current and former White House strategists are revealing. Last month, an unabashed Stephen Miller, Trump’s ever-calculating White House aide, described this tactic to the Atlantic as “constructive controversy — with the purpose of enlightenment.” “Our thing is to throw gasoline on the resistance,” Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to Trump, told Vanity Fair last December. “I love it. When they talk about identity politics, they’re playing into our hands.” Trump and his allies are capitalizing on a decades-long fight over immigration policy that they believe will galvanize more voters on the right than on the left, generating sufficient enthusiasm among Trump’s supporters to counter an energized Democratic electorate. The unpleasant reality is that a number of recent analyses based on psychological, sociological and political research provide a logical basis for the incendiary Trump-Miller-Bannon strategy. While Trump told reporters in January, “I am the least racist person you have ever interviewed,” he and his loyalists believe that they will thrive on repeated charges from the left that he and those who vote for him are racist. Those charges — perhaps paradoxically — serve to intensify the resentment of conservatives and Republicans toward liberals. Trump’s rhetoric — migrants “infest” and “invade our country” — is intended not only to intensify the anti-immigrant views of his supporters, but also to encourage liberals and Democrats to accuse him and his supporters of bigotry. Trump’s tactics are based on the conviction of many of his voters that opposition to immigration is not a form of racism. They deeply resent being called racist for anti-immigrant views they consider patriotic and, indeed, principled. "
554,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • For 30 years, Justice Anthony Kennedy has occupied a spot in the middle of the court’s ideological spectrum, often providing the deciding vote in closely divided cases. While he lent support to liberal views on gay rights, abortion and the death penalty, he sided with conservatives on voter access, gun control measures and campaign spending by corporations. The 81-year-old justice announced his retirement on Wednesday. Here’s our lead article about the news, and an assessment of Justice Kennedy’s influence by our Supreme Court reporter. We also looked at how the justice has voted over three decades. He doesn’t like being called the court’s swing vote: “The cases swing,” he said in 2015. “I don’t.” • Separately on Wednesday, the court dealt a major blow to organized labor, ruling that government workers who choose not to join unions may not be required to help pay for collective bargaining. "
555,"Faith in courts runs deep in the American liberal imagination. Remembering Brown v. Board of Education, Roe v. Wade and the recent marriage-equality decisions, we keep hoping that wise and fair-minded judges will protect the vulnerable and lead the country toward justice. Recent decisions upholding President Trump’s travel ban and Texas’ racially skewed voting districts are body blows to this optimism. They are unhappy reminders that for much of American history, the Supreme Court has been a deeply conservative institution, preserving racial hierarchy and the prerogatives of employers. When it comes to economic inequality, today’s Supreme Court is not only failing to help but is also aggressively making itself part of the problem in a time when inequality and insecurity are damaging the country and endangering our democracy. Under Chief Justice John Roberts, the court has consistently issued bold, partisan decisions that have been terrible for working people. Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, decided on Wednesday, was one of them. Just hours after that decision, Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement. With this “swing” vote gone, Chief Justice Roberts is now likely to take even more control over the direction of issues related to economic inequality — a direction that is earning him a legacy as chief justice of bosses, not workers. In Janus, the Supreme Court ruled that public-sector unions may not charge nonmembers “agency fees” for contract negotiation and other services that affect all employees in the same workplace, members and nonmembers alike. In his opinion for the court, Justice Samuel Alito compared the fees to Orwellian ideological browbeating. Invoking the great First Amendment tradition invalidating loyalty oaths and mandatory pledges of allegiance, he warned, “Forcing free and independent individuals to endorse ideas they find objectionable is always demeaning.” "
556,"EL PASO — In Texas, officials near Austin terminated a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain dozens of migrant mothers who had been arrested and separated from their children. In California, Sacramento County ended a multimillion-dollar deal with ICE to keep immigrants jailed while awaiting hearings. The City Council of Springfield in western Oregon voted unanimously to end yet another contract with ICE for housing immigrants in the municipal jail. And in Alexandria, Virginia, authorities put an end to a deal allowing ICE to house immigrant children in a juvenile detention center. Local governments around the United States are starting to sever lucrative ties with federal immigration entities amid growing discomfort with the Trump administration’s immigration policies. Fueled largely by alarm over the separation of migrant children from their parents, the cancellations suggest an attempt to disengage from federal policies seen as harmful to immigrant families — even when those policies could be pouring millions of dollars into local government budgets. “It just felt inherently unjust for Sacramento to make money from dealing with ICE,” said Phil Serna, a Sacramento County supervisor who joined two colleagues in canceling the contract. “For me, it came down to an administration that is extremely hostile to immigrants. I didn’t feel we should be part of that.” The local debates over what to do with ICE facilities come at a time when federal immigration policies are disrupting local politics. Insurgent Democratic candidates on the left who are winning primaries, such as Deb Haaland in New Mexico and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York, have made defunding or abolishing ICE a central feature of their campaign platforms. "
557,"White supremacist groups are increasingly using propaganda like fliers and posters to spread bigoted messages on college campuses, a new report by the Anti-Defamation League found. In the past academic year, 292 such incidents were reported — a 77 percent increase from the previous year, according to the report, which was released on Thursday. The stickers, banners and other physical materials included racist and anti-Semitic messages and often targeted Muslims, nonwhite immigrants and L.G.B.T. people. Spreading propaganda across college campuses has become a popular tactic for white supremacist groups in recent years, said Oren Segal, the director of the A.D.L.’s Center on Extremism. “They’re trying to engage with what they hope are future members of their organizations, followers of their ideology,” he said in an interview. “They have put a premium on winning hearts and minds.” As part of this strategy, white supremacist groups try to expand their reach by encouraging anyone with internet access to download the materials and spread their messages, he said. In recent years, members of the far right — including white supremacists and neo-Nazis — have made themselves increasingly visible at events like a rally in Charlottesville, Va., last year that turned deadly when a man drove a car into a crowd of counterprotesters. "
558,"Almost everyone worth knowing has been canceled by someone. Bill Gates is canceled. Gwen Stefani and Erykah Badu are canceled. Despite his relatively strong play in the World Cup, Cristiano Ronaldo has been canceled. Taylor Swift is canceled and Common is canceled and, Wednesday, Antoni Porowski, a “Queer Eye” fan favorite was also canceled.  Needless to say, Kanye West is canceled, too. Also canceled: concepts! 2018 is “officially, extremely canceled,” and so is love. And, inevitably, saying something “is canceled” is also canceled. In these cases, the word refers to total disinvestment in something (anything), and this usage can be traced back several years. But in the last few months, it’s been everywhere. The most popular definition of the concept on Urban Dictionary was posted in March and four of the nine definitions listed were added in just the last two years. There’s a hierarchy to being canceled: Celebrities who say things many people find unacceptable, like Kanye, who suggested slavery was a choice, or Shania Twain, who said she would have voted for President Trump were she not a Canadian person, have been canceled en masse. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Kanye fretted extensively about being canceled, using some form of the word seven separate times. “I’m canceled. I’m canceled because I didn’t cancel Trump,” he said. But not all cancellations are the result of transgressing fans’ expectations. Sometimes they happen for no stated reason. All it takes for someone to be canceled is for someone else to announce, via social media, that they are. And so even the seemingly blameless — Yara Shahidi, Rowan Blanchard, Chris Evans, etc. — have been canceled. Lena Waithe is one of few celebrities who thus far seems to have avoided cancellation, but perhaps it is imminent. "
559,"SEATTLE — Amazon has more than 100 warehouses. It has a fleet of trucks, and even its own airplanes. Now, in another effort to help get its millions of packages to shoppers faster, it wants to build an army of delivery people, too. The company announced Thursday a new program aimed at helping people start their own businesses delivering packages for Amazon. For a minimum investment of $10,000, people in the United States will be able to open and manage their own delivery service handling Amazon packages. Although the couriers will not be employees of the company, they’ll get access to Amazon-branded vehicles, uniforms and more. By the company’s calculations, an owner could earn as much as $300,000 a year in profit by operating a fleet of up to 40 vehicles. The program is a potential solution to a growing problem Amazon faces as it handles an ever-increasing number of packages for customers all across the country: How to quickly get packages from its various package-sorting centers to people’s doorsteps. But the start-up service is certain to raise questions about whether it could challenge — or even replace — some of the work currently done by Amazon’s partners, including United Parcel Service and the United States Postal Service. "
560,"EL PASO — To hear it from the White House, America’s southern border is a war zone. Things look a lot different up close. Here in El Paso, local governments collaborate closely with federal agencies in the United States and Mexico to ensure that our ports of entry — bridges connecting the two countries — can effectively and safely move more than 10 million people and $90 billion in trade back and forth each year. Our ports are critical to our local, state and national economies, and they stand as proof that international cooperation can make the border work for both countries. Never did any of us imagine that the area around one of them, the Marcelino Serna Port at Tornillo, would someday be the site of the United States’s first tent city for detained immigrant children, or that it would bring us together to protest the separation of refugee families. Maybe we should have seen it coming. Fearmongering about immigrants has long hinged on the notion that the border is a porous, lawless place — even though it is as safe and secure as ever. For many of us in El Paso, the international ebb and flow of people is part of daily life and our location is a source of pride. In the 16th Congressional District, where I am running for a seat in the House, immigrants make up a quarter of our population; in 2014 alone, they paid over $983 million in taxes and provided $3.1 billion in spending power. But even as El Pasoans and our southern neighbors have built up a vibrant economy, politicians from Washington and other places far from the border have made our region the centerpiece of their efforts to restrict immigration. This idea first surfaced in El Paso in 1993, when the head of the local Border Patrol office proposed building a border wall, inspiring protests and heated local debates. El Pasoans defeated the idea soon after it was introduced, but after that, national conversations about immigration reform became increasingly linked with tightly restricted border flows, making it nearly impossible for humane immigration reform to make it through Congress.

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. On “Late Night,” Seth Meyers made a vain attempt on Wednesday to persuade Justice Anthony M. Kennedy to stay on the Supreme Court. After Kennedy announced his plans to retire — providing President Trump a second opportunity to shape the court’s future — Meyers said being on the court was almost like being retired anyway. Stephen Colbert and Meyers were both excited to talk about Mitt Romney, who is back in the news after winning the Republican Senate nomination in Utah on Tuesday. But honestly, they weren’t that excited. Jenny Hagel, a writer for “Late Night,” delivered a message to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic Socialist who just ousted one of the most powerful Democrats in Congress. Or was the message actually for Seth Meyers? Colbert went back to the confessional. Ocasio-Cortez went from relatively unknown to the national stage in a single night. She will talk to Colbert on Thursday. At 51, is Benicio Del Toro entering a new chapter in his career? "
562,"WASHINGTON — A political war over replacing  Justice Anthony M. Kennedy roared to life on Thursday in Washington, the start of an election-season clash over a Supreme Court retirement that will reshape the country’s judicial future. Hours after Justice Kennedy’s announcement on Wednesday that he will step down July 31, conservative organizations were mobilizing to support the Republican-controlled Senate in a quick confirmation of a justice who would be expected to vote against the court’s liberal precedents. One group, the Judicial Crisis Network, has already started a $1 million ad campaign urging people to support the president’s choice. Democrats and liberal advocacy organizations face enormous challenges if they hope to prevent President Trump and the Republicans from installing a conservative justice who would shift the ideological balance of the court for  generations. Mr. Trump has promised to pick from a list of highly conservative jurists, and Republicans control the Senate, which can confirm the president’s choice by a simple majority. Mr. Trump began wooing senators late Thursday night, meeting at the White House separately with three Republicans and with the three Democrats — Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia — who broke party ranks last year and voted to confirm Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, the president’s first Supreme Court pick. After the meeting, Ms. Heitkamp said in a statement that she urged the president to appoint someone who is “pragmatic, fair, compassionate, committed to justice, and above politics.” But the effect of Justice Kennedy’s departure has already ignited opposition from many Democratic lawmakers, party strategists and liberal activists, who vowed a fierce battle to try to preserve decades of liberal court precedents on abortion, civil rights, gay rights, affirmative action and the death penalty. "
563,"Harley-Davidson, the famed manufacturer of “hogs” — big motorcycles — made headlines this week when it announced that it would be moving some of its production out of the U.S. in the face of the growing tariff war between America and the European Union. And Donald Trump made more headlines when he lashed out at a company “I’ve been very good to,” accusing of having “surrendered” to Europe. So he threatened it with punishment: “They will be taxed like never before.” Now, in general I’m suspicious of news analyses, especially but not only in economics, that rely a lot on a supposedly revealing anecdote (such as, for example, analyses based on conversations with Trump supporters in diners). And the truth is that while Harley-Davidson may be something of an icon, it isn’t a big player in the U.S. economy. At the end of last year its motorcycle segment employed around 5,000 workers; that’s not much in an economy where around 250,000 people are hired every working day. Nonetheless, I think the Harley story is one of those anecdotes that tells us a lot. It’s an early example of the incentives created by the looming Trumpian trade war, which will hurt many more American companies and workers than Trump or the people around him seem to realize. It’s an indication of the hysterical reactions we can expect from the Trump crew as the downsides of their policies start to become apparent — hysteria that other countries will surely see as evidence of Trump’s fundamental weakness. And what Trump’s alleged experts have to say about the controversy offers fresh confirmation that nobody in the administration has the slightest idea what he or she is doing. About that trade war: So far, we’re seeing only initial skirmishes in something that may well become much bigger. Nonetheless, what’s already happened isn’t trivial. The U.S. has imposed significant tariffs on steel and aluminum, causing their domestic prices to shoot up; our trading partners, especially the European Union, have announced plans to retaliate with tariffs on selected U.S. products.

__________ Now is supposed to be a good time to be a bank. The largest lenders in the United States are enjoying ballooning profits. The Trump administration has removed rules on banks, and more deregulation is likely to come. The economy is in one of its strongest patches since the financial crisis, and the Federal Reserve is raising rates. But it would be hard to tell all that by looking at their share prices over the last two weeks. Though it was up on Thursday, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials Index had fallen for 13 straight trading days and was off 5.9 percent over that period. The KBW Bank Index was down the same percentage. Shares of Morgan Stanley had declined 9.1 percent from June 8 through Wednesday’s close, JPMorgan Chase was down 7.1 percent and Goldman was off 5.7 percent. So why are bank stocks struggling? A flattening yield curve. [The yield curve is perilously close to predicting a recession. Read more about it.] Over the last several years, bank shares have moved with interest rate expectations. When investors believe rates will climb, shares of banks rise as well, and vice versa. The reason for that is simple. Banks are typically more profitable in a rising rate environment, and after years of historically low rates crimping the bottom lines of banks, investors cheered any signs that rates would move higher. But it’s currently a bit more complicated than that. The yield curve — basically the difference between interest rates on short-term United States government bonds and long-term government bonds — is often considered a good proxy for the profitability on bank lending. Usually, long-term interest rates are higher than short-term ones. Because banks borrow at the short end and lend at the long end, the greater the difference between the two, the more profitable bank lending can be. But the yield curve is currently flattening. The spread between two-year and 10-year United States Treasury notes is at its narrowest level in more than a decade. And that could bite into the margins of banks. "
565,"If you’ve been spending the past few days pondering some Supreme Court-related historical what-if’s, then try this one on for size. Thurgood Marshall, the court’s first African-American justice, announced his retirement on June 27, 1991. That was, of course, smack in the middle of a Republican presidency — that of George H. W. Bush. Mr. Bush, a one-term president, had already made one appointment to the court, David Souter, so Justice Marshall’s retirement was — and indeed was seen as — a gift to the president. He was in his 80s, and he felt increasingly isolated on the court, but it’s also the case that politically, Supreme Court succession wasn’t a life-or-death matter in those days. In our time, Justice Marshall would surely have held on, hoping for the possibility of a Democrat winning the presidency in 1992. And as we know, that happened. Bill Clinton won. And here’s where fate’s heavy hand figures in: Mr. Marshall died on Jan. 24, 1993 — Bill Clinton’s third full day as president. Had Justice Marshall stuck by his original intention not to retire, Mr. Clinton would have delivered his funeral oration and replaced him. Clarence Thomas would never have been on the court, and we presumably would have had a 5-4 liberal majority rather than a conservative one all these years. No Citizens United, no Hobby Lobby decision, none of the bleak outcomes we’ve been battered with in these past few days. Wednesday afternoon, shortly after Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced his retirement, the Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer took to the Senate floor to announce that “this is the most important Supreme Court vacancy for this country in at least a generation.” After what the Republicans did to Barack Obama’s nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, in 2016, he argued, they should hew to their own precedent and wait to vote on a nominee until after the midterm elections; to do otherwise was “the height of hypocrisy.” Of course, the difference between 2016 and now is that then, the Republicans controlled the Senate and were able to deny Judge Garland a hearing and vote, whereas today, the Democrats are in the minority and lack such power. There isn’t much they can do, everyone says. "
566,"As the November midterm elections approach, we invited Times readers to ask our politics editor, Patrick Healy, about our current political coverage and our plans for the 2020 presidential race. We quickly heard from more than 200 readers. Here is a selection of the questions we received, which have been condensed and lightly edited for clarity, and Patrick’s responses. Please share any additional questions or suggestions for our Politics team in the comments. The Times coverage of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez before her surprise defeat of Joe Crowley was limited to a few paragraphs in articles about multiple candidates and a cameo in a prescient editorial warning the incumbent not to take his seat for granted. I’d like to hear from someone on the local politics/midterms team about the decision not to cover her more, their understanding of shifting demographics and whether they need to adjust the way they think about/approach nontraditional candidates. — Staci D. Kramer Hi, Staci. Thanks for the question. As you noted, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s defeat of Joe Crowley, the fourth-ranking House Democrat and a potential future speaker, was a surprise. Our heavy, competing demands for coverage make it impossible to do all the stories we want to do, including all the ones we see and all the ones that we don’t see clearly because of the surprise factor. I’m proud of the pieces we did do about Ms. Ocasio-Cortez — she was the lead figure in a Page 1 story about the surge in female candidates and a main figure in a long Metro piece about challengers last week. We have 13 reporters on the Politics desk, and we are making coverage choices among many hundreds of candidates and so many states, districts and issues. We also have critical stories to do about voters and their lives. We tend to look for themes, issues and developments that echo across multiple races, trying to draw connections for readers. That’s what we tried to do with the two stories that I cited involving Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. "
567,"President Trump’s pick to lead the Internal Revenue Service, Charles Rettig, said on Thursday that he would make it a priority to run the department without bias, an attempt to ease lawmakers’ concerns that the tax collection agency could be weaponized for political purposes. The I.R.S. has been a political punching bag for several years following allegations during the Obama administration that it was unfairly targeting conservative groups seeking nonprofit status. Now, Democrats are fearful that the agency could interpret the new $1.5 billion tax law in ways that disadvantage blue states and that it could be used by Mr. Trump to target companies that act against his wishes. “If I am confirmed, I will be in charge of the Internal Revenue Service and will make sure that the Internal Revenue Service moves forward, follows the law in an impartial, non-biased manner,” Mr. Rettig said. Mr. Rettig, whose confirmation appears likely, faces a huge challenge at the helm of the I.R.S. The department has been starved of funding for years and is struggling with aging technology and a depleted work force. The agency’s online filing system crashed on Tax Day this year, a failure that many said stemmed from budget cuts that have resulted in antiquated technology. He will also be tasked with implementing the tax legislation that Congress passed late last year. The law is the biggest tax overhaul in three decades, and the I.R.S. has been scrambling to issue new guidance and interpretations for businesses and taxpayers who are still coming to grips with the changes. A longtime tax lawyer who has specialized in defending individuals and entities fighting the tax agency in court, Mr. Rettig will also be facing a big management challenge. He said at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee that he has never managed a team of more than 35 people. The I.R.S. employs around 70,000. "
568,"WASHINGTON — The State Department warned in a report on Thursday that separating children from their parents can cause lasting psychological damage that leaves them vulnerable to trafficking, a cautionary tale that comes amid an uproar over a Trump administration immigration policy that has temporarily broken up migrant families as they enter the United States. “Children in institutional care, including government-run facilities, can be easy targets for traffickers,” the department’s annual Trafficking in Persons report concluded. It added: “Even at their best, residential institutions are unable to meet a child’s need for emotional support that is typically received from family members or consistent caretakers with whom the child can develop an attachment.” Since May, the Trump administration has separated more than 2,300 migrant children from families crossing the southwestern border. The children are placed in shelters and other temporary housing for up to 20 days while their adult parents or other relatives are held in federal custody during their immigration proceedings. President Trump has demanded that Congress reverse the policy, but did so himself last week with an executive order. He initially defended the shelters for young migrants as a safeguard against what he called a “massive child smuggling trade.” “Can you believe this? In this day and age, we’re talking about child smuggling,” Mr. Trump said last week in a speech to the National Federation of Independent Businesses. “We’re talking about women smuggling in this day and age. The worst it’s been in history because the internet has led to this.” "
569,"On the day that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez accomplished her remarkable victory in the Democratic primary for New York’s 14th Congressional District seat, beating Joseph Crowley, the longtime incumbent, a new book arrived, as if by cosmic fiat, to help explain the emerging realignments of the political order. “Squeezed: Why Our Families Can’t Afford America” examines the deteriorating fortunes of the middle-class — the teachers who sustain themselves with second jobs as Uber drivers; the young adjunct professors on food stamps; the unemployed 50-year-olds with few prospects; the junior lawyers far from the Wall Street partner track, carrying heavy student debt, whose work is already being automated. In the book, Alissa Quart illustrates how life in a once-secure stratum has come to resemble the endlessly anxious existence of those in the rungs below. Bolstering the argument, as it happens, is new data from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, released this week, indicating that in three counties in the San Francisco Bay Area, where housing costs are famously astronomical, families earning $117,000 a year would now qualify as low-income, making them eligible for subsidized housing. If you live in a place where a master’s degree won’t permit you a lifestyle that looks much different from an office clerk’s — if, in fact, it means you moonlight in a cubicle doing something you despise and eating lentils for dinner in the Rubbermaid TakeAlongs you brought from home — it follows that you will be less likely to think of yourself as a member of the privileged elite to which you have been told you belong and more inclined to find affinity with the broadening numbers of the more obviously oppressed, and vote accordingly. This dynamic played a crucial role in three Democratic primaries in and around the city. In the Second Congressional District, which encompasses parts of Long Island’s South Shore, Liuba Grechen Shirley, a young mother and consultant to nonprofit organizations who has never held political office, easily beat DuWayne Gregory, a county legislator who had the backing of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s specious Women’s Equality Party even though DuWayne Gregory is not female, either by birth or choice. The women’s party’s support was even more ludicrous given that Ms. Grechen Shirley, after petitioning the Federal Election Commission, used some of her campaign funds to cover child-care costs incurred during the race, a move that signaled just how intimately she understands the economic stresses of raising children even in what would appear to be comfortable circumstance. "
570,"MENLO PARK, Calif. — Social media companies, stepping up efforts to stop disinformation on their online platforms ahead of this year’s midterm elections, unveiled on Thursday new tools aimed at improving transparency around advertisements. In simultaneous announcements, Facebook and Twitter said they were broadening efforts around public, searchable archives of ads that run on their sites. Twitter, which has begun requiring that anyone running a campaign ad go through a verification process, said Thursday that it was introducing an Ads Transparency Center, which allows the public to view a database of any ad run on the platform. Facebook, which made a database of political ads public last month, announced on Thursday that it intended to make it easier to see background details — such as the buyer — of all ads running across Facebook and its various platforms, including Instagram and Messenger. Each Facebook page will now have a tab called “Info and Ads.” Clicking on that tab will reveal every ad a page runs, as well as details about the page itself, including when it was founded and any name changes. "
571,"Investigators with the Department of Homeland Security made an unannounced visit on Wednesday to the home of a former Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman who abruptly resigned three months ago because he could not bring himself to lie on behalf of the Trump administration. The former spokesman, James Schwab, announced his resignation from the agency on March 12. He said he quit because he did not want “to perpetuate misleading facts” during a dispute between the Justice Department and the mayor of Oakland, Calif. Mr. Schwab had stayed quiet since then, until he sat down on Wednesday for an interview with a CBS News reporter at his California home. But two men in dark suits interrupted the interview, which aired on Thursday morning, knocking on Mr. Schwab’s front door. They said they worked in the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General’s office and wanted to speak with Mr. Schwab. One of them refused to answer questions from the reporter, Jamie Yuccas, who stood by Mr. Schwab at the front door. “I’m talking to him,” the agent told her. “This is confidential.” Later, Mr. Schwab told the reporter that the agents had wanted to discuss the department’s investigation into how the Oakland mayor, Libby Schaaf, found out in February about a raid by federal immigration officers before it took place. Ms. Schaaf issued a public warning about the impending raid, angering Justice Department officials. "
572,"LOS ANGELES — The actor George Takei, who was 5 years old when he was sent with his family to a camp in Arkansas, was rehearsing for a role when his husband interrupted him with some news this week from the Supreme Court. It could have been a ruling to celebrate: the court had finally overturned the 1944 decision that the United States government could force more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent into internment camps. But for Mr. Takei and many of those who spent months or years in the camps, the ruling on Tuesday felt more like a hollow victory. As pleased as they were that the court at last recognized what history has long regarded as a grave mistake, they lamented that it came as part of the decision that upheld President Trump’s ban on travel into the United States by citizens of several predominantly Muslim countries. There are too many striking parallels, they said, between their treatment and the logic to justify keeping people out of the country. Mr. Takei read the opinion of Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote that “the forcible relocation of U.S. citizens to concentration camps, solely and explicitly on the basis of race, is objectively unlawful and outside the scope of presidential authority.” Chief Justice Roberts pushed back against what Justice Sonia Sotomayor called “stark parallels” between the 1944 decision and the majority opinion this week. He added, “Korematsu was gravely wrong the day it was decided, has been overruled in the court of history, and — to be clear — ‘has no place in law under the Constitution.’” "
573,"SHANGHAI — Months of struggling with economic problems at home and bickering with President Trump over trade are starting to take their toll on China’s financial health. China’s stock market has now fallen close to levels not seen since a crash shocked global investors three years ago. An elite Chinese think tank affiliated with the government warned this week that the chances of a financial panic had risen significantly, shaking markets even more. Chinese officials are trying to help factories deal with American tariffs by weakening the value of the country’s currency. That makes Chinese goods more competitive abroad, but it also gives investors inside and outside China a reason to take their money out of the country. And it offers Mr. Trump an opportunity to criticize Beijing — in the past, he has railed against the country for weakening its currency. The chances of a financial collapse that could shake the world are slim. The Chinese government has vast sums of money it can tap in the event of a crisis. And there are steep financial barriers to keep money from fleeing the country. While investors have ways around the barriers, they limit the possibility that such a flight could bring one of the world’s most important growth engines to a halt. Nevertheless, China faces some increasingly serious economic challenges. It is trying to tackle its considerable debt problems without starving its economy of the money that keeps growth chugging along. The president’s tariffs so far have been quite small in the grand scheme of things, but they add to China’s troubles. The next wave of tariffs, set at 25 percent, threatens to cover at least a tenth of China’s exports to the United States, and more could follow. "
574,"It’s been an active week, politically speaking — they all are, these days — and with the Fourth of July around the corner, politics are front and center in our recommended titles. From Terrance Hayes, there’s a poetry collection sparked by Donald Trump’s election; from Ben Rhodes, a memoir of his time as a key adviser in the Obama White House; and from Stephen Greenblatt, a pointed consideration of the political leaders in Shakespeare’s plays that might call to mind, reassuringly or not, the opening lines of Sonnet 59: “If there be nothing new, but that which is / Hath been before …” Gregory Cowles
Senior Editor, Books WE BEGIN OUR ASCENT, by Joe Mungo Reed. (Simon & Schuster, $26.) Reed’s debut novel is about a 29-year-old man, Sol, who is a professional cyclist in the Tour de France. He’s not the star of his team, nor does he particularly care to be. He’s a stoic, someone who doesn’t crave notoriety. The book also includes a portrait of Sol’s marriage, and an investigation into the complicated costs of victory. “It’s one of the indices of Reed’s talent that you hotly flip this book’s pages even when there’s not a lot going on, when it’s just another hilly day on the tour,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. AMERICAN SONNETS FOR MY PAST AND FUTURE ASSASSIN, by Terrance Hayes. (Penguin Poets, $18.) In his latest book, Hayes, the recipient of a MacArthur “genius” grant in 2014, sets himself the challenge of writing political poems in the guise of love poems. “Something happens everywhere in this country,” Hayes writes. “Every day. Someone is praying, someone is prey.” Our critic Parul Sehgal writes: “Any real accounting of the art emerging from our own current terrors would be premature,” but Hayes’s book “has a claim to be among the first fully-fledged works to reckon with the presidency of Donald Trump — and one of the most surprising.” OLD IN ART SCHOOL: A Memoir of Starting Over, by Nell Painter. (Counterpoint, $26.) At the age of 64, Painter, the noted historian who wrote “The History of White People” and many other books, decided to leave a chaired professorship at Princeton to go to art school. She writes about her embrace of a new field and a new life in this memoir. Our critic Jennifer Szalai calls it a “candid and cheerfully irreverent” book. “One of the most enjoyable aspects of ‘Old in Art School’ is seeing her relax her historian’s grip on social meaning and open up to new ways of seeing.” [Our Summer Reading issue has 73 great suggestions for thrillers, romance, true crime and more.] ATTICUS FINCH: The Biography, by Joseph Crespino. (Basic Books, $27.) Through his biography of the much-loved fictional character from Harper Lee’s “To Kill a Mockingbird,” Crespino brings to life the inconsistencies of the South and of Lee’s father, who was the model for the real Atticus. “This book opens a window into ‘Mockingbird’s’ scrubbed-up Alabama of memory,” Howell Raines writes in his review, “into the literary politics of the modern South, and into the argument that existed in Lee’s imagination when she arrived at 19 on the University of Alabama’s campus in 1945 and when she died in a Monroeville nursing home in 2016.” BEARSKIN, by James A. McLaughlin. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $26.99.) Terrible things are happening to black bears in this debut mystery set in western Virginia. And the humans facing off against the novel’s ex-con hero, now charged with protecting a wilderness preserve, are just as terrible. “McLaughlin writes about the natural world with casual lyricism and un-self-conscious joy, while describing physical violence so vividly you want to look away,” Marilyn Stasio writes in her crime column. And he is “just as remarkable when he turns to other subjects.” "
575,"A former aide to Roger J. Stone Jr., the longtime Trump adviser and self-described “dirty trickster,” was subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury hearing evidence in the Russia investigation and to hand over documents, and his lawyer moved on Thursday to quash it in court. The aide, Andrew Miller, has not been mentioned before publicly in the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Miller, a registered Libertarian, worked briefly for Mr. Stone around the time of the Republican National Convention in 2016, helping to arrange media interviews and conducting other tasks, according to a person close to Mr. Stone. Mr. Miller was also an aide on the campaign for New York governor in 2010 of Kristin M. Davis, a former madam, whose main adviser was Mr. Stone. A lawyer, Paul Kamenar, said he filed a motion on Thursday on behalf of a client who was subpoenaed to be questioned in front of the grand jury, though he did not identify Mr. Miller. Mr. Kamenar said the National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative nonprofit organization, was paying for his services. His motion argued that Mr. Mueller’s appointment “was unconstitutional,” he said. Peter Flaherty, the chairman of the policy center, said, “The founders feared exactly what we see in Mueller: a runaway federal official. We hope to see Mueller’s operation disbanded, once and for all.” Though that argument has gained prominence in conservative circles, two federal judges have rejected it, including this week in the financial fraud case against Paul Manafort, the president’s former campaign chairman. The deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, who appointed Mr. Mueller, has also repeatedly said he has seen nothing untoward in Mr. Mueller’s conduct. Mr. Miller’s scheduled grand jury appearance was postponed after the motion was filed. Mr. Stone has become a focal point for Mr. Mueller’s investigators in the inquiry into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia’s election interference. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Stone publicly foreshadowed the released by WikiLeaks of information damaging to Hillary Clinton’s campaign. He has since said that he was informed by an intermediary about the plans of the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, and has denied allegations that he helped collude with foreign powers. "
576,"In 30 years on the Supreme Court — the past 13 as the swing justice — Justice Anthony Kennedy has been the decisive vote in cases on issues ranging from abortion to affirmative action. Yet his legacy will be defined primarily by his opinions in the area of gay rights, where he wrote the major majority opinions expansively reading the Constitution to protect gay Americans. Even though these cases have prompted some to call Justice Kennedy the “first gay justice,” his legacy remains unsettled and uncertain. His gay-rights decisions will now face a hostile majority on the court, which is likely to overturn, cut back or nullify at least some of them. And he has made it surprisingly easy. When Justice Kennedy joined the court in 1988, it was no friend to gays and lesbians. Two years earlier, the court had upheld a Georgia law making it a crime to engage in intimate conduct with a person of the same sex. It dismissed the argument that the Constitution protected gay intimacy as “facetious at best.” Gay and lesbian citizens found a champion in Justice Kennedy. In 1996, he led the court in overturning a Colorado law barring cities from protecting gays and lesbians from discrimination. Justice Kennedy wrote that laws targeting gay people based in “animus” were unconstitutional. In 2003, he wrote for the court in Lawrence v. Texas, invalidating a law criminalizing same-sex sodomy and overturning the dismissive 1986 decision. Justice Kennedy also wrote the court’s two most important decisions on same-sex marriage. The court in 2013 struck down a provision of the Defense of Marriage Act denying federal benefits to gay couples married under state law; Mr. Kennedy wrote that same-sex marriages were “worthy of dignity in the community equal with all other marriages.” In Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 decision declaring a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, Justice Kennedy said these relationships were “central to individual dignity and autonomy.” The 5-4 decision made marriage equality the law of the land, but beyond that Justice Kennedy’s opinions were important for giving legitimacy to the love and relationships of people long shamed for those very feelings of intimacy. "
577,"On a recent Wednesday afternoon, the singer and songwriter John Legend was at the Soho House in Malibu, Calif., his jean-jacketed back to the Pacific Ocean, his left hand around a glass of rosé that he helped create. He was ruminating about the global uptick in wine consumption — the millennial’s alcoholic beverage of choice, according to studies and articles galore. “Wine has a kind of connection to luxury, and if you can make it in a price range that’s available to a lot of people, they want to access it,” said Mr. Legend, who is 39 (more of a Gen X-er). He paused to consider the salmon-colored varietal swishing around his glass, which was created with Jean-Charles Boisset, costs $25 per bottle and was made with grapes grown in the South of France, on a vineyard a few miles from the Mediterranean. “It was a big coup for us to get the grapes that we got from that area,” Mr. Legend said. The rosé is the fourth wine he and Mr. Boisset have produced together under the LVE label, which stands for Legend Vineyard Exclusive. (The name “was always kind of suggestive of love, even though it doesn’t spell it out explicitly,” said Mr. Legend, born John Stephens.) It is also far from the only famous person’s rosé on the market. Drew Barrymore has one. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie (their split notwithstanding) too. “Typically we say no to any celebrity client,” said Mr. Boisset, who wears his blond hair in suave waves and also dabbles in making jewelry. “Typically, they’re not as intensely into wine, not as dedicated to wine and winemaking.” "
578,"WASHINGTON — For months, their sparring had been indirect, stern letters exchanged, pointed threats traded through the news media. But on Thursday, the ever-intensifying skirmishes between Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein and conservative House Republicans broke into an ugly public fight. On the House floor, Republicans voted in lock step to give the Justice Department seven days to produce sensitive documents related to the Russia inquiry and the F.B.I.’s investigation of Hillary Clinton’s private email use. Though nonbinding, the measure was intended to put Mr. Rosenstein on notice that House lawmakers were willing to take punitive action — potentially including impeachment — if their demands were not met. In the House Judiciary Committee, conservative Republicans hauled Mr. Rosenstein and the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, before television cameras to accuse them of hiding information from Congress to protect their own interests. In Mr. Rosenstein’s case, some Republicans charged outright misconduct related to the investigation into Russian election interference. The two leaders, both appointed by President Trump, defended the special counsel investigation and their response to congressional investigators, even as they said they had been deeply troubled by the findings of a Justice Department inspector general’s report released this month on the F.B.I.’s handling of the Clinton email case. “There are mechanisms to resolve this without threatening to hold people in contempt,” Mr. Rosenstein said, urging lawmakers to work with him rather than threaten him. “We are not in contempt of this Congress. We are not going to be.” Democrats accused Republicans of concocting a political distraction to further bloody the reputation of the Justice Department as it investigates President Trump and his campaign’s ties to Russia. Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Judiciary Committee Democrat, called the floor vote “clearly a pretext for a move against Mr. Rosenstein that the majority already has planned.” "
579,"It’s good for American presidents to meet with adversaries, to clarify differences and resolve disputes. But when President Trump sits down with President Vladimir Putin of Russia in Finland next month, it will be a meeting of kindred spirits, and that’s a problem. One would think that at a tête-à-tête with the Russian autocrat, the president of the United States would take on some of the major concerns of America and its closest allies. Say, for instance, Mr. Putin’s seizure of Crimea and attack on Ukraine, which led to punishing international sanctions. But at the Group of 7 meeting in Quebec this month, Mr. Trump reportedly told his fellow heads of state that Crimea is Russian because everyone there speaks that language. And, of course, Trump aides talked to Russian officials about lifting some sanctions even before he took office. One would hope that the president of the United States would let Mr. Putin know that he faces a united front of Mr. Trump and his fellow NATO leaders, with whom he would have met days before the summit in Helsinki. But Axios reported that during the meeting in Quebec, Mr. Trump said, “NATO is as bad as Nafta,” the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is one of Mr. Trump’s favorite boogeymen. Certainly the president would mention that even the people he appointed to run America’s intelligence services believe unequivocally that Mr. Putin interfered in the 2016 election to put him in office and is continuing to undermine American democracy. Right? But on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump tweeted, “Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election!” More likely, Mr. Trump will congratulate Mr. Putin, once again, for winning another term in a sham election, as he did in March, even though his aides explicitly warned him not to. And he has already proposed readmitting Russia to the Group of 7, from which it was ousted after the Ukraine invasion. Summits once tended to be carefully scripted, and presidents were attended by senior advisers and American interpreters. At dinner during a Group of 20 meeting last July, Mr. Trump walked over to Mr. Putin and had a casual conversation with no other American representative present. He later said they discussed adoptions — the same issue that he falsely claimed was the subject of a meeting at Trump Tower in 2016 between his representatives and Russian operatives who said they had dirt on Hillary Clinton. "
580,"ANNAPOLIS, Md. — A man armed with a shotgun and smoke grenades stormed into the newsroom of a community newspaper chain in Maryland’s capital on Thursday afternoon, killing five staff members, injuring two others and prompting law enforcement agencies across the country to provide protection at the headquarters of media organizations. The suspect, Jarrod W. Ramos, 38, was taken into custody at the scene and was charged on Friday morning with five counts of first-degree murder. He had a long history of conflict with the Capital Gazette, which produces a number of local newspapers along Maryland’s shore, suing journalists there for defamation and waging a social media campaign against them. “This was a targeted attack on the Capital Gazette,” said William Krampf, acting chief of the Anne Arundel County Police Department. “This person was prepared to shoot people. His intent was to cause harm.” A bail hearing for Mr. Ramos was scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Friday in Annapolis, according to Maryland court records, which did not list a lawyer for him but said Mr. Ramos was eligible to be represented by a public defender. [Annapolis gunman barricaded door in newsroom shooting, police say.] The chilling attack was covered in real time by some of the journalists who found themselves under siege. A message saying “please help us” with the address of the office building was tweeted from the account of Anthony Messenger, a summer intern. A crime reporter, Phil Davis, described how the gunman “shot through the glass door to the office” before opening fire on employees. "
581,"To the Editor: In your June 24 editorial, “The G.O.P. Built Donald Trump’s Cages,” you mention the big increase in migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, and say, “None of this is surprising considering the rampant violence in the region.” Indeed. What seems largely lost in current immigration discussions is that those countries have never recovered from brutal civil wars that our government abetted with vast amounts of aid and training to their armed forces and other combatants. To punish migrants for protecting their children from social violence seeded by American foreign policy ignores our own historical complicity in forcing their decision to leave their broken societies. Redirecting billions of tax dollars intended to secure our borders toward programs to stabilize these societies would not only fulfill our moral responsibility to repair the damage we have done but also give Central Americans reason to have hope for and remain in their homelands. RUTH J. CHOJNACKI, CHICAGO "
582,"The presidency of Donald Trump has stirred debate about what it means to be American. What ideals should the nation embody? What is the state of the country today? As we approach Independence Day, we are sharing some pieces that wrestled with these questions. Because America is an idea as much as a country, our acts of moral courage defend us as surely as any act of violence, writes Phil Klay, a former Marine who served in Iraq. “In the real world, as lived and experienced by real people, the demand for human rights and dignity, the longing for liberty and justice and opportunity, the hatred of oppression and corruption and cruelty is reality. By denying this experience, we deny the aspirations of billions of people, and invite their enduring resentment,” the Republican senator writes. "
583,"The legal problems facing Navient, one of the nation’s largest student loan debt collectors, mounted on Thursday as California’s attorney general said he would file a lawsuit accusing the company of widespread deceptions and mistakes that cost borrowers millions of dollars. The accusations echo those in a major enforcement case against Navient that was started by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, in the final days of President Obama’s administration. The bureau is still pursuing the case, but consumer advocates fear it will be dropped or settled by Mick Mulvaney, the bureau’s acting director, who has sharply reduced the agency’s powers and scrapped many of its lawsuits and investigations. The actions of Mr. Mulvaney, who is also President Trump’s budget director, have prompted states to more aggressively flex their own consumer protection authority. California would be the fourth and largest state to sue Navient, joining Illinois, Pennsylvania and Washington. States have sued over Navient’s handling of both private and federal student loans. The case in California focuses on the federal loans, which are made or backed by the government. Navient is among the largest of eight servicers hired by the government to collect $1.4 trillion owed by nearly 43 million people. The company services loans for 12 million borrowers, including an estimated 1.5 million in California, according to the attorney general’s office. The attorney general, Xavier Becerra, said he would file the lawsuit this week in state Superior Court. The complaint will focus on how Navient guided borrowers through their repayment options. The company failed to steer borrowers toward the best options available to them, raising the repayment costs for some, according to Mr. Becerra’s office, which said it believed that Navient broke state laws prohibiting unfair competition and false advertising. “Navient’s loan servicing abuses have compounded the misery of parents and students who sacrificed to pay for college,” Mr. Becerra said. "
584,"WASHINGTON — This truly will be a Supreme Court confirmation like none before. It will be the first for a court vacancy that opened during the Trump administration. It will be the first in an election year since President Barack Obama’s nominee was blocked by Republicans in 2016. Most importantly, it will be the first time the process has begun with the threat of a filibuster off the table. The latter fact means that President Trump’s nominee will begin the often challenging, tricky and exhausting process knowing that a seat on the Supreme Court can be won solely with Republican votes. But just because Democrats have very few options to derail an objectionable nominee does not mean they intend to wave the white flag before the battle has even begun. “The key is to not give up here,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat who serves on the Judiciary Committee. “We need to make the case to the American people about how the decisions that this court makes every day affect people’s lives. Look at the last decades: where you can go to school, who you can marry, how you can vote, if you can vote. Those are the kinds of decisions they make.” Democrats and their allies on Thursday were still absorbing the full implications of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s retirement announcement a day earlier and only beginning to map a strategy for contesting a confirmation in a reshaped Senate world. When Democrats attempted to filibuster the confirmation of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch in 2017, Republicans forced through a change in Senate procedure that eliminated the requirement that a nominee must win a supermajority of 60 votes before final approval. Republicans saw it as justified payback for a similar Democratic move in 2013 on lower court nominees. The Republican action was anticipated, but was no certainty at the start of the Gorsuch hearings. But simple majority approval for considering and confirming Supreme Court nominations is the standing policy of the Senate now. "

Journalists inside live-tweeted the attack, including the intern quoted above. A suspect was in custody and being interrogated, the county executive said. In New York City, the police deployed officers to protect news outlets. And newsrooms, including ours, waited for a clue as to the gunman’s motive. _____ 2.

Mr. Trump and Republican leaders have vowed to act quickly to fill the seat. (We look at some possible nominees.) "
586,"WASHINGTON — At least 19 Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigators are seeking to dissolve the agency, concerned that the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal migrants has limited their ability to pursue national security threats, child pornography and transnational crime. In a letter sent last week to Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, the special agents proposed creating a stand-alone investigations unit and another agency to handle immigration detention and deportation. The request was sent as a growing number of Democrats and immigration-rights advocates have called for eliminating ICE. Investigations “have been perceived as targeting undocumented aliens, instead of the transnational criminal organizations that facilitate cross border crimes impacting our communities and national security,” wrote the agents from Homeland Security Investigations, which is a branch of ICE. The Texas Observer first reported the letter. The investigators said local law enforcement officials have questioned the independence of their agency, given the Trump administration’s aggressive policies against illegal immigration — including arresting undocumented workers for minor offenses, such as driving without a license. At least two House Democrats — Representatives Mark Pocan of Wisconsin and Pramila Jayapal of Washington — are pushing to eliminate ICE. And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who stunned the Democratic establishment this week with her upstart primary victory against Representative Joe Crowley of New York, made abolishing ICE one of the key planks of her campaign. "
587,"A death in the family. A punch to the gut. The announcement of Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement felt to me and many people I know like both of those, but even more so like something else: a sick cosmic joke. How much power will a president with such tenuous claim to it get to wield? How profound and durable an impact will such a shallow and fickle person make? Donald Trump barely won the White House, under circumstances — a tainted opponent, three million fewer votes than she received, James Comey’s moral vanity and Russia’s amoral exertions — that raise serious questions about how many Americans yearned to see him there. But he’s virtually assured of appointing as many judges to the Supreme Court as each of his three predecessors did and could reshape Americans’ lives even more significantly. It’s the craziest dissonance. The cruelest, too. In his heart of hearts, he doesn’t give a damn about rolling back abortion rights. Any sane analysis of his background and sober read of his character leads to that conclusion. Yet this man of all men — a misogynist, a philanderer, a grabber-by-the-you-know-what — may be the end of Roe v. Wade. Time to spring into action, Ivanka! I type that in jest, knowing that my keystrokes are in vain. So many of Trump’s positions, not just on abortion but also on a whole lot else, were embraced late in the game, as matters of political convenience. They were his clearest path to power. Then they were his crudest way to flex it. "
588,"— President Trump, at an event in Mount Pleasant, Wis., on Thursday Two other Republican presidents won Wisconsin after Dwight D. Eisenhower twice swept the state in 1952 and 1956, and Mr. Trump took it in 2016. Richard M. Nixon first won Wisconsin in the 1960 presidential election, but lost the nationwide vote to John F. Kennedy. Nixon won Wisconsin again in 1968 and in 1972. A decade later, Ronald Reagan also won Wisconsin in 1980 and 1984. Mr. Trump often recalls his Electoral College wins in speeches, and previously has claimed to be the first Republican to win the Badger State in “many, many years” or “in decades.” Occasionally, he has specified the amount of time elapsed since a Republican last won Wisconsin. But the time frame has increased with each telling. In December 2016, he said it had been 38 years since a Republican candidate took the state; at a speech in South Carolina on Monday it was 44 years. On Thursday, Mr. Trump said he was the first Republican to win there in a half century. "
589,"President Trump mounted a case for electing more Republicans to Congress in November with misleading attacks on Democrats and exaggerated boasts of his achievements at a campaign rally in Fargo, N.D., on Wednesday night. He was in Fargo to stump for Representative Kevin Cramer, a Republican, who is trying to unseat the state’s Democratic senator, Heidi Heitkamp. During the speech, Mr. Trump warned that Ms. Heitkamp would vote against his nomination to replace Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who had announced his retirement from the Supreme Court on Wednesday. (Ms. Heitkamp voted for his previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil M. Gorsuch.) Mr. Trump also updated his familiar stump speech — and its repeated inaccuracies —  with a few new claims. Here’s a fact check. This month, the Trump administration announced a new rule that would allow small businesses to join together and set up association health plans. But Mr. Trump is counting his enrollees before the plans hatch. Under the rule, association plans will not be offered until at least Sept. 1, so it is impossible that “millions and millions” have already enrolled under the rule. The association plans may not have to provide “essential health benefits” that the Affordable Care Act requires for individual and small group market plans. These benefits include coverage for maternity care, mental health care and prescription drugs. As a result, the new plans could be cheaper and lure younger, healthier people away from Affordable Care Act marketplaces, driving up costs for those plans. "
590,"CHELSEA, Mass. — It was the day after a Latina community activist in New York toppled an entrenched congressman of her own party in one of the biggest political upsets of the decade. And the shock waves reverberated 200 miles away in Boston, where another woman of color who is challenging an entrenched incumbent was clearly buoyed by the surprising turn of events. Ayanna Pressley, a Boston city councilwoman, appearing at a candidate forum at a senior center Wednesday night, gave a brief, impassioned speech about economic inequality and concluded that she — “this woman!” — could be a disruptive force for change. The audience whooped and hollered in support. In an interview afterward, Ms. Pressley, her voice raspy from pollen in the air, said she was inspired by the stunning success of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Tuesday in a New York Democratic House primary. “What her victory has done is reaffirmed for us that there’s a path to victory, that this is winnable and that it’s going to come down to the field,” Ms. Pressley said, referring to how campaign workers get out the vote. Since Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s victory over longtime Queens Democrat Joseph Crowley, several other insurgent candidates have drawn inspiration from the success of her unapologetically progressive campaign — providing hope that they, too, could upend the Democratic establishment against all odds. This is especially true among women, who are running for Congress in record numbers this year. In Massachusetts, three women who are challenging longtime male House members said the results in New York have provided a jolt of confidence. "
591,"The Federal Reserve on Thursday gave clean bills of health to most of the largest American banks, allowing them to return money to shareholders, but it forced Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to freeze such payouts around last year’s levels. The Fed said that all of the nation’s very biggest banks — Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase — passed the second round of the central bank’s “stress tests,” which gauge whether financial institutions have enough capital and are sufficiently well-managed to continue lending during periods of financial upheaval. The tests were intended to gauge the health of 35 banks, and regulators said they would allow 34 of them to pay dividends and buy back their own shares, a boon for investors who have been eager to benefit from the banks’ record profits. The banks will almost certainly use their collective success to amplify their argument that, 10 years after the financial crisis, they do not need to be as tightly regulated, and that they deserve relief similar to what their much smaller peers received earlier this year when President Trump signed a bill easing parts of the Dodd-Frank law, the landmark bank oversight legislation enacted in 2010. The six largest American banks got permission to pay out a combined sum of more than $125 billions in the form of increased dividends, which reward investors for every share of stock they own, and share buybacks, which increase the value of a company’s stock by reducing the number of shares outstanding. The only bank to fail the stress test was the American arm of Germany’s Deutsche Bank, which Fed officials sharply criticized for “widespread and critical deficiencies” in how it handles its capital and manages its finances. The Fed’s grievances mean Deutsche Bank will be restricted from transferring money from the United States to its Frankfurt headquarters, potentially making its Wall Street operations less lucrative at a time when the bank’s top executives are already mulling cuts to that business.

593,"WASHINGTON — The retirement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy from the Supreme Court could significantly reshape environmental law in the decades ahead and potentially make it easier for the Trump administration to roll back Obama-era climate change policies in the coming years, legal experts said. In his 30 years on the court, Justice Kennedy was frequently a crucial swing vote on major environmental questions. While he tended to be skeptical of expansive federal regulations that intruded on private property rights, he was also willing to break with the court’s conservative wing in favor of more aggressive government action to limit air and water pollution. Perhaps most notably, in 2007, he sided with the court’s four liberal justices in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency to rule that the E.P.A. had the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. That case laid the groundwork for many of the Obama administration’s major climate policies, including the Clean Power Plan to cut emissions from coal-fired power plants. “One can comfortably say that he was the single most influential justice for environmental law over the past 30 years,” said Richard J. Lazarus, a law professor at Harvard. “Many of those cases were sharply divided, but the one constant was that Kennedy was in the majority in every single case but one. He was the justice that advocates always tried to persuade, because he was persuadable.” President Trump is widely expected to nominate a more conservative justice to fill the vacancy. If that nominee is confirmed by the Senate, he or she would give the court a five-seat conservative majority that is likely to take a dimmer view of federal environmental regulation. It is far from certain that a new court would quickly overturn Massachusetts v. E.P.A. and take away the government’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases altogether, legal experts said. The court has already upheld that ruling twice in subsequent cases, and, during oral arguments in 2014, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. indicated that he considered the case an established precedent. "

595,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Set to Tilt Court as Kennedy Retires” (front page, June 28): We have now had a day to grieve over the disaster that Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s retirement portends. A day is all we can afford. Now we must turn our attention to what we can do to prevent that disaster from materializing. Surely there are Republican senators, like Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, who are pro-choice, who do not want their legacy to include complicity in the reversal of reproductive rights, L.G.B.T.Q. rights, and other human and civil rights.

PETALUMA, CALIF. To the Editor: Re “Confirmation Fight Adds to Volatile Year” (On Washington column, June 28): Congratulations to Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, on successfully twisting use of the institution of the Senate to subvert rather than to uphold its official duties, the work his constituents elected him to carry out. He subverted the fulfillment of a president’s right to nominate a Supreme Court justice — President Barack Obama’s choice of Merrick B. Garland in 2016 — and have that nominee considered and voted on by the full Senate. He did this for his party’s political gain, so that its agenda could “win,” by any means necessary. Too bad the people have been hoodwinked by his end run, the Senate reduced to the wishes of a party hack, and the Supreme Court likewise tarnished. So much for representative democracy. "
596,"There is an unusual space in the basement of the University of Louisville library, in the large anteroom to the official archives for Senator Mitch McConnell. The space is called the Civic Education Gallery, but it is, essentially, a kind of shrine to the political career of Mr. McConnell, not unlike the exhibits on Babe Ruth or Hank Aaron you’d find at the Baseball Hall of Fame. The mere fact of the shrine is curious enough, given that it memorializes a politician who shows no sign of leaving the stage any time soon. What’s most unusual, though, is what it chooses to highlight. There are a few artifacts from Mr. McConnell’s youth — his baseball glove, his honorary fraternity paddle — but most of the exhibits are devoted to the elections Mr. McConnell won, starting with high school and on up through Jefferson County executive and the Senate. When I visited the room while researching my 2014 biography on Mr. McConnell, I was struck by what was missing: exhibits on actual governing accomplishments from the Senate majority leader’s four decades in elected office. That absence confirmed my thesis that Mr. McConnell, far more even than other politicians, was motivated by the game of politics — winning elections and rising in the leadership ranks, achieving power for power’s sake — more than by any lasting policy goals. Well, that was then. Four years later, it is becoming increasingly clear that Mitch McConnell is creating a legacy for himself, and it’s a mighty grand one. Mr. McConnell has created the world in which we are now living. Donald Trump dominates our universe — and now has the power to fill the second Supreme Court seat in two years. Mitch McConnell, who has promised a vote on whomever the president nominates “this fall,” is the figure who was quietly making it all possible, all along. First, there was Mr. McConnell’s vigorous defense, going back to the early 1990s, of the role of big money in American politics, which would help Mr. Trump not so much in terms of funding his campaign, but in helping shape the conditions for his appeal. "
597,"As a candidate, Donald Trump promised to appoint justices who would overrule Roe v. Wade, and the actions of his administration confirm his hostility. With Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s retirement, we are now at the moment of reckoning. The court of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. could reject Roe quickly and openly, allowing states to ban abortion at any point during pregnancy and to punish doctors and even their patients — as Mr. Trump discussed on the campaign trail. Some states like Iowa have already enacted laws banning early abortion to put test cases in the judicial pipeline. Of course, an overruling of this kind would send political shock waves through the country. It would assuredly mobilize voters. The justices may want to avoid this, so a reconstituted Roberts court may instead choose stealth and overrule Roe without openly acknowledging it was doing so. Already the court has allowed so many restrictions that Mississippi has only one remaining abortion clinic. With another Trump appointee, the court would most likely gut its current abortion standards and allow legislatures to enact restrictions that would make access to abortion practically impossible in hostile states. Stealth overruling would effectively produce the same result as an explicit overruling of Roe — with less political backlash. Today, 27 major cities are 100 miles or more from the nearest abortion provider, and we can expect these “abortion deserts” in the South and the Midwest to spread rapidly. It is not only abortion clinics that are at risk. It is not clear what constitutional protections, if any, a newly constituted Roberts court will provide a woman who needs to end a pregnancy to save her life or health. Nor is it clear that the court will limit the religious-conscience objections of health care providers whose refusals inflict harm on their patients and customers. Contraception and more is imperiled. A Walgreens pharmacist citing his ethical objections recently refused to give a woman medications she was prescribed for a miscarriage, provoking a storm of social-media protests about the impact of women’s health and dignity. In either world the burden of increased regulation would fall on poor women, on young women and on women in remote and rural settings who lack the means to travel to states where health care is more readily available. Given the current composition of the Senate, it is hard to imagine a confirmation process that might prevent the appointment of a justice who would vote for Roe’s overruling — in the way that Senate objections in 1987 blocked the confirmation of Judge Robert Bork, which ultimately led to Justice Kennedy’s promotion to the bench. "
598,"SAN FRANCISCO — Not too many years ago, I was having dinner with my in-laws in Orange County, Calif. My mother-in-law was complaining about her new neighbors, an all-too-common pastime for any resident of a gated community with an HOA. The neighbors’ crime? “They let their children play in our cul-de-sac,” she lamented. “Everyone knows streets are for cars.” “But Granny,” my daughter, then about 6, piped up, “streets are for people, not cars.” I smiled to myself and thought, my work here is done. While my daughter had pointed out something that seemed obvious to her, convincing her grandmother would be something else altogether. It’s no surprise that my city kid, now 12, who walks alone to the corner store, takes public transportation with her friends, carpools to school and has parents fortunate enough to both have 15-minute BART commutes, should be an advocate for the streets she interacts with so regularly. But she’s in the minority. In 1969, 48 percent of kids in kindergarten through eighth grade walked or biked to school; by 2009, that number had dropped to 13 percent. Most of us pass through the places where we live, work and play not on two feet or two wheels but in cars. We are disconnected from our streets — and so we don’t care about them. It shows. As Jane Jacobs observed in “The Death and Life of Great American Cities”: “The trust of a city street is formed over time from many, many little public sidewalk contacts. Most of it is ostensibly trivial but the sum is not trivial at all.” You don’t have any sidewalk contacts when the car is your default. And I think we’re seeing the very real effects of being a car-dependent nation, one that assumes its collective reliance on fossil fuel is not only sustainable but somehow an inalienable right. Our love affair with the car far supersedes our connection to the street, and by extension, our community. We need to counteract the maddeningly retrograde efforts of the Koch brothers to kill public transit projects across the country in the name of personal liberty. This disconnect, as Ms. Jacobs observed back in 1961, is not at all trivial. A nation ensconced in private vehicles is a nation too easily able to ignore the realities on its streets. How do we change that? In June, a series of pilot projects begun by the National Street Service — a project of Greenfield Labs, a mobility research arm of Ford’s — in partnership with Gehl, were completed. No question there are already a lot of terrific nonprofits and grass-roots efforts that have long been engaged in this effort. And there are numerous initiatives that run the gamut from (PARK)ing Day, now over a decade old, which turns parking spaces into temporary parks, to Reimagining the Civic Commons, which is working to demonstrate the power of the civic commons to produce increased and more equitably shared prosperity — and to establish metrics to analyze their impact.

599,"Ali Watkins, the New York Times reporter whose email and phone records were secretly seized by the Trump administration, will be transferred out of the newspaper’s Washington bureau and reassigned to a new beat in New York, The Times said on Tuesday. Ms. Watkins, 26, had been the subject of an internal review by The Times after revelations that she had a three-year affair with a high-ranking aide on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which she covered for several news organizations before joining The Times in December. The aide, James Wolfe, 57, who handled classified material for the committee, was arrested last month as part of a leak investigation in which the Justice Department also seized Ms. Watkins’s communications, an unusually aggressive move against a journalist that prompted an outcry from press advocates. Mr. Wolfe was charged with lying to the F.B.I. but not with leaking classified information; he has pleaded not guilty. [Read more about how Ms. Watkins’s relationship with Mr. Wolfe rattled the world of Washington journalists.] Ms. Watkins, who had been covering federal law enforcement at The Times, will be assigned a mentor and moved to a new beat in New York “for a fresh start,” the paper’s executive editor, Dean Baquet, wrote in a memo to the newsroom. “We hold our journalists and their work to the highest standards,” Mr. Baquet wrote. “We are giving Ali an opportunity to show that she can live up to them. I believe she can.” He added: “I also believe that The Times must be a humane place that can allow for second chances when there are mitigating circumstances.” "
600,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said Tuesday that it was abandoning Obama administration policies that called on universities to consider race as a factor in diversifying their campuses, signaling that the administration will champion race-blind admissions standards. In a joint letter, the Education and Justice Departments announced that they had rescinded seven Obama-era policy guidelines on affirmative action, which, the departments said, “advocate policy preferences and positions beyond the requirements of the Constitution.” “The executive branch cannot circumvent Congress or the courts by creating guidance that goes beyond the law and — in some instances — stays on the books for decades,” said Devin M. O’Malley, a Justice Department spokesman. Striking a softer tone, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos wrote in a separate statement: “The Supreme Court has determined what affirmative action policies are constitutional, and the court’s written decisions are the best guide for navigating this complex issue. Schools should continue to offer equal opportunities for all students while abiding by the law.” The Trump administration’s moves come with affirmative action at a crossroads. Hard-liners in the Justice and Education Departments are moving against any use of race as a measurement of diversity in education. And the retirement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy at the end of this month will leave the Supreme Court without its swing vote on affirmative action while allowing President Trump to nominate a justice opposed to policies that for decades have tried to integrate elite educational institutions. A highly anticipated case is pitting Harvard against Asian-American students who say one of the nation’s most prestigious institutions has systematically excluded some Asian-American applicants to maintain slots for students of other races. That case is clearly aimed at the Supreme Court. "
601,"Yeni González left her home in rural Guatemala in mid-May. Days later, she crossed the United States border, by night, with her three young children. They were picked up by Border Patrol, she said, and taken to a detention center near Yuma, Ariz.   At 5 one morning, agents woke the children there and took them away. Ms. González’s children  — Deyuin, Jamelin and Lester — are among more than 2,000 young migrants who were separated from their adult relatives under the Trump Administration’s “zero-tolerance” policy. Despite President Trump’s executive order ending separations and a judge’s order calling on federal authorities to put families back together in no more than 30 days, most families have not been reunited. This week, Ms. González’s family became the rare exception. “New York,” she said in Spanish when she spotted the skyline from a car. “My whole heart is there.” While she was held in detention centers in Arizona, Deyuin, Jamelin and Lester were sent to a shelter in New York, along with more than 300 children. Children separated at the border were scattered across 17 states. Ms. González cannot yet retrieve her children because of a long list of requirements from the federal government, but she saw them again on Tuesday, after more than five weeks apart. "
602,"CHILMARK, Mass. — For years, Alan Dershowitz, the lawyer and professor emeritus at Harvard Law School, has been a garrulous fixture in this handsome, gray-shingled town on Martha’s Vineyard. He holds court from a rocking chair on the porch at the Chilmark General Store, drinking coffee and greeting fellow regulars. He strolls down Lucy Vincent Beach, gabbing on his cellphone along the way. But this summer, Mr. Dershowitz says that because he has expressed views that back President Trump, he no longer feels so welcome on the Vineyard, a summertime epicenter of progressive values, money and sheer Democratic power in the United States. “I never thought I would see McCarthyism come to Martha’s Vineyard, but I have,” Mr. Dershowitz wrote in an opinion column last week in The Hill, revealing that he has been on the receiving end of a social chill from friends here. “For them, it is enough that what I have said about the Constitution might help Trump,” he wrote. “So they are shunning me and trying to ban me from their social life on Martha’s Vineyard.” Acquaintances and friends of Mr. Dershowitz on the island confirmed that his increasingly vocal defenses of Mr. Trump on cable news have not been well received in these social circles, particularly in Chilmark, one of the most liberal enclaves of this liberal island — and the town where Mr. Dershowitz has owned a home for a quarter-century. One Democratic couple who is used to running into Mr. Dershowitz at dinner parties said they have already been asking themselves: What are we going to do when we see Alan this summer? "
603,"A news report on Tuesday accusing Representative Jim Jordan of ignoring accusations of sexual abuse as a wrestling coach at Ohio State University has left a cloud over the powerful congressman as conservative activists put him forward as potentially the next speaker of the House. The university announced in April that it had started an investigation into accusations of sexual misconduct against a former team physician, Dr. Richard Strauss, who killed himself in 2005. The report, by NBC News, said that three former wrestlers said it was commonly known that Dr. Strauss showered with students and touched them inappropriately during appointments, and that Mr. Jordan, an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State from 1986 to 1994, must have known about the abuse. Mr. Jordan, a Republican, has denied that. “Jim knew this — there’s no ifs, ands or buts,” Michael DiSabato, one of the former wrestlers named in the NBC account, said Tuesday in an interview. “It boggles my mind that he would take the position that he’s taken.” A spokesman for Mr. Jordan, a founder of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus who represents a solidly Republican district in Ohio, said the congressman was unaware of any abuse. “Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State,” the spokesman, Ian Fury, said in a statement. “He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask because, if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice.” "
604,"President Trump plans to announce his second Supreme Court nominee on Monday, which also happens to be the 150th anniversary of the ratification of the 14th Amendment. That fortuitous bit of timing offers a good opportunity to consider what might be in store for the most important amendment outside the Bill of Rights, and arguably the most consequential provision of the entire Constitution, as Justice Anthony Kennedy steps down and the court gains a solid hard-right majority that could last deep into the 21st century. First, a little history. The original Constitution of 1787 was, for all its genius, a deeply self-contradictory document — a charter by and for a free people who enslaved hundreds of thousands of others. In 1776, America’s founders declared that human equality was not only a self-evident truth, but a fundamental premise of their new nation; barely a decade later, they officially rejected that premise, writing inequality and subjugation directly into the Constitution. Another truth soon became self-evident: If America was to survive, it would have to be reborn. That rebirth was embodied — after 80 years and a brutal civil war — in the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments, which together represented a radical recommitment to our first and highest principles. They outlawed slavery, made the newly freed slaves American citizens and guaranteed their right to vote. The 14th Amendment, in particular, “hit the reset button on American democracy,” as Sherrilyn Ifill, director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, put it recently. It extended the protections in the Bill of Rights, which applied only against the federal government, to cover people in their dealings with the states. Its best known and most litigated provision, Section 1, went even further, guaranteeing for the first time the basic equality of all people, no matter their skin color, station in life or citizenship. It’s worth reading that section in full: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” "
605,"LANCASTER, Pa. — Last week I wrote about why political parties across the industrial world are fracturing from the top down. Today I’m writing about the political units that are working. On this Fourth of July, if you want to be an optimist about America, stand on your head. The country looks so much better from the bottom up. I know — the current cliché is that we’re a country divided by two coasts, two coasts that are supposedly diversifying, pluralizing, modernizing and globalizing, while in flyover America everyone is high on opioids, cheering for President Trump and waiting for 1950 to return. That’s totally wrong. Our country is actually a checkerboard of cities and communities — some that are forming what I call “complex adaptive coalitions” and are thriving from the bottom up, and others that can’t build such adaptive coalitions and are rapidly deteriorating. You can find both on the coasts and both in the interior — and you can find both in just one little corner of south-central Pennsylvania. I was invited in April to give a paid book talk here in Lancaster, and I was so blown away by the societal innovation the town’s leaders had employed to rebuild their once-struggling city and county that I decided to return with my reporter’s notebook and interview them. My original host was the Hourglass, a foundation founded by community leaders in Lancaster County in 1997, when the city of Lancaster was a crime-ridden ghost town at night where people were afraid to venture and when the county’s dominant industrial employer, Armstrong World Industries, was withering. Some of the leading citizens decided that “time was running out” — hence “Hourglass” — and that no cavalry was coming to save them — not from the state’s capital or the nation’s capital. They realized that the only way they could replace Armstrong and re-energize the downtown was not with another dominant company, but by throwing partisan politics out the window and forming a complex adaptive coalition in which business leaders, educators, philanthropists, social innovators and the local government would work together to unleash entrepreneurship and forge whatever compromises were necessary to fix the city. "
606,"WASHINGTON — The string of insults, misstatements, exaggerations and outright falsehoods emanating from the White House began just after sunrise. In the space of a few hours, President Trump on Tuesday took credit for averting a war with North Korea, charged without proof that President Barack Obama had secretly granted citizenship to thousands of Iranians as part of nuclear disarmament negotiations and appeared to suggest that customers of the motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson were psychic. He called a sitting congresswoman “crazy” and “corrupt.” He branded the National Security Agency’s handling of millions of telephone call records “a disgrace” — and suggested it was connected to the special counsel investigation into whether his campaign worked with Russia to interfere in the 2016 elections. “Witch Hunt!” he wrote at the end of that tweet. The posts on Twitter spanned a range of foreign and domestic issues, and seemed to hew to two clear themes: Attacks on Mr. Trump’s perceived rivals, and trumpeting of what he considers his proudest achievements in the face of public criticism. This is partly true. “Many good conversations with North Korea — it is going well!” Mr. Trump tweeted, one day after a series of reports that the North is chugging forward with nuclear testing, despite its “denuclearization” pledge. “In the meantime no Rocket Launches or Nuclear Testing in 8 months. All of Asia is thrilled. Only the Opposition Party, which includes the Fake News, is complaining.” Then, with Trumpian flair, he added: “If not for me, we would now be at War with North Korea!” Mr. Trump is at least partly right: There have been no missile or nuclear tests since November, a “freeze” that many, including some Democrats, said was a necessary first step toward removing North Korea’s nuclear weapons. "
607,"WARSAW — Poland’s government carried out a sweeping purge of the Supreme Court on Tuesday night, eroding the judiciary’s independence, escalating a confrontation with the European Union over the rule of law and further dividing this nation. Tens of thousands took to the streets in protest. Poland was once a beacon for countries struggling to escape the yoke of the Soviet Union and embrace Western democracy. But it is now in league with neighboring nations, like Hungary, whose leaders have turned to authoritarian means to tighten their grip on power, presenting a grave challenge to a European Union already grappling with nationalist, populist and anti-immigrant movements. The forced retirements of up to 27 of 72 Supreme Court justices, including the top judge, and the creation of a judicial disciplinary chamber were the latest in a series of steps by Poland’s right-wing Law and Justice Party to take over the justice system. For years, the party has demonized judges as unreconstructed Communists and obstructionists. After coming to power in 2015, it took control of the Constitutional Tribunal, which is tasked with ensuring that laws do not violate the Constitution, and gave authority over the country’s prosecutors to the Ministry of Justice. Most recently, it asserted new powers to select judges. In recent days, judges who have spoken out against the changes have reported being harassed and intimidated. Each move has been greeted with international condemnation and angry demonstrations. Hours before the purge took effect at midnight, Poles again took to the streets in more than 60 cities and towns around the country. As the sun set in Warsaw, crowds gathered in front of a memorial dedicated to those who died in the city’s 1944 uprising against Nazi Germany, chanting an old but familiar refrain: “Solidarnosc.” But now, calls for solidarity were not directed at an occupying force — or at Communist rule, which the labor-backed Solidarity movement brought down in 1989 — but at a democratically elected government, albeit one the demonstrators fear is undermining the system they fought so hard to build. "
608,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump has delivered a blunt message to NATO allies: Spend more, or else. We gathered details of Mr. Trump’s letters to the leaders of countries including Germany, Canada, Norway and Belgium, chastising them for not increasing defense financing. It was the latest sign of acrimony between the U.S. and its traditional allies ahead of a NATO summit meeting next week. That meeting may well be overshadowed by another immediately following: Mr. Trump’s formal solo with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. We also have details of Mr. Trump’s phone call with the Mexican president-elect, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. The conversation, about immigration and trade, seems to have gone well. _____ 2. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s retreat on migration on Monday was a spectacular sacrifice. The German leader, who had staked her legacy on welcoming hundreds of thousands of migrants into the country, has now agreed to tighten the border with Austria and build camps to screen asylum seekers. Above, she attended a budget meeting on Tuesday. "
609,"WASHINGTON — One is a creature of Washington with two Yale degrees, a ticket-punching résumé that includes stints in the Justice Department, the Bush White House and a federal appeals court, where he has written some 300 opinions. The other, a former law professor, has been a judge for less than a year but could become the first woman named to the Supreme Court by a Republican president since 1981 — thanks in large part to a memorable exchange with Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, over her religious beliefs. The fight over who should replace Justice Anthony M. Kennedy on the Supreme Court is far from over, and there are still a half-dozen plausible candidates in the mix. But the stark contrast between two of the leading contenders — Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh and Judge Amy Coney Barrett — reflects the division on the right between the conservative legal establishment, which is hostile to government regulation and the administrative state, and social conservatives, who are focused on issues like abortion and religious freedom. Other candidates, notably Judges Raymond M. Kethledge and Amul R. Thapar, both of the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, have had cordial meetings with President Trump, and a White House spokesman said Mr. Trump interviewed three more possible choices on Tuesday. But according to a person close to the president, Judge Kavanaugh, who has served 12 years on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, is the leading candidate in the president’s mind, followed by Judge Barrett and then Judge Kethledge. Mr. Trump believes Judge Kavanaugh has been on the bench long enough to give the president a sense of where he stands on various issues and that Judge Barrett is fairly young and could use more judicial experience. The administration might want to keep her in reserve should Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 85, leave the court. The person close to the president cautioned that Mr. Trump could still change his mind between now and Monday, when the White House has said the choice will be announced. "
610,"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.
__________ More than $2.5 trillion in mergers were announced during the first half of the year, as fears of Silicon Valley’s growing ambitions helped drive a record run of deal-making. Four of the 10 biggest deals were struck in part to fend off competition from the largest technology companies as the value of acquisitions announced during the first six months of the year increased 61 percent from the same period in 2017, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. That has put mergers in 2018 on pace to surpass $5 trillion, which would top 2015 as the largest yearly total on record. Even rising global trade tensions did not manage to stifle acquisitions: Deals involving companies based in different countries nearly doubled compared with the first half of last year, and accounted for more than 40 percent of all announced transactions. The increase in deal-making has played out against the backdrop of a healthier economic outlook in many parts of the world nearly a decade after the recession. In the United States, interest rates remain low, corporate earnings are ballooning thanks in part to tax cuts and stock prices remain near historic highs. In this environment, companies have turned to mergers and acquisitions for growth, trying to grab market share and reinvent their business models, especially as Amazon, Netflix and other tech companies increasingly push into new industries. "
611,"As health insurers across the country begin filing their proposed rates for 2019, one thing is clear: The market created by the Affordable Care Act shows no signs of imminent collapse in spite of the continuing threats by Republicans to destroy it. In fact, while President Trump may insist that the law has been “essentially gutted,” the A.C.A. market appears to be more robust than ever, according to insurance executives and analysts. A few states are likely to see a steep spike in prices next year, but many are reporting much more modest increases. Insurers don’t appear to be abandoning markets altogether. In contrast to last year, regulators are not grappling with the prospect of so-called “bare” counties, where no carrier is willing to sell A.C.A. policies in a given area. “The market is in a better position now than it has ever been since the exchanges have opened,” said Deep Banerjee, who follows insurers for S & P Global Ratings. The companies first began selling policies in the state exchanges, or marketplaces, five years ago. After years of losses, the insurers are now generally making money. With roughly a third of states releasing information, the insurers’ rate requests vary widely, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. In Maryland, companies are seeking increases averaging 30 percent. A midlevel policy in Baltimore could cost $622 a month, roughly a third higher than the average of the other states reporting to date. In Minnesota, which created a reinsurance program to help pay for customers’ expensive medical conditions, carriers are actually seeking lower premiums. A midlevel policy in Minneapolis is priced at $302 a month. The political and legal turmoil in the market is likely to persist, and final premiums will not be established for months. States are still working out details of some of their proposals to stabilize their own marketplaces. Those could be blocked by the federal government or a federal court, as in the case of last Friday’s decision regarding the work requirement sought by Kentucky for its Medicaid program. "
612,"BRUSSELS — President Trump has complained about seeing too many German cars on Fifth Avenue, and threatened heavy tariffs on the companies that produce them. There is a good chance, though, that those Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs were not only made in the United States, but made by workers who voted for Mr. Trump. European companies have turned Alabama, South Carolina and Tennessee into auto manufacturing powerhouses in recent years, churning out cars not just for American buyers but also for export to China and Europe. Germany’s three biggest carmakers all have facilities there, and Volvo Cars, which is owned by a Chinese company but based in Sweden, began producing at a new plant in South Carolina just last month. Yet being major employers in regions that voted heavily for Mr. Trump has not protected them. With barely a peep of resistance from his own party, the president has threatened tariffs — expected to be 20 percent — on imported cars and car parts. In a prelude to such a move, he has ordered an investigation into whether the imports pose a threat to national security. Trade restrictions could be put in place within months. And if he follows through, the European Union has pledged to retaliate. The damage would be far-reaching, draining an estimated $14 billion from the United States economy. If other countries retaliated, the cost would skyrocket to nearly $300 billion, the European Union’s Washington delegation said last week. Carmakers, both foreign and domestic, say such penalties would severely damage their lines of supply, interfere with exports and eventually force them to curtail operations in, of all places, Republican strongholds. Mr. Trump won 63 percent of the vote in Spartanburg, S.C., home of BMW’s biggest factory anywhere in the world. But Allen Smith, president of the Spartanburg Area Chamber of Commerce, said the president’s tariffs would threaten the region’s livelihood. "
613,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. U.S. slaps at NATO, Malaysia charges Najib Razak, and Thailand weighs a cave exit. Here’s what you need to know: • The rearrangement of American alliances under President Trump continues apace. Details have emerged of sharply worded letters he sent to NATO leaders over defense funding, missives that increased acrimony ahead of next week’s NATO summit meeting. Adding to the tensions, that meeting will be immediately followed by Mr. Trump’s first formal solo meeting with a NATO antagonist: President Vladimir Putin of Russia. The Trump administration also reversed an Obama-era policy that urged universities to consider race as a factor in admissions — putting America’s long commitment to affirmative action at a crossroads, its future likely dependent on the justice who will be named to fill the coming vacancy on the Supreme Court. Mr. Trump has so far interviewed four candidates. _____ • Now for the rescue. After the exhilarating relief of locating 12 missing boys and their soccer coach, rescuers in Thailand now face the daunting challenge of pulling all 13 weakened individuals from the flooded cave network. Experienced cave divers think the evacuation could be managed if the boys wore full face masks, instead of trying to train them on the more sophisticated breathing equipment in scuba. One Thai naval official raised a terrifying worst-case scenario: leaving them in the cave for four months, until the end of the rainy season. "
614,"STERLING, Va. — Representative Barbara Comstock consistently attends Eid festivals at the Adams Center, one of the largest mosques in the United States. When a young Muslim earns his Eagle Scout Award, she is there reliably, bearing an American flag as a gift. The same has been true at Diwali, India’s festival of lights, at Korean National Day and Pakistan Day. In the diverse Washington, D.C., suburbs that make up a large swath of Virginia’s 10th Congressional District, Ms. Comstock is known for one trait: She shows up. But in this midterm election cycle, her dutiful courting, which saved her in 2016 when Hillary Clinton easily defeated President Trump in her district, may not be enough. This November, for many previously reliable Comstock voters, the name that will determine their vote will not be on the ballot: Donald J. Trump. “On a personal basis, people really like her, but when they walk into the polling booth, they look at it and say, ‘I am voting against Donald Trump and his administration,’” said Robert Marrow, a member of the Adams Center mosque. Few congressional districts present as great a challenge for a Republican incumbent as Virginia’s 10th. Though it stretches from the suburbs to rural areas, the district has one of the highest concentrations of college graduates in a Republican-held seat and is teeming with a vibrant, successful immigrant presence. It is also an area heavily reliant on connections to the government, and is increasingly seen as a Democratic stronghold in federal races. Ms. Comstock’s prospects dimmed further when Republicans nominated Corey Stewart as their Senate candidate last month. His positions on immigration, Confederate heritage and other social issues are widely seen as a drag for other candidates. On Saturday, the Fairfax County Republican Party held a “Meet the Ticket” event, headed by Mr. Stewart and two other congressional candidates. "
615,"The federal prosecutor who supervised the investigation of Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, has left the government and will be joining the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, the firm said. The former prosecutor, Tatiana R. Martins, 41, ran the public corruption unit in the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan for a year, having previously served as the deputy chief. Ms. Martins led the team that retried Sheldon Silver, the powerful former Democratic speaker of the New York State Assembly, who was convicted on corruption charges in May after a previous conviction was overturned last year. The new chief of the corruption unit is Russell Capone, 38, who was Ms. Martins’s deputy. He has investigated allegations of graft among police officials and helped to try Norman Seabrook, the former head of the city’s correction officers’ union. After a jury could not reach a verdict in Mr. Seabrook’s trial in November, a mistrial was declared, and he is to be retried this month. The personnel changes at the prosecutor’s office come under its relatively new head, Geoffrey S. Berman, who was named interim United States attorney in January by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and was formally appointed in April by the Federal District Court in Manhattan. The court acted after Mr. Trump did not nominate anyone to the post and Mr. Berman’s 120-day temporary term was about to expire. The office’s highest-profile known corruption investigation is of Mr. Cohen’s business dealings. Mr. Berman has been recused from that investigation, which instead was placed under his deputy, Robert S. Khuzami. Ms. Martins, who was born in Brazil and came to the United States as a child, worked as an associate at Davis Polk before becoming a prosecutor. She joined the United States attorney’s office in 2012. She also investigated Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s shutdown of the anti-corruption panel known as the Moreland Commission. (No charges were brought against Mr. Cuomo.) In 2015, she helped win the conviction of Dean G. Skelos, the former Republican State Senate majority leader. His conviction was also overturned on appeal, and he is being retried. Ms. Martins is returning to Davis Polk as a partner, focusing on white-collar criminal defense matters, the firm said. "
616,"Even before President Trump’s new Supreme Court nominee is announced, a fight over the choice is raging on social media. In the days since Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said he would retire, partisan groups have turned to Facebook, Twitter and other social networks with political ads. Some of the ads urge voters to pressure their senators to block or speed the confirmation process for Mr. Trump’s eventual nominee. Others oppose allowing specific jurists to fill the vacant seat. Judicial Crisis Network, an organization that promotes conservative judicial nominees, announced last week that it would spend more than $1 million to support Mr. Trump’s nominee. So far, the group has spent as much as $140,000 on a series of nearly two dozen Facebook ads. Many of the Facebook ads are targeted at users in North Dakota, Indiana and West Virginia, all red states with vulnerable Democratic senators who are up for re-election this year. The ads, which also appeared on Twitter, show a 30-second video with darkened images of Democratic lawmakers interspersed with bright images of Justice Neil Gorsuch. “Extremists will lie and attack the nominee,” the ad’s narrator says. “But don’t be fooled: President Trump’s list includes the best of the best, and with your help, America will get another star on the Supreme Court.” "
617,"To the Editor: This July 4, I wonder if we remain a truly independent country. We are governed by a president who may owe his election to Russian interference and who seems to welcome future efforts by Russia to rig our elections. That president generally serves Russian interests, not ours. He has fomented division among us; weakened the Western alliance; undermined the democracies’ economic strength through a trade war; ruined our country’s reputation as a haven for the oppressed and the downtrodden; stained America’s honor by lying and breaking agreements; paid homage to President Vladimir V. Putin and other dictators; and attacked the rule of law and freedom of the press. Many congressional Republicans have acted like blackmailed Russian apparatchiks, not the lawmakers of an independent Republic. I hope that this Fourth of July prompts reflection on the value of our independence and freedom and a determination to fight to preserve it. DAVID M. DRIESEN
FAYETTEVILLE, N.Y. The writer is a university professor of constitutional law and environmental law at Syracuse University. To the Editor: Re “Spend or Else, President Warns NATO Countries” (front page, July 3): The timing of the belligerent ultimatum — bullying our NATO allies for increased spending — is very telling, with the Trump-Putin summit meeting on the horizon. While NATO member countries may wonder “With allies like that, who needs enemies?,” President Trump is doing a terrific job degrading NATO. A collegial and constructive approach to the problem would not splinter NATO. Along with attacks on a free press (“fake news”), and due process (returning illegal immigrants without a hearing), steady progress toward Soviet values will make Vladimir V. Putin proud. GERALD BUSCH, BELLAIRE, TEX. To the Editor: I’ve noticed that President Trump recently used the phrase “my government.” It is not his government. The United States is a government “of the people, by the people and for the people.” What Mr. Trump can claim ownership of are the actions of his administration: the most immoral and corrupt in our history. His use of “my government” is not just sloppy language or historical ignorance. It represents an imminent threat to all freedom-loving Americans. It exposes a very distorted mind-set: that of a wannabe dictator. CHRIS SHEA, RENO, NEV. "
618,"A former technology worker for the House of Representatives accused of data theft by conservative news outlets pleaded guilty on Tuesday to an unrelated charge of making false statements on a loan application. The worker, Imran Awan, 38, was arrested last summer as he tried to board a flight to Pakistan. He had been at the center of a swirl of allegations that he and several associates had conspired to steal hardware, data and perhaps even Democratic National Committee emails published by WikiLeaks. President Trump had tried to heighten the intrigue, posting tweets claiming a media cover-up of a “Democrat I.T. scandal” and referring to Mr. Awan as a “Pakistani mystery man.” Mr. Awan, who is Pakistani-American, had worked for more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers since 2004, including Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. She defended him after the Capitol Police started looking into allegations by unnamed House lawmakers that Mr. Awan had executed some sort of fraud. In the plea agreement, federal prosecutors debunked conspiracy theories about the case that had circulated online. They said that the government had interviewed about 40 witnesses, examined the House Democratic Caucus server and other data and devices, reviewed electronic communications and interviewed Mr. Awan on numerous occasions. They found no evidence that Mr. Awan had engaged in illegal conduct involving House computer systems. Mr. Awan’s lawyer, Christopher Gowen, said the accusations were the product of an anti-Muslim, right-wing smear job targeting Mr. Awan and his family. He faulted Mr. Trump’s Twitter posts on the case, arguing they violated his client’s right to due process. Mr. Awan admitted to submitting an online application in December 2016 in the name of his wife, Hina Alvi, to the Congressional Federal Credit Union for a home equity line of credit on a property that she owned in Alexandria, Va. In the application, he stated that it was his wife’s primary residence. But in fact, she was renting the property to tenants. In January 2017, the credit union approved a line of credit for $165,000. Mr. Gowen said his client falsely listed the property as a primary residence in an effort to quickly transfer money to relatives in Pakistan to assist his father, who was gravely ill in Virginia. “He knows what he did was wrong,” Mr. Gowen said. “He made a mistake.” Mr. Awan’s sentencing was scheduled for Aug. 21. Under federal guidelines, he faces a likely range of zero to six months in prison. And as part of the agreement, the government will ask the court to dismiss all charges against Ms. Alvi when Mr. Awan is sentenced. "
619,"WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. — President Trump celebrated the service of military members and the talents of professional golfers on Tuesday in a reserved speech that, but for the presidential seal on the lectern and a few improvised flourishes, offered little deviance from the standard pre-dinner remarks at a signature sporting event. In remarks at the Salute to Service dinner before a military-themed professional golf tournament this week in West Virginia, Mr. Trump also sprinkled in boasts of the successes of his administration, including the push for what he called “clean coal” and the potential creation of a Space Force, and musings on the significance of the Fourth of July. But much of the speech was devoted to the current and former service members in the room. “From Bunker Hill to the beaches of Normandy and the jungles of Vietnam, Americans in every generation have given their last breath, their last measure of love,” Mr. Trump said, with the flags of the five military branches behind him. “Now we must fulfill our sacred duty to them,” he added, before jumping into a description of his administration’s efforts to change veterans’ health care and increase military spending. “We must protect those who protect us.” Mr. Trump also spent part of the speech, which lasted for just under a half-hour, admiring the prowess of the handful of professional golfers in attendance for A Military Tribute at the Greenbrier, the golf tournament set to begin Thursday at the eponymous luxury mountain resort. Mr. Trump’s largely subdued tone was a striking departure from his combustible and freewheeling persona at his rallies — and from the stream of exaggerations, misstatements and falsehoods that had filled his Twitter feed on Tuesday, including a couple of jabs posted en route to the resort. And while it was an unusual presidential excursion out of Washington to the site of a professional sporting tournament with a $7.3 million prize, it blended two of Mr. Trump’s passions: golf and the military.

621,"When Brayan was 9 years old, in 2016, his mother was brutally raped and murdered in Honduras. Her body was found in a septic tank. When Brayan saw her in the coffin, she was so disfigured that he couldn’t recognize her. She had been seven months pregnant. That’s when his nightmares began, his fear of the dark. His mother’s boyfriend had abused her and was arrested in the killing, but he claimed it was a gang killing and was set free. He threatened Brayan and his father, José, so José vowed to bring Brayan to safety in the United States. The opportunity to travel there safely arrived this year.   During Holy Week in late March, Brayan and his father joined a caravan of hundreds of Central American migrants fleeing through Mexico to the United States. When they arrived at the California border in May,  Brayan’s father — seeking to follow the letter of the law — heeded the advice of immigration advocates and presented himself and his son for asylum. Border Patrol officers refused to even glance at the notarized letters from lawyers making his case, José said. He was jailed for 20 days, asked to sign papers in English he did not understand and was deported to Honduras. Brayan was flown to a shelter for children in Maryland.    Brayan is now one of the more than 2,000 children — a conservative estimate — who have been separated from their families as part of the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance crackdown on undocumented immigration. On June 26, a federal district judge in San Diego ordered that those families must be reunited within 30 or fewer days — even though a Justice Department lawyer acknowledged there was no formal procedure to reunite families.   Brayan’s story, pieced together from interviews with him, his father and his grandmother — whose last names are being withheld because they are undocumented — shows just how hard the government is making the reunification process, and why every step of the zero-tolerance policy is needlessly traumatizing for thousands of children and their families.   Brayan’s grandmother, Rosa, is a 48-year-old undocumented immigrant doing everything in her power to become his sponsor and bring him to her Florida home. But navigating the bureaucracy has been a nightmare. A social worker at the Maryland shelter — the name of which is being withheld to protect Brayan — told Rosa that Brayan needed his own bedroom if she is to receive custody of him. So she gave up a one-bedroom apartment that she had rented for $400 a month and moved 25 minutes away to a two-bedroom apartment that costs $1,200 a month, she told me. She needed to present a lease, which is difficult for undocumented renters, and undergo a background check. She also needed proof of income, another roadblock for many undocumented workers. To afford the higher rent, she began working longer hours and on weekends. The social worker first told her she didn’t make enough money, then said she wouldn’t be around enough for Brayan if she worked such long hours.   "
622,"To the Editor: Re “Disarm North Korea ‘in a Year’? Reality Offers Sobering Contrast” (front page, July 2), about the “strain inside the administration over how to match promises with realism”: You report that despite President Trump’s recent statement that North Korea was destroying a major missile-engine test site, “the known sites are still standing, untouched, according to satellite photographs.” Other recent reports say satellite imagery shows that the North has been expanding its nuclear capabilities. One has to wonder what in fact was achieved at the much-touted Trump-Kim Jong-un summit last month, and what the United States can really do to ensure our security — something this president, for all his bombast, seems demonstrably incapable of achieving. PETER SUGAR, LINCOLN, MASS. "
623,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s upset primary victory has produced a huge amount of punditry about the supposed radicalization of the Democratic party, how it’s going to hurt the party because her positions won’t sell in the Midwest (and how well would Steve King’s positions sell in the Bronx?), etc., etc.. But I haven’t seen much about the substance of the policies she advocates, which on economics are mainly Medicare for All and a federal job guarantee. So here’s what you should know: the policy ideas are definitely bold, and you can make some substantive arguments against them. But they aren’t crazy. By contrast, the ideas of Tea Party Republicans are crazy; in fact, Ocasio-Cortez’s policy positions are a lot more sensible than those of the Republican mainstream, let alone the GOP’s more radical members. Since Ocasio-Cortez is being compared to Dave Brat, who unseated Eric Cantor, consider this: Brat favors a constitutional amendment forcing a balanced budget every year, which 96 percent of economists think is a really bad idea. Also, by the way, remember that Republicans won big in the midterms that followed Cantor’s demise. So, about Ocasio-Cortez’s positions: Medicare for all is a deliberately ambiguous phrase, but in practice probably wouldn’t mean pushing everyone into a single-payer system. Instead, it would mean allowing individuals and employers to buy into Medicare – basically a big public option. That’s really not radical at all. And if we’re talking economics rather than politics, every advanced country except America has some form of guaranteed health insurance; decades of experience show that these systems are workable; and they all have lower costs than we do. Calling for us to do what everyone else has managed to do is perfectly reasonable. What about a jobs guarantee? Ocasio-Cortez’s proposal can be thought of as a rise in the national minimum wage to $15, combined with a sort of public option for employment in case that wage rise leads either to private-sector job losses or an increase in labor force participation. "
624,"It was not the sort of complaint likely to draw public sympathy, and it did not. Alan Dershowitz, the lawyer and professor emeritus at Harvard Law School, argued in an op-ed last week for The Hill that Americans have grown increasingly intolerant of opposing political views, focusing on a call by Representative Maxine Waters to harass Trump administration officials wherever they go. But it was a personal note in the column that soon grabbed attention. “I never thought I would see McCarthyism come to Martha’s Vineyard, but I have,” he wrote, of the elite island enclave off Cape Cod where he is a fixture. Mr. Dershowitz, a self-professed “liberal Democrat,” said that friends on the Vineyard had snubbed him for publicly arguing against impeaching President Trump on television talk shows and in a forthcoming book. “For them, it is enough that what I have said about the Constitution might help Trump,” said the lawyer, known for his fierce advocacy for civil liberties and his defense of famous clients like O.J. Simpson and Claus von Bulow. “So they are shunning me and trying to ban me from their social life on Martha’s Vineyard.” This claim only seemed to draw a wave of mockery online that crested just as many of the nation’s media and political elites headed to the Cape for the Fourth of July. “It is outrageous that people are now shunning Alan Dershowitz in their social lives,” one Twitter user wrote. “Really, what the heck took so long?” "
625,"WASHINGTON — Over the past several weeks, protesters, Democratic lawmakers and candidates, and even some federal agents have demanded an end to the government agency known as ICE, railing against President Trump’s immigration policies, which have produced heart-wrenching images of migrants being stopped at the southwestern border. But the campaign against ICE may be conflating an alphabet soup of government agencies and their various roles in immigration enforcement. ICE, for example, was not separating migrant families illegally entering the United States from Mexico. Here’s an explanation of what it is doing. ICE stands for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security. ICE was created in 2003, as a part of the government’s reorganization after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. ICE is one of three agencies that absorbed and assumed the functions of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (which was previously housed under the Justice Department) and the United States Customs Service (which was part of the Treasury Department). The other two Homeland Security agencies that took some of those responsibilities are Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Citizenship Services. No. That’s Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency for the Border Patrol, which is responsible for patrolling, monitoring and securing the United States’ borders with Mexico and Canada. "
626,"Two pieces of big news came at the end of May to the home of Roni Lezama and his father, Carlos. Roni’s classmates at Millennium High School had elected him graduation speaker. Their choice was easy to understand. “He’s very good at writing, he’s incredibly smart, and he wasn’t just studying all the time,” Stella Krajick, a classmate, said. “He always has friends with him.” That same week in May, Carlos Lezama, 52, learned that he was to appear before a judge in October for deportation proceedings. Unlike his 18-year-old son, Mr. Lezama led a quiet, isolated life. “He’s very cautious,” Roni said. “He doesn’t go to bars because if something happens, he could be arrested.” Mr. Lezama came to the United States from Mexico City in 1994 and stayed, a violation of immigration law that his son says is the only blemish in an otherwise law-abiding, taxpaying, flag-waving life in the country. A quiet life does not mean a silent one. Father and son attended the new Star Wars movie in May and sat near a boy who was audibly imitating Chewbacca. After a few minutes, the mother of the boy ushered her son out. Another patron exclaimed, “Thank you! Finally!” The Lezamas were dismayed. “You didn’t have to be a genius to tell that the kid had a disability,” Roni said. “He wasn’t making those noises to be disruptive, he was enjoying the film like the rest of us.” "
627,"In the week since Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced his retirement, the future of Roe v. Wade has dominated the conversation among both liberals and conservatives, becoming a flash point in the partisan battle over President Trump’s pick to fill the seat. The effect Justice Kennedy’s retirement could have on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights has received less attention. The prospect of a more conservative justice, though, has L.G.B.T. rights groups worried about legal challenges from conservative groups that oppose gay marriage, who may see an opportunity to challenge rulings that have established its legality. L.G.B.T. groups have made great advances in recent years thanks largely to a string of Supreme Court decisions written by Justice Kennedy, including cases that legalized gay sex and established a right to same-sex marriage. “I’d really hate to see the clock turn back after we’ve made such tremendous strides,” said Stacey Long Simmons, advocacy director for the National L.G.B.T.Q. Task Force. Opposition to Roe v. Wade has been a driving force in American conservatism for decades. But Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 decision that legalized same-sex marriage, is a newer setback for religious conservatives. Many activists said they would welcome the chance to challenge the ruling, but they said it could take years for a case to reach the Supreme Court. “It is a recent decision,” said Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council. “The case is still being built as to why it is problematic.” "
628,"There’s little that President Trump loves more than cementing his supporters’ adoration of him while making his foes squirm. Nominating Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court would do both. She’s not just a staunch conservative over whom Republicans and Democrats would wage a familiar fight. She’s the prompt for an all-out culture war. I can almost see the president licking his chops. Since the announcement of Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement last week, Barrett, a judge on the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, has emerged as a front-runner for his seat. She was one of four finalists interviewed by Trump on Monday, when CBS News, without specifying its source or sources, identified her as one of two leading contenders. The other was Brett Kavanaugh, a judge on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Many conservatives are lobbying ardently on her behalf. Ramesh Ponnuru made a point-by-point case for her in a column for Bloomberg. Matthew Walther did the same in The Week. There’s plenty more elsewhere, and to wade through it is to realize, quickly, that the push for Barrett isn’t based solely on her credentials. It’s also based on the kind of debate about her that conservatives prophesy. Barrett, you see, talks readily and proudly about her Catholicism, making no bones about its presence at the center of her life. She and her husband have seven children, two of whom are adopted. She belongs to a mostly Catholic group, People of Praise, whose members make an especially intense commitment to their faith. And Republicans expect — and want — liberals to be so freaked out by this that they oppose her in a manner that can be branded anti-religious. They’re setting her up to be a Christian martyr, minus the grisly end, and daring Democrats to take the bait. The Washington Post’s Aaron Blake sagely sized up the appeal of this dynamic to Trump, writing that it’s “exactly the kind of battle he generally relishes: One that invites his opponents to overreach.” My Times colleague Ross Douthat tweeted that if Trump wants to “trigger the libs,” he’ll nominate Barrett. Douthat further predicted that her nomination “might bring on the culture-war apocalypse.” "
629,"“What do you want your sign to say?” I asked my son. We were walking home from the art supply store with a bag of foam-core board, brushes and tempera paint; the next day we were going to march against President Trump’s policy of separating and detaining undocumented immigrant families, many of whom had crossed the border seeking political asylum. Jacob didn’t have to think. “I want it to say, ‘Even 8-year-olds are outraged!’” I encouraged him to use bright colors, big letters. When you make a protest sign, I told him, its message flies out into the world. There may be thousands of people at a rally, and many of them will take pictures. If those pictures are shared, thousands of others may see your sign and hear what you have to say. They might even be inspired to take action themselves. He made a prototype, then lay on the floor and painted. When he was done, he showed me the sign. “Even 8 year olds are outraged about family separation!” he’d written in capital letters. How much do we tell our children about what’s going on in our country? When are they capable of becoming political human beings? A few days earlier, knowing we’d be marching together that Saturday, I’d made the decision to tell Jacob that Border Patrol agents, acting on President Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy, had separated families at the border, sometimes sending kids thousands of miles away from their parents, and that though the initial policy had changed, many of those families still weren’t reunited. I left out the scariest details. But the simplified version was enough. I saw the understanding pass over his face; I saw him feel sad, then angry. I was sorry he had to feel that way, and I’m sorry, more than words can express, for what the separated children and parents are going through. But I’m not sorry I told my son what’s going on. "
630,"The authorities cleared visitors from the Statue of Liberty on the Fourth of July after a woman protesting the Trump administration’s immigration policies climbed onto its base and refused to come down. About three hours later, police officers followed the woman onto the statue and took her safely into custody. The standoff created an unexpected spectacle in New York Harbor that culminated not long before the planned Independence Day fireworks were set to start nearby on the Hudson River. Television networks aired live coverage through the afternoon, showing a continuous video feed of the protester as she moved around the base of the statue. The woman started climbing shortly after 3 p.m. on what officials described as one of the busiest days of the year for the national monument. National Park Service officials said that more than 20,000 tourists typically visit the monument each July 4. Throughout the afternoon, the woman, identified by federal officials as Therese Okoumou, waved what looked like a T-shirt and reclined in a crease of the statue’s robe. The copper is only about one-tenth of an inch thick, and officials feared she could damage the statue. Before long, police officers and park rangers gathered beneath Ms. Okoumou after she refused their orders to come down. Attached to ropes, rescuers from the New York Police Department’s Emergency Service Unit climbed up and cornered her at about 6:30 p.m. Ms. Okoumou is in federal custody and is expected to appear in Manhattan federal court on Thursday, a spokesman for the United State’s attorney’s office said. "
631,"PARIS — I consider it a credit to my independence of spirit that despite being married to a journalist who covers soccer and raising several young soccer fanatics, I’ve managed to absorb practically nothing about the sport. I can sit alongside them as they hoot and moan at players on TV, then still ask, after an hour, “Wait, are Spain the red ones?” (Similarly, when I played softball as a kid, I’d forget whether I’d just batted and run to first base or whether I was the first baseman.) Despite this, I’ve come to appreciate soccer, and especially this year’s World Cup. It’s partly the free babysitting. While my husband is in Russia for five weeks covering the tournament, I’ve relaxed our usual screen-time rules and let my kids watch every match until bedtime. (I recently expanded this to include the extensive pregame and postgame commentaries.) It has been years — four, to be precise — since I’ve had this much free time. My affection for the World Cup isn’t purely selfish; I also think it’s good for kids. I’d heard that a few desperate fans jump off buildings when their team loses a key match — hardly the kind of loyalty I want to inspire in my offspring. In fact, my husband calculates that there are fewer suicides in the month that a European country’s national team plays in a World Cup, thanks to a generalized feeling of community and togetherness. (There’s no pent-up spike in suicides after that month, either.) Even losing unites people, because they join in a high-stakes drama whose outcome they know is, ultimately, inconsequential. “It’s a very safe escape from things that really matter, which is almost everything else in life,” he said. That “everything else” currently includes the dangerous nationalism taking root in Europe and the United States, by which immigrants and other foreigners are dehumanized and scapegoated, and leaders claim that certain countries are intrinsically worse. The World Cup, by contrast, offers an alternative, positive and tolerant form of nationalism in which you can cheer on your own country without denigrating people from elsewhere. Indeed, watching the World Cup almost always means identifying with multiple countries. Even if your own team is playing, you can adopt another. A Frenchwoman I know whose parents emigrated from Morocco and who married an Egyptian told me her 9-year-old son was all-in for Iceland until it got knocked out. "
632,"If you’re worried about terrorism, here’s a bigger threat to lose sleep over: an all-out cyberattack. Suddenly, the electricity goes out at the office. Cellphone networks and the internet have also gone black, along with subways and trains. The roads are jammed because traffic lights aren’t working. Credit cards are now just worthless bits of plastic, and A.T.M.s are nothing but hunks of metal. Gas stations can’t pump gas. Banks have lost records of depositors’ accounts. Dam floodgates mysteriously open. Water and sewage treatment plants stop working. People can’t reach loved ones. Phone systems are down, so 911 is useless. Looters roam the streets. Food and water soon run out in the cities. And that’s just the first week. Security experts have nightmares like that. Countries like Russia and China have implanted malicious software in the American electrical grid, nuclear power plants and water systems to have the capacity to mount such attacks — and we have done the same to them. Indeed, the U.S. prepared an extensive plan, Nitro Zeus, to unplug Iran through cyberattacks, but in the end we never implemented it. "
633,"I have devoted a substantial part of my intellectual life to defining and defending conservatism, as a social philosophy and a political program. Each time I think I have hit the nail on the head, the nail slips to one side and the hammer blow falls on my fingers. Like many others, both conservative and liberal, I did not foresee the political career of Donald Trump, nor did I imagine that such a man could occupy the highest office of state, in the name of a party that specifically makes appeal to conservative voters. Is this simply an aberration, or are there some deep links that tie the president to the great tradition of thought that I describe in my recent book, “Conservatism: An Invitation to the Great Tradition”? When describing the history of an idea, one naturally looks for its best expression. A history of liberalism will have a lot to say about John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, somewhat less to say about Hillary Clinton. A survey of the conservative idea will dwell at length on Edmund Burke and Thomas Jefferson and devote only a paragraph or two to Margaret Thatcher. On the other hand, Mrs. Thatcher, and to some extent Mrs. Clinton, are known for invoking the great figures of political philosophy and for showing an educated awareness that “ideas have consequences,” as the American conservative Richard Weaver expressed the point. In Mr. Trump we encounter a politician who uses social media to bypass the realm of ideas entirely, addressing the sentiments of his followers without a filter of educated argument and with only a marginal interest in what anyone with a mind might have said. Americans are conscious of their constitutional rights and freedoms. These assets are not guaranteed by human nature and exist only because Americans have fought for them. And they have fought for them as a nation, facing the future together. National identity is the origin of the trust on which political order depends. Such trust does not exist in Libya or Syria. But it exists in America, and the country has no more precious asset than the mutual loyalty that enables the words “we, the people” to resonate with every American, regardless of whether it is a liberal or a conservative who utters them. "
634,"On June 14, the New York State attorney general, Barbara Underwood, filed a civil complaint against President Trump and his three oldest children, accusing them of “persistently illegal conduct” in using the Donald J. Trump Foundation as “little more than a checkbook for payments from Mr. Trump or his businesses to nonprofits, regardless of their purpose or legality.” Ms. Underwood believes there is abundant evidence to bring criminal charges against Mr. Trump as well. She made that position very clear in the letters she sent to the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission in Washington recommending “further investigation and legal action.” Ms. Underwood sent those letters, at the same time she filed the civil complaint, because New York state law does not grant her automatic authority to initiate criminal investigations. Her criminal referral to Washington noted that it would be a crime for the president to interfere in such an investigation. However, given Mr. Trump’s assertion that he has the power to halt any criminal inquiry and to pardon himself for federal crimes, a criminal investigation by any part of the federal executive branch seems highly unlikely. The attorney general could, however, easily gain that authority. All that’s needed is for Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the New York State Police or the state Department of Taxation and Finance to make a request, and the authority would be granted to her. Criminal jurisdiction also rests with Cyrus Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney. Mr. Vance has shown no interest, so far, in investigating other complaints against Mr. Trump. A state or county criminal investigation that begins with abuse of the Donald J. Trump Foundation need not be limited to violations of charity and election law. It can also examine his personal and business tax filings and, in the process, lawfully put his tax returns in the public record. Mr. Trump reportedly used hundreds of thousands of foundation dollars to settle legal cases and buy portraits of himself that hang at Trump properties, among other egregious examples of self-dealing. Those foundation expenditures were income, and unless Mr. Trump reported that income, he could be prosecuted for criminal tax fraud. "
635,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Trauma for HNA, a big win for gay rights in Hong Kong and a nerve agent resurfaces in Britain. Here’s what you need to know: • A shocking loss for HNA. The family of Wang Jian, the Chinese conglomerate’s co-founder and co-chairman and one of China’s richest men, was flying to France to claim his body after he fell to his death while sightseeing in Provence. Above, Mr. Wang, at an event in New York last year. His death is a blow to HNA, which is trying to tame its debt of more than $90 billion. _____ • A watershed moment for gay rights in Asia. Hong Kong’s top court ruled that committed same-sex couples had the same rights to spousal visas as heterosexual couples. Advocates said the decision could have ripple effects in advancing gay rights. Banks and law firms had pushed for such recognition to lure and keep top talent. _____ • Novichok, again. The same Soviet-developed strain of nerve agent that poisoned an ex-Russian spy and his daughter in Britain four months ago has critically sickened two more people, the police said. "
636,"Captain America enjoys a rarefied position in the superhero pantheon. Since his 1940 debut (in which he punches Adolf Hitler in the face), Captain America has been defined as the quintessential patriot. In stories that have riffed on divisive political moments — Watergate, the War on Terror — the Captain, also known as Steve Rogers, has emerged as a complex man, one willing to question the direction his country takes. Marvel announced in February that the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates would assume writing duties on a new Captain America series, with the first issue rolling out on Independence Day.  Mr. Coates, now in his second year of working on the acclaimed “Black Panther,” noted that he relishes the chance to adapt “a walking emblem of greatest-generation propaganda” for the contemporary moment. For Coates, taking on this icon was not about leaving his mark on the character but embodying what he called the character’s “Lincolnesque optimism.”   “The opportunity of writing ‘Captain America’ wasn’t to make Steve Rogers talk like the son of somebody who had been in the Black Panther Party,” he said in a phone interview with The Times. “The opportunity was the son of somebody who had been in the Black Panther Party to talk like Steve Rogers. To get into that perspective.” The following are pages from “Captain America” No. 1, annotated with excerpts from an interview with Mr. Coates. Spoilers ahead. "
637,"LONDON — “Brexit” hard-liners have been compared to frogs being boiled alive, unaware that the water is being heated gradually to lethal temperatures. At a critical meeting of Britain’s bitterly divided cabinet on Friday, the question is whether any of the hard-liners will finally realize the difficulties and leap. The chief one to watch will be the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, perhaps the most overtly disloyal member of the rancorous cabinet. The meeting is being billed as a moment of truth for Prime Minister Theresa May, though one of many that have come and gone over the past year or so. At her official country residence, Chequers, she is expected to present her latest plan to soften the economic impact of Britain’s rupture with the European Union, known as Brexit. Most analysts think Mrs. May’s proposal would keep Britain closely aligned to Europe’s rules on manufactured goods, avoiding customs and other checks at frontiers, while services would be further removed, allowing Britain to strike non-European trade deals in these areas. In significant ways, this would make Britain a “rule taker not a rule maker,” and could require the country to accept other obligations — perhaps including contributions to the bloc’s budget. That is hardly the Brexit that the hard-liners envisioned and sold to voters. And so, this Friday, the dilemma for the hard-liners becomes acute: Should they continue the fight from inside, but risk facilitating a plan they despise; or should they quit and try to overthrow Mrs. May, but with no certainty of success? "
638,"Martina Navratilova’s voice was rising, inching higher and more animated with each word, each thought. She apologized for sounding so emotional, but she couldn’t help herself. “What’s happening at those detention centers in Texas is unconscionable, just beyond belief,” said Navratilova, the top-ranked woman in tennis for much of the 1970s and ’80s. “All these people who are lying through their teeth, saying, ‘The kids are O.K. — it’s like summer camp.’ I’m like, ‘Are you kidding me?’ “We complain about Boko Haram taking the girls in Nigeria, and here we are doing it to these women and men. And the kids are marked for life. Some will never be reunited. Some parents will never know what happened to their kid.” Navratilova’s concern about families being separated is borne of personal experience. After fleeing Communist Czechoslovakia at 18 to seek political asylum in the United States during the 1975 United States Open, Navratilova went nearly four years without seeing a member of her own family. She has said it was the most painful time in her life. During that period, on July 7, 1978, Navratilova won the first of her record nine Wimbledon singles titles, kick-starting a career that would eventually include 18 Grand Slam singles championships. “I was so happy, but it was bittersweet because my parents weren’t there and I didn’t even know if they were going to be able to see the match,” said Navratilova, who is tied with Billie Jean King with a record 20 Wimbledon titles in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. “That’s when you put the blinders on and just keep going. It was all very emotional, but you don’t dwell on it because, if you do, you can’t play.” "
639,"Workers across the technology industry are forcing their employers to reconsider how their products are being used by the United States government. At Microsoft, employees protested the company’s contract with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Workers at Amazon pushed the firm to stop selling facial recognition services to law enforcement agencies. And after thousands of employees signed a petition against building “warfare technology,” Google decided last month against renewing a contract to provide artificial intelligence systems for the Pentagon. But it’s premature to declare those giant tech companies as suddenly woke. The government contracts in question are inconsequential to their fortunes. A better test of tech-worker activism would involve a company with a primary product that is being used to inject misinformation and authoritarian speech into mainstream conversation — and, more to the point, a company that appears to have directly benefited from the toxic flood of political vitriol in which all of us are now drowning. In other words: Will there be an employee uprising at Twitter? The social network favored by President Trump has a complicated political ethos. Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder and chief executive, is an outspoken supporter of liberal causes, and the company has reveled in its centrality to viral progressive movements — the Arab Spring, #BlackLivesMatter, #metoo and #MarchForOurLives were all animated by forces on Twitter. But Twitter’s real-world effect has hardly been a liberal panacea. Around the world and particularly in the United States, Twitter is used every day to infuse misogyny, racial and ethnic animus and conspiratorial thinking into mainstream news coverage. "

641,"To the Editor: Re “Secretaries Guard Inmates as Cuts Hamstring Prisons” (front page, June 18): Jails and prisons are where society puts the problems it doesn’t want to see and are the last places politicians want to spend money. But I’ve learned it’s the one place where the money can be well spent, and public oversight is critical. That is why I was incredulous reading about the understaffed federal prison system, especially given the government’s intense scrutiny of my jail — the Cook County Jail in Chicago — over that very issue. Upon becoming sheriff in 2007, I set out to make major changes at the jail, but that same year the Justice Department began an investigation into the jail. What resulted was an agreed court order that outlined areas to improve and federal monitors given unfettered jail access. While I had already begun reforms, the consent decree ensured funding for additional staffing, among other improvements. Seven years of hard work, transparency and collaboration ended the consent decree. At a time when jails and prisons have been asked to become mental health centers and opioid clinics, now is not the time to cut staff and deny outside access. The government needs to give the same scrutiny it gave my jail to its own prisons. TOM DART, CHICAGO The writer is Cook County sheriff. "
642,"LONDON — When major oil producers last met in Vienna, they said they would curb rising prices by ramping up production. Why, then, are oil prices still going up? Officials from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and other major oil producers like Russia pledged last month to increase total output by around 1 percent of the global oil supply. President Trump has pressed the issue further, repeatedly calling for lower oil prices. Yet prices have remained stubbornly high. The price of Brent crude, the international benchmark, has risen more than 20 percent so far this year, to around $78 a barrel. Here are some of the factors pushing prices higher. Saudi Arabia is under pressure to quickly increase its production of oil, but those increases may not be enough to offset declines in three countries grappling with crises: Iran, Libya and Venezuela. The Trump administration has softened demands that countries like China and India end all imports of oil from Iran. But Mr. Trump has nevertheless sought to line up support against Tehran as the United States prepares to reimpose sanctions on its energy sector. At present, Iran exports around two million barrels of oil a day, equivalent to about 2 percent of global supply. But the United States wants to drastically curb Tehran’s ability to sell its natural resources, eating into any additional supply from Saudi Arabia, Russia or elsewhere. "
643,"I have been feeling so much despair that, even as a media scholar, I’m often tempted to avoid the news. The unending stream of political developments that I know will deepen the suffering of my fellow Americans and others around the world is heartbreaking: migrant children separated from their parents, mass shootings that don’t inspire gun control, the crisis in Yemen, threats to women’s rights, and so much more. It might be surprising to hear that what’s been keeping me going lately is meditating on slavery. I’ve been reading Sojourner Truth’s famous 1851 speech, “Ain’t I a Woman.” Truth reportedly said: “I could work as much and eat as much as a man, when I could get it, and bear the lash as well! And ain’t I a woman? I have borne 13 children and seen most of them sold off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mother’s grief, none but Jesus heard me! And ain’t I a woman?” When Truth asked the group of mostly white women in her audience whether she was a woman, she was not simply pointing to the hypocrisy of Western thought in which nations and “civilized” societies were built on the enslavement, murder and exploitation of women and children. Truth’s question was a provocation, a challenge to a racial structure built on the dehumanization of an entire group of human beings. It was a philosophical gauntlet. Like Black Lives Matter, it was a call to bring clarity to American oppression. Today, it’s also a reminder to me that black people have lived through the very worst of what this country has inflicted. That we have survived. The barbarity of American slavery should be recalled more often, if only to truly understand the significance of its demise. It was the grief of losing one’s child, being raped, beaten, tortured and separated from your own language, family and friends at a whim. It was a system that normalized and codified its everyday brutality. It was life in constant fear and punishing, exacting labor. And it was completely legal. "
644,"The philosopher Martha C. Nussbaum wants Americans to get in touch with their feelings; not in a fit of self-indulgence but as a righteous act of civic duty. In “The Monarchy of Fear: A Philosopher Looks at Our Political Crisis,” she writes against a (mostly male) tradition of philosophical and political thinking that minimizes emotions as merely a source of irrationality and embarrassment. With more than two dozen books to her name, Nussbaum has been here before. Her ample body of work casts feelings as not just worthy of study but essential for understanding our political selves. But the 2016 presidential election made her realize she “hadn’t gone deep enough.” A self-described “liberal social democrat,” she was so shaken by Donald J. Trump’s victory — having been “reasonably confident that appeals to fear and anger would be repudiated” — that she felt an overwhelming sensation of alarm. She believed fear was what had gotten Trump elected, and here she was, so scared that she was momentarily incapable of being “balanced or fair-minded”: “I was part of the problem that I worried about.” An elegant and precise stylist, Nussbaum has always seemed a peculiar spokeswoman for bringing unruly emotions into the fold. She writes about gut feelings like envy and disgust with an air of serene lucidity. In “The Monarchy of Fear,” she insinuates that her postelection alarm felt not just uncomfortable but alien to her. She has spent decades parsing the role of negative emotions while resisting their seductive pull. Even her brush with political anxiety in 2016 lasted less than 24 hours. Once she realized she might be able to wring some insight from upheaval, she “went back to sleep with a calming sense of hope.” Since we’re talking about feelings, I’ll confess to experiencing pinpricks of irritation when I came across that self-satisfied line, which appears on the second page of Nussbaum’s preface, before she has even started to make her argument. But one of the virtues of this slender volume is how gradually and scrupulously it moves, as Nussbaum pushes you to slow down, think harder and revisit your knee-jerk assumptions. She’s transparent about her beliefs and her background, describing her cosseted upbringing in Philadelphia as “fairly affluent” (and her father, whom she loved and eventually rebelled against, as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic). She admits that her “highly privileged life” as a celebrated academic affords her the luxury of contemplating at leisure what plenty of people are experiencing as a national emergency. Nussbaum might live differently than most Americans do, but she wants to put that remove to good use. Where other members of the elite might flee or close ranks, she insists on engagement, accepting the “responsibility of dissecting our own moment and our own pathologies.” "
645,"WASHINGTON — When the North Koreans were shooting off missile tests and detonating new, more powerful atomic bombs last year, President Trump responded with threats of “fire and fury” and ordered the military to come up with new, if highly risky, pre-emptive strike options. But since the one-day summit meeting last month in Singapore, Mr. Trump has done an about-face, while the North’s nuclear program has continued. “Many good conversations with North Korea-it is going well!” he wrote Tuesday morning on Twitter. Even the recent revelations of seemingly modest North Korean progress on missile technology and the production of nuclear fuel — including continued work on a new nuclear reactor that can produce plutonium — have not dimmed Mr. Trump’s enthusiasm. He argues that they mean little compared to the new tone of conversations, and that even though North Korea has not disassembled a single weapon, his mission should be judged a success. It is that jarring reversal of tone that has led Mr. Trump’s critics to argue that he was taken in by Kim Jong-un, the North’s 34-year-old leader. Turning the enthusiasm of the meeting in Singapore into a concrete, verifiable agreement is now the job of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is leaving Washington early Thursday for North Korea. It will be his third trip there, but the first to flesh out a timetable and a common understanding of what the Singapore commitment to “work toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” really means. Complicating the task is this: Mr. Pompeo, a former C.I.A. chief who knows the details of the North Korean program intimately and has solicited plans for how to accomplish his goals, must show that he can get the North Koreans to go far beyond the agreement his predecessor once-removed, John Kerry, achieved in negotiations with Iran. Mr. Trump has called that deal a “disaster” for years and pulled out of it two months ago. "
646,"President Trump boasted Tuesday on Twitter about his ability to write. Specifically, he defended his seemingly random use of capitalization. His method? He said he uppercases certain words for “emphasis” — not because they should, in fact, be capitalized. (His tweet, which was later deleted and reposted, also used an incorrect homophone — “pour” instead of “pore” — and contained a dangling modifier. But that’s a story for another day.) Mr. Trump’s distinctive philosophy of capitalization has brought us Witch Hunt and Fake News, a big-B Border and Crime with a capital C. But what are the actual rules of capitalization? And, in an era of tweeting, texting and Trump, when is it O.K. to break them? We talked to experts and channeled our inner nerds to bring you this handy guide. "
647,"China will succeed in building a powerful technology industry that will rival the United States, even if President  Trump starts a trade war to stop it. The reason can be found on the fourth floor of a nondescript factory in a city once famous for cheap manufacturing and prostitution. This factory floor, in the southern Chinese city of Dongguan, once employed what one employee called a “magnificent sea of people.” Rising labor costs and a new generation with little interest in toiling in factories forced a new tack. Now the sea of people is being replaced by a whirring array of boxy machines, each performing work it used to take 15 people 26 steps to finish. The factory suggests that Beijing’s vision of Made in China 2025 — the ambitious state-driven plan to retool China’s industries to compete in areas like automation, microchips and self-driving cars — is not being pushed just by the Communist Party’s top leaders. Instead, the drive is also coming from the bottom up: from the businesses and cities across China that know they must modernize or perish. The Trump administration is not wrong to confront Beijing over Made in China 2025. China’s  top-down approach gives its companies unfair advantages and could continue to roil global trade relations long after Mr. Trump retires to Mar-a-Lago. But Made in China 2025 is also being propelled by businesses like Dongguan Mentech Optical & Magnetic Company, the owner of the factory, which are worried about labor costs and their own futures. It comes from local governments looking for ways to stay relevant. It comes from a growing network of private-sector entrepreneurs, academics and local politicians who are increasingly working together to overhaul China’s factories and its future. Other cities — Suzhou, Wenzhou, Xuzhou and the industrial areas around Shanghai are just a few examples — have also drummed up their own automation plans. The modernization may not happen in 2025. In fact, it may be long after that. But China will get there, mostly because it has to. "
648,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Poland purges its Supreme Court, Austria tightens its borders and England squeaks past Colombia. Here’s the latest: • Poland’s government carried out a sweeping purge of the Supreme Court, after a step-by-step undermining of judicial independence by the governing Law and Justice party over the past three years. Up to 27 of the nation’s 72 justices, including its top judge, Malgorzata Gersdorf, above, are expected to retire. Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets across the nation in protest. Warsaw’s erosion of the judiciary’s independence is a further display of its alignment with neighboring nations like Hungary, whose leaders have turned to authoritarian means to tighten their grip on power. The shift presents a grave challenge to the European Union, which is already grappling with nationalist, populist and anti-immigrant movements. _____ • In Austria, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, above, announced his country’s intentions to tighten its border with Germany and build camps to screen asylum seekers. The declaration follows a similar announcement on increasing border security by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who had previously staked her legacy on welcoming hundreds of thousands of migrants. It’s hard to overstate the stakes at play, our Interpreter columnists write, including the possible end of open European borders — or even European unity itself. "
649,"WASHINGTON — Donald J. Trump first reached out to them about three years ago, when he was regarded as a political sideshow and they were desperate for any attention to their plight. Today, thanks to the platform now afforded by President Trump, the group he calls “angel families” — relatives of people killed by undocumented immigrants — have grown into a political force, helping him justify the most unpopular aspects of his administration’s immigration crackdown, and championing other candidates and causes devoted to limiting illegal immigration. It is a mutually beneficial, and deeply felt, relationship that resonates well beyond the families who have grown so close to Mr. Trump that he remembers their names and those of their deceased loved ones, and privately relays praise of their appearances on Fox News. The rotating group of families who have appeared at times with the president — totaling more than three dozen — provide a powerful rejoinder to criticism of Mr. Trump’s hard-line approach to immigration as heartless, in some ways embodying his gift for creating narratives that resonate more with his base than concrete policy proposals or statistics undermining his argument that unauthorized immigration leads to increases in crime. And the Trump administration is keeping the families close, paying to bring several of them to Washington last month for a private White House meeting, followed by a news conference nearby at which they defended the president against criticism of his recently reversed policy of separating children from their undocumented immigrant parents at the border. “You never hear this side,” Mr. Trump said. “These are the American citizens permanently separated from their loved ones — the word ‘permanently’ being the word that you have to think about — ‘permanently.’ They’re not separated for a day or two days. These are permanently separated because they were killed by criminal illegal aliens.” "
650,"Many of the nonprofits, corporations and religious groups watching over migrant children detained at the southwest border have been in this business for years — and they have a history of political connections, donating millions of dollars to Democrats and Republicans alike. Now, as new federal policies greatly expand the number of migrants held in detention, it is also becoming clear that some of the players in this billion-dollar industry have particularly strong ties to the Trump administration. The president’s education secretary provided funding to one of the groups. His defense secretary sat on the board of another. Mr. Trump’s own inauguration fund collected $500,000 from two private prison companies housing detained migrant families. And some of the contractors employ prominent Republican lobbyists with ties to Mr. Trump and his administration, including someone who once lobbied for his family business. There is no indication that political favors or influence motivated any of the contracts, and the service providers have no apparent ties to the agency awarding most of the contracts, the Department of Health and Human Services. Many of the groups had federal contracts to work with migrant children long before President Trump took office. Yet the administration’s new focus on ending the practice of “catch and release,” under which an ever-larger number of those apprehended at the border are held in detention, has meant that the business of housing and caring for migrant children is booming. A review of regulatory filings, campaign donations and lobbying records reveals a number of important links between people in Mr. Trump’s orbit and the groups poised to earn financial rewards from his immigration policies. Migrant youths detained at the border are housed at more than 100 government-contracted shelters, detention centers and other facilities across the country. "
651,"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — Just before 9 a.m. on the Fourth of July, the gong on Monticello’s roof rang, silencing the crowd that had gathered to celebrate those vowing to uphold and protect the ideals of the United States. The sound heralded the pageantry that was moments away, when nearly 70 people would ascend the stairs of Thomas Jefferson’s mountaintop plantation in one of the country’s largest outdoor naturalization ceremonies. “This place for me is for the birth of America, birth of liberty and, now, the birth of my citizenship,” said Joseph Csaba Nagy, formerly of Romania, who arrived Wednesday to take the oath of allegiance in a suit that he had saved for the occasion: a blue jacket with white stars, red pants and a red-and-white striped tie. But there was subtext to this naturalization ceremony at Monticello, where the legacy of a Founding Father is being rewritten to acknowledge that Jefferson, a slave owner, failed to truly include all when he wrote “all men are created equal.” “Jefferson’s notion of liberty, while visionary for its time, did not extend to all people,” said Leslie Greene Bowman, the president of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, recognizing both the enslaved people who lived and worked at Monticello and the estate’s new public acknowledgment of Sally Hemings, the slave who bore Jefferson’s children.

652,"To the Editor: Re “Republican or Conservative, You Have to Choose” (column, June 26): David Brooks tries to rescue legitimate conservatism from Donald Trump’s Republican Party with a childish version of political theory. He writes, “Conservatives fought big government not because they hated the state, per se, but because they loved the sacred space,” based on “prerational cords of sympathy and affection.” Among the sacred spaces traditionally loved by conservatives were white-only neighborhoods, white-only schools, white-only fire departments and white-only swimming pools; men-only law firms, sports leagues and bars; and Christian-only universities. And the Republican Party long ago made its peace with the market fundamentalism that Mr. Brooks thinks arrived only yesterday.

653,"THURSDAY PUZZLE — Yes, hi, I know you’re frustrated. Well, some of you are. Other people probably solved this puzzle as if it were nothing, and bully for them, I say. But some of us need more help than that. I tumbled to the fact that there was a trick to this theme fairly quickly, mostly because of the cursing. When one particular trick is present in a puzzle, you’ll know it because you’ll find yourself not being able to fill in many entries, hence the cursing. The trick is revealed in the Theme section below. Randolph Ross is back, and he offers us a respite from the peace and fun of a midweek day off from work, instead getting us thinking about the alleged inner workings of our government agencies.  And why not? How much fun, relaxation and not having to think about the goings-on in the world can one person take? 26A: “Wee wee?” is another way of saying “A smaller version of something small,” and the answer is the contraction LI’L. And yes, I know what the clue looks like it implies. Don’t laugh. This is my job. 30A: Usually when you see a clue like “Ain’t right?,” the puzzle is looking for a correction to the grammar (or, AIN’T the “right” way), so the answer would be ISN’T.  Today, the answer is ARE. 46A: Wordplay alert! “Chest thumper, for short?” could be an abbreviation for a braggart, but how would you do that? Instead, think about another kind of chest thumper: an emergency medical worker, or E.M.T. "
654,"WASHINGTON — “The assault on the American auto industry is over,” President Trump declared last spring in Detroit, promising auto executives that he would throttle back Obama-era regulations on vehicle pollution. The moment embodied one of Mr. Trump’s main political promises — to promote pro-business policies that unshackle industry and the economy. He has pledged to create an oil and gas boom that will spawn “massive new wealth” and to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement to eliminate “big trade barriers” for American products. His new taxes on metal imports “have already had major, positive effects” on classic Rust Belt industries like steel and aluminum, the White House has said. Even as the president’s pro-business stance is broadly embraced by the corporate community, in some significant cases the very industries that Mr. Trump has vowed to help say that his proposals will actually hurt them. They also warn that policies designed to aid one group will eat into someone else’s business in ways that policymakers should have anticipated. “I would like to tell the president, ‘Man, you are messing up our market,’” said Kevin Scott, a soybean farmer in South Dakota and the secretary of the American Soybean Association. The idea of changing Nafta, he said, “gives us a lot of heartburn in farm country.” At the same time, Mr. Scott said, China’s threat to impose tariffs this week on United States soybeans — in direct response to Mr. Trump’s tariffs on other Chinese-made products — is already having a negative effect on the prices farmers see. In recent days, Canada imposed its own retaliatory tariffs against the United States. And on Friday, General Motors warned that Mr. Trump’s threat of tariffs on imported cars could backfire, killing American jobs and leading to “a smaller G.M.” Mr. Scott voted for Mr. Trump, and he approves of administration efforts to roll back environmental regulations, “But if we lose those Chinese and Mexican markets, it will be hard to get them back,” he said. China and Mexico are the two biggest markets for American soybean exports. "
655,"Overturning Roe? Watch what you wish for, Republicans. The imagined implications of Justice Anthony Kennedy’s resignation for the future of legal abortion have brought visions of long-awaited sugar plums to anti-abortion politicians and activists.  In 2016, Donald Trump pledged to appoint anti-abortion justices to the Supreme Court, saying that two or three such appointments would mean the end of Roe v. Wade. Next week, we get the name of President Trump’s second pick.  Mr. Trump’s anti-abortion supporters —  including his evangelical advisers, the National Right to Life Committee, Americans United for Life, the Susan B. Anthony List, and most significantly,  the Republican Party — are now confident that it is just a matter of time until Roe is overturned.   Yet the celebration around Roe’s demise seems premature, if not downright dangerous for the Republican Party. For starters, there is muted recognition that even under a Supreme Court populated by conservative Trump appointees, Roe v. Wade may not be overturned. This is because judges of all leanings are guided not only by their views on specific issues but also by foundational jurisprudential principles. These include stare decisis, which holds that unless there is a very strong reason for overturning a prior decision, that decision should stand as the rule for similar cases in the future.  Early in our history, Americans rejected the idea of courts swaying to whatever political breeze blew in at election time. Citizens should be able to rely on the durability of constitutional law no matter who is in office. Indeed, the last big challenge to Roe was decided on the basis of stare decisis. In 1992, conservative-leaning justices refused to overturn Roe in a case called Planned Parenthood v. Casey.  They explained that although they might have voted against Roe had they been on the court in 1973, they would not vote to overturn it 20 years later.  They found that nothing in the law had changed in the interim to justify overturning Roe. In fact, the court held quite the opposite, noting  that an entire generation of people “have organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society, in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail.” This kind of social reliance might be even more weighty two generations after Roe. But let’s assume, as both the left and the right seem to do, that of the nine justices, five of them can see their way clear to overturning Roe.  How could that be bad news for Republicans? Since the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan brought the anti-abortion movement into the Republican tent, a coalition of Republicans and evangelicals has focused on abortion generally and Roe in particular, as the super fuel that energizes the right. The ongoing Republican commitment to eliminating legal abortion by overturning Roe was evident in the 2016 election. Then, 70 percent of conservative voters said that the issue of Supreme Court appointments was very important to how they planned to vote, more than any other group. Small wonder then that President Trump said in a speech before the Susan B. Anthony List in May, “Now, for the first time since Roe v. Wade, America has a pro-life president, a pro-life vice-president, a pro-life House of Representatives, and 25 pro-life Republican state capitols.”  From this perspective, what’s not to like about Roe’s reversal? Counterintuitively perhaps, there are quite a few things.  Getting rid of Roe would deprive the far right of one of its most crowd-pleasing, rabble-rousing, go-to issues.  After all, there is plenty to dislike about abortion, if one is so inclined: the assumed sexual promiscuity of careless women and disobedient girls; the view that abortion is murder; and the power Roe gave to women by liberating them from their traditional place in the home. Roe bashing is a powerful source of solidarity; its absence would deprive Republican politicians and Fox News of the issue that stands at the ready to roil the political pot. "
656,"Many Americans were shocked last week when Attorney General Jeff Sessions turned to the Bible — specifically, Paul’s epistle to the Romans — to justify President Trump’s policy of separating migrant children from their parents. This scriptural justification for a political decision should not have surprised anyone, because Mr. Trump’s administration has consistently treated the separation of church and state as a form of heresy rather than a cherished American value. Attacks on the wall of separation established by the founders — which the religious right likes to call “a lie of the left” — are nothing new. What has changed under Mr. Trump is the disproportionate political debt he owes to extreme religious conservatives, whose views on church-state issues — ranging from the importance of secular public education to women’s and gay rights — are far removed from the American mainstream. The very meaning of the phrases “religious liberty” and “religious freedom”— traditionally understood as referring to the right of Americans to practice whatever faith they wish or no faith at all — is being altered to mean that government should foster a closer relationship with those who want to mix their Christian faith with taxpayer dollars. This usage can be found in numerous executive orders and speeches by Mr. Trump and his cabinet members. Changes in language have consequences, as the religious right’s successful substitution of “pro-life” for “anti-abortion” has long demonstrated. Religion-related issues, especially if buried in lengthy government documents, can often seem obscure, but they dominated the news at the end of June, when the Supreme Court upheld Mr. Trump’s travel ban targeting majority-Muslim countries and struck down a California requirement that anti-abortion, state-licensed pregnancy clinics provide notice to their clients that abortion is an option. These significant rulings were immediately overshadowed by the retirement from the court of the frequent swing voter Anthony M. Kennedy, which now gives Mr. Trump the opportunity to nominate a predictable religious conservative who would most likely support the overturning of Roe v. Wade. While it is impossible to overstate the long-term importance of the next court appointment, Mr. Sessions and many of his fellow cabinet members offer textbook examples of the everyday perils of entangling religion with politics. Mr. Sessions’s citation of the opening verse of Romans 13, which declares that every soul must be “subject to the governing authorities” and that there is “no authority except that which God has established,” inflamed an already bitter debate over immigration. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, followed up with a reminder that it was “very biblical” to enforce the law. Neither went on to quote the verse in the epistle that proclaims, “Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.” "

WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and architect of President Trump’s aggressive effort to rewrite the government’s rule book on environmental regulations, resigned on Thursday in the face of numerous ethics investigations that doomed his tenure. Despite Mr. Pruitt’s efforts to nurture a close relationship with the president, Mr. Trump himself announced the resignation in a tweet sent from Air Force One. He thanked Mr. Pruitt for an “outstanding job” and said the agency’s deputy, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, would take over as the acting administrator on Monday. Mr. Pruitt in his resignation letter cited “unrelenting attacks on me personally” as one of the reasons for his departure. Mr. Pruitt had been hailed by conservatives for his zealous deregulation, but he could not overcome a spate of questions about his alleged spending abuses, first-class travel and cozy relationships with lobbyists. Mr. Pruitt also came under fire for enlisting aides to obtain special favors for him and his family, such as reaching out to the chief executive of Chick-fil-A, Dan T. Cathy, with the intent of helping Mr. Pruitt’s wife, Marlyn, open a franchise of the restaurant. "
658,"WASHINGTON — Federal immigration agents apprehended just over 42,500 people at the southwestern border in June, according to data released on Thursday by the Department of Homeland Security, a drop in the number of migrants trying to enter the United States after a spike the previous three months. Border Patrol agents arrested 34,114 people trying to enter the country while customs officers at ports of entry denied entry to 8,451 people, including families and children who showed up at the border alone, the numbers show. About 5,562 unaccompanied children showed up at the border in June, while 12,192 people traveling in family groups were denied entry, the data shows. The apprehension statistics show a drop in the number of people trying to enter the country after the numbers exceeded more than 50,000 in each of the three months before June. That came after a year in which the numbers of people apprehended had dropped to a more-than 40-year low. On Thursday, Homeland Security officials attributed the drop in apprehensions to the hard-line immigration policies of the Trump administration. “Following the implementation of the administration’s zero-tolerance policy, the June 2018 southwest border migration numbers declined by 18 percent when compared to the previous month,” said Tyler Q. Houlton, a department spokesman, who was referring to the administration’s policy that seeks to prosecute all people who illegally enter the country. The new policy resulted in thousands of children being separated from their families and prompted national protests. Mr. Trump signed an executive order last month directing agencies to stop separating children from their families, but said the zero-tolerance policy remained in force. The president signed the executive order days after he said the only way to end the division of families was through congressional action, because “you can’t do it through an executive order.” But he changed his mind after a barrage of criticism from congressional Democrats, immigration activists and even some Republicans. The increase in the number of people attempting to enter the country had become a source of frustration for the Trump administration. Some White House officials had accused the department of not doing enough to reduce the number of illegal crossings. Mr. Trump ordered thousands of National Guard troops to the border to help the Border Patrol. The troops are not allowed to take part in immigration enforcement, however. Still, despite the drop in the number of people caught trying to cross the border last month, the data suggest that thousands of men, women and children are still willing to brave the long trek from Central America to escape violent gangs and drug cartels. "
659,"WASHINGTON — The departure of Scott Pruitt, the scandal-plagued former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, means that the agency will be led in the coming months by Mr. Pruitt’s deputy, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who shares Mr. Pruitt’s zeal to undo environmental regulations. But unlike Mr. Pruitt — who had come to Washington as an outsider and aspiring politician, only to get caught up in a swirl of controversy over his costly first-class travel and security spending — Mr. Wheeler is viewed as a consummate Washington insider who avoids the limelight and has spent years effectively navigating the rules. For that reason, Mr. Wheeler’s friends and critics alike say, he could ultimately prove to be more adept than his controversial former boss in the job. “Many worry Wheeler will be more effective at implementing Trump’s anti-environmental agenda than Pruitt was,” said Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, in the wake of the departure. On Thursday afternoon, President Trump tweeted that he had accepted Mr. Pruitt’s resignation and that Mr. Wheeler would take over as acting director of the agency. Mr. Wheeler is expected to serve in an acting capacity as head of the E.P.A. until President Trump nominates a new agency chief, who must then be confirmed by the Senate. That process could take months and potentially stretch past the November midterm elections. "

Here’s what you need to know: • Ticking down to a trade war. The Trump administration is set to impose tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese products, setting off a potentially devastating clash between the world’s two largest economies. The penalties, which go into effect at 12:01 a.m. Eastern, are expected to bring immediate retaliation from Beijing: taxes on an equal amount of U.S. exports, including pork, soybeans, steel and peanuts. American metal producers in the Rust Belt, the energy sector and automakers are worried. The dispute is expected to ripple through global supply chains. Global stock markets have been volatile in anticipation of a trade fight between the U.S. and almost everyone else. _____ • “Fire and fury” no more. When North Korea conducted missile tests and detonated atomic bombs last year, President Trump responded with threats and ordered the military to come up with pre-emptive strike options. "
661,"Bill Shine, the former Fox News executive who was pushed out over his handling of sexual harassment scandals at the network, was named the White House deputy chief of staff for communications on Thursday. The move formalizes a job that Mr. Shine has been in since earlier this week, according to White House officials. With no vacant office to work in yet, Mr. Shine has been occupying a desk outside the principal deputy press secretary’s office, the officials said. Mr. Shine had been in talks with President Trump about a job since the spring, even playing golf with the president and Sean Hannity, the Fox News host and one of Mr. Shine’s close friends. But Mr. Shine had been uncertain that he wanted to make himself a target for fresh scrutiny, people who had talked with him at the time said. Since then, the communications job has evolved into a position that reports directly to the president, overseeing both the press and communications teams. Mr. Trump has made the communications team a target of his ire throughout his time in office, and Mr. Shine is expected to help revamp it. Mr. Shine’s title is also assistant to the president, though his other duties remain unclear. He declined to comment for this article. Mr. Shine “brings over two decades of television programming, communications, and management experience to the role,” the White House said in a statement announcing the appointment. Some close to the White House expect Mr. Shine to serve as an extension of Mr. Hannity, giving him additional insight into the administration. Mr. Shine was never accused of harassment himself. But his boss, Roger E. Ailes, was, and Mr. Shine was accused in lawsuits of turning a blind eye to a climate that was hostile toward women. Mr. Shine’s hiring has been protested by some conservatives. The website Newsmax, run by Christopher Ruddy, a Trump ally, published an article last week raising questions about the wisdom of bringing Mr. Shine on board given his Fox News baggage. "
662,"WASHINGTON — President Trump will speak one-on-one with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia this month when they meet in Helsinki, Finland, the administration confirmed Thursday, injecting an element of unpredictability and mystery into an encounter that White House advisers describe as a chance to reset a tense relationship. Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the United States envoy to Moscow, said Mr. Trump would use the meeting to “continue to hold Russia accountable for its malign activities,” including Mr. Putin’s election meddling and his military incursion into Ukraine. The leaders also are expected to discuss arms control and the conflict in Syria. But there is no telling what Mr. Trump — a president who abhors long briefing papers and often disregards or defies the advice of his advisers — will choose to say while he is alone with Mr. Putin, a prospect that puts some of his aides and experienced diplomats inside and outside the government on edge. “Putin is very clever in giving a distorted and self-serving version of history on some of these substantive issues,” said Alexander Vershbow, a former United States ambassador to Russia. “He can charm Trump into changing his position or dropping longstanding U.S. positions if he’s alone with him for too long.” At a campaign rally on Thursday in Great Falls, Mont., Mr. Trump dismissed the concerns about the upcoming meeting, mocking skeptics for noting that Mr. Putin is a former chief of Russia’s feared intelligence service. “‘You know, President Putin is K.G.B.,’ and this and that,” Mr. Trump said, affecting a serious voice. “You know what? Putin’s fine. He’s fine. We’re all fine. We’re people. Will I be prepared? Totally prepared. I’ve been preparing for this stuff my whole life.” "

664,"SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge in California on Thursday denied a request by the Trump administration to suspend California’s so-called sanctuary policies that limit cooperation between federal immigration authorities and state and local law enforcement. In a decision praised by opponents of the Trump administration’s immigration policies, Judge John A. Mendez of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California ruled that the state’s decision not to assist in federal immigration enforcement was not an “obstacle.” “Standing aside does not equate to standing in the way,” the judge wrote in a 60-page ruling that was at times impassioned. Judge Mendez described the case as presenting “unique and novel” questions about the balance in the country between state and federal powers. “The Court must answer the complicated question of where the United States’ enumerated power over immigration ends and California’s reserved police power begins,” the judge said.

Is that now changing? When asked last week if the Fed might undermine the economy with too many interest rate increases, Larry Kudlow, the director of President Trump’s National Economic Council, said he hoped the central bank would “move very slowly.” Last month, Fed policymakers signaled that they may make four interest rate increases this year, up from the three they previously expected. That means the Fed could raise rates two more times this year, and three next, according to the policymakers’ indications. Mr. Kudlow’s remarks could be construed as a signal that the White House does not want those increases to come quickly. That the president’s top economic adviser expressed an opinion on monetary policy might not seem controversial, especially when so many other economic matters are up for discussion. But it had become something of a norm for the White House to refrain from questioning the Fed. The central bank has the power to influence the economy like no other government entity. Presidents in the past leaned on the Fed to rev up growth ahead of elections, sometimes causing havoc later. Such messes persuaded White House officials to back off, and in the last two decades they have largely left the Fed to do its job. But now, with President Trump questioning so much of the existing economic order and sometimes breaking protocol, as he did last month when signaling strong jobs numbers before their release, investors and others are on the lookout for any encroachment on the Fed’s autonomy.

667,"To the Editor: Re “Mired in Scandal, Pruitt Is Forced to Exit E.P.A. Post” (front page, July 6): The long-awaited, good-riddance departure of Scott Pruitt as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will justifiably be applauded by everyone who values what he opposes. Mr. Pruitt’s tenure, which was tarnished by a seemingly endless stream of ethics violations, likely ended only because these revelations reached a point where President Trump, who constantly heaped praise on Mr. Pruitt, concluded that his own image was at risk. Scott Pruitt lasted as long as he did in his job because he was fulfilling the mission he was charged with by his boss — the dismantling of environmental protection by reversing four decades of successes at the agency he was appointed to lead. This will no doubt define his legacy and that of his boss. Ethics violations, for all their outrage, may well prove to be a footnote. ROGER HIRSCHBERG
BONDVILLE, VT. To the Editor: The corrupt activities of Scott Pruitt point out a serious weakness in the staffing of leadership positions in government agencies and departments. As a retired career scientist at the Environmental Protection Agency, I can say confidently that it should be possible to throw a stick at any E.P.A. staff meeting and hit someone better qualified than Mr. Pruitt to head the agency. It is a good thing for all of us that he is gone from the E.P.A. Unfortunately, his desk and “cone of silence” will now be occupied by one of his equally unqualified cronies as interim administrator. Senior career government employees are skilled and dedicated. They know the history and objectives of the organization better than anyone. They live their careers within the strict legal and ethical requirements of government employment. The idea that they need to be regularly “led” by uninformed political appointees is ridiculous. That these appointees are at liberty to fill important senior staff positions with their political allies is shameful. How much better it would be to have capable and experienced public servants in charge. Appointees like Mr. Pruitt tarnish the good name of government service everywhere. It is time that the rules are changed, and agency heads are selected from the ranks of career staff. RICHARD W. POETON
BENNINGTON, VT. To the Editor: Lest environmentalists cheer at Scott Pruitt’s departure, let us remember that when President Trump fired Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, he replaced a former Exxon Mobil chief executive with the oil-industry shill Mike Pompeo. Our only hope lies in The Times’s prediction that the process for nominating and confirming Mr. Pruitt’s successor “could take months and potentially stretch past the November midterm elections.” In the meantime, we need to do everything we can to elect a Congress that recognizes, rather than ridicules, the dangers we face from human-induced climate change.

668,"In Bill Shine, President Trump has turned to a man who was well-regarded for his ratings success as a top Fox News executive, but who carries the weight of accusations that he helped cover up sexual harassment scandals at the network. The administration announced on Thursday that Mr. Shine had been hired as the White House deputy chief of staff for communications. At Fox News, he was considered a reliable right-hand man to Roger Ailes, the network’s former chairman, who left in 2016 after being accused of sexual harassment. [Read about President Trump’s appointment of Mr. Shine.] His close relationship to Mr. Ailes made Mr. Shine inseparable from the network’s spate of harassment lawsuits, and several women accused him of working to silence complaints and enable the chairman’s behavior. He has largely avoided the spotlight that follows other media executives, having done few on-the-record interviews. Here’s what we do know about him. After college, Mr. Shine worked for local stations on Long Island. He began his tenure at Fox News 20 years ago as a producer for “Hannity & Colmes,” the show that pitted Alan Colmes, a liberal, against Sean Hannity, a conservative who has become the network’s top star. Mr. Shine quickly earned the trust of Mr. Ailes and was put in charge of Greta Van Susteren’s prime-time show when she was poached from CNN in 2002. Ms. Van Susteren and Mr. Hannity were among the top Fox News personalities who became close to Mr. Shine and credit him with their ratings success. "
669,"We all have it wrong, or at least we’re all being too literal. With Scott Pruitt’s exit, the Trump administration isn’t saying goodbye to the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. It’s losing its mascot. Just as a giant duck represents the University of Oregon and Duke has its blue devil, Donald Trump had Pruitt, who was less a steward of breathable air than an emblem of ethical rot. He was one-stop shopping for the gaudy marriage of unprofessionalism and amorality that defines this presidency. He gave that union a mystifyingly smiley face. Put Ritz-Carlton moisturizer on it. Then flew it first-class to Rome. It fell to Pruitt to embody the entire Trump ethos — grab what you can, exploit your insider status, lift nepotism to an art form and carom through the corridors of power with flashing lights and screaming sirens — in one heedless, shameless bureaucrat. He took this assignment seriously, and aced it. Which is why it’s sort of sad to see him go. Sort of surprising, too. Why quit when you’ve already endured all the mortification that he has? Why not crawl, in your reduced and pitiable form, to the finish line and at least get points for stamina? It’s not as if Pruitt is saving himself from exposure as a fun-size Trump-in-training. It’s not as if he can keep those true colors hidden. They’re vivid and ugly and indelible, and came out somewhere on the timeline between the construction of a $43,000 soundproof booth for his most important calls and his insistence that aides pick up his dry cleaning, find out about the procurement of a used mattress from the Trump International Hotel in Washington, look into the acquisition of a Chick-fil-A franchise for his wife, and retroactively delete official events on his calendar that he didn’t want remembered for posterity. Several of these errands may actually constitute federal crimes. Yes, I know, he wasn’t really the one who decided that the jig was up, and when we’re told that President Trump “accepted the resignation” that Pruitt tendered, it’s laughable code for the president’s telling him not to let the phone booth’s door hit him on the way out.

671,"Michael D. Cohen, the former personal lawyer to President Trump who is under investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan, has hired Lanny J. Davis, the Washington lawyer and public relations consultant best known for serving in the Clinton White House, to represent him. The pairing is unusual. Mr. Davis has tried to position himself as a key defender of Bill and Hillary Clinton — particularly Mrs. Clinton, whom Mr. Trump defeated in the 2016 presidential election and continues to attack as “totally crooked.” Mr. Cohen was once a fierce defender of Mr. Trump. The president’s allies have long considered the wide-ranging corruption investigation into Mr. Cohen and his business dealings to pose an even more imminent threat to the president than the special counsel investigation. Mr. Davis said he was persuaded to join the legal team after Mr. Cohen said in an interview with ABC News that aired this week that his first allegiance was to his family and to his country, not to the president. “Like most of America, I have been following the matter regarding Michael Cohen with great interest,” Mr. Davis said in a statement. “As an attorney, I have talked to Michael many times in the last two weeks. Then I read his words published on July 2, and I recognized his sincerity.” He added, “Michael Cohen deserves to tell his side of the story — subject, of course, to the advice of counsel.” Mr. Cohen did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Davis is expected to join Guy Petrillo, a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan, in representing Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen has made moves to separate himself from Mr. Trump, stripping his Twitter profile of reference to the president. And he has told people he is preparing for an onslaught from prosecutors, who have been poring over documents seized in raids on his home and office, and a public relations onslaught from Mr. Trump’s associates, who have indicated they will raise questions about Mr. Cohen’s credibility. However, they have said to allies that they will go after him only if Mr. Cohen strikes first and have indicated they want to avoid provoking him. Mr. Cohen has told allies that he no longer wants to be the “villain” in the narrative about Mr. Trump’s behavior. Mr. Davis wrote a book arguing that the election was stolen from Mrs. Clinton by the actions of James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director who oversaw the investigation into her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. The Clintons have made the argument to allies. "

WASHINGTON — Before he resigned on Thursday, Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, was facing new questions about whether aides deleted sensitive information about his meetings from his public schedule and potentially violated the law in doing so. Last summer one of his senior schedulers, Madeline G. Morris, was fired by Mr. Pruitt’s former deputy chief of staff, Kevin Chmielewski, who said he let her go because she was questioning the practice of retroactively deleting meetings from the calendar. Mr. Chmielewski has emerged as a harsh critic of Mr. Pruitt after a bitter falling out that led to his departure from the agency as well. Ms. Morris, who started work as Mr. Pruitt’s scheduler in June 2017, confirmed Wednesday that she was fired after she raised objections about the deletions, which she believed were illegal, although she said that Mr. Chmielewski did not tell her his reasons for firing her. One case involved the deletion of several of Mr. Pruitt’s meetings during a spring 2017 trip to Rome, including one with a controversial cardinal then under investigation for sexual assault. President Trump announced on Thursday that Mr. Pruitt, who had been the subject of numerous investigations into claims that he used agency resources for personal benefit, had resigned. The E.P.A. acknowledged in a series of legal memos last year that it did in fact direct an agency scheduler — although it did not name the person — to revise Mr. Pruitt’s daily calendar retroactively. The agency said it was doing so to remove errors that had been left in the electronic record after various events were canceled or happened differently than expected. "

674,"Nearly lost in the uproar surrounding an intensifying trade war and a series of tiffs with longstanding American allies was President Trump’s startling suggestion last month that he’s really a free-trader at heart. “You want a tariff-free, you want no barriers, and you want no subsidies, because you have some cases where countries are subsidizing industries, and that’s not fair,” he said at the Group of 7 meeting in Quebec. “So you go tariff-free, you go barrier-free, you go subsidy-free. That’s the way you learned at the Wharton School of finance. I mean, that would be the ultimate thing.” But he also lamented that the United States is “a piggy bank everybody is robbing,” spurned the G-7’s joint communiqué that rejected protectionism, and is imposing tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese exports, all signs that he’s actually moving in the opposite direction. But let’s take his statement at face value. “If Trump is serious about zero tariffs, then let’s make it part of the agenda,” said Edwin J. Feulner, founder and former president of the conservative Heritage Foundation. “I’d be all for it.” Mr. Trump is correct that economists at Wharton, and at just about every other reputable business school, teach the virtues of free trade. It is one of the few propositions that unites economists across the political spectrum. (Its opponents are also odd allies: the populist, nationalist right and the anti-free-market left.) “If President Trump would seriously say we want a comprehensive agreement reducing trade barriers among the G-7, there would be a lot of support for that,” said Joshua Meltzer, a senior fellow and specialist in international trade at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution.

At the end of the proceeding, she raised her right fist, drawing applause from supporters in the courtroom. Outside the courthouse, Ms. Okoumou cited the words of former first lady Michelle Obama: “‘When they go low, we go high,’ and I went as high as I could,” she told supporters. She called the decision to climb “spur of the moment.” Ms. Okoumou said she emigrated from the Republic of Congo to the United States in 1994, and her lawyer said she is a naturalized citizen. She began scaling the base of the statue shortly after 3 p.m. on one of the monument’s busiest days of the year. The Statue of Liberty typically draws more than 20,000 visitors for the Independence Day holiday, according to the National Park Service. Ms. Okoumou’s standoff with the authorities was shown live on television. After she refused orders to come down, members of the New York Police Department’s Emergency Service Unit climbed up and escorted her down at around 6:30 p.m. "
676,"DALZELL, S.C. — As a teenager growing up in rural Sumter County, Brian Benenhaley resented the white people who looked down on his dark-skinned father. The resentment fueled his ambition, and he took a certain satisfaction, on high school awards nights, in bringing his father the trophies and plaques he had won. “I’d give them to my dad, and watch some of the white folk have to come by and acknowledge that your boy did O.K., or maybe even a little better than O.K.,” said Mr. Benenhaley, 44, who is now a corporate lawyer based in Columbia, the state capital. Such stories of pride and prejudice are common among nonwhite people in the Deep South. But Mr. Benenhaley belongs to an uncommon tranche of the population, one that never fell neatly into the region’s old racial binary. Based on little more than oral tradition, they call themselves Turks, and have long claimed to be a kind of “white folk” themselves; indeed, they have been known to harbor their own prejudices. Mr. Benenhaley said his father, who died in 2013, would have been scandalized if his sister had dated a black boy. Even so, people in Sumter County have long considered the Turks, who have never numbered more than a few hundred, to be in a racial category of their own, a cluster of insular, dark-complexioned families suspended in the tricky Southern space between white and nonwhite — and, some would say, between fact and legend. For much of the 20th century, the authorities in Sumter County treated them that way, too: they were segregated into Turkish public schools, Turkish theater seats and Turkish hospital beds. But because the Turks traced their ancestry to a man described as “Caucasian of ‘Arab’ descent,” they were allowed to vote in the age of Jim Crow. "
677,"RE: STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS Ruth Padawer wrote about time-limiting laws that prevent hundreds of sexual-assault cases from being prosecuted. Ruth Padawer offers a compelling and disturbing account of the costs that statutes of limitations impose on rape victims. I would add another to those that she discusses. As Padawer notes, most victims fall prey to a rapist they know and then find the criminal-justice system unresponsive. Too many prosecutors and judges continue to regard acquaintance rape as a minor offense that rarely happens and about which women routinely lie by “crying rape.” With #MeToo and #BelieveWomen, though, this may soon change. Misogyny’s role in guiding acquaintance-rape cases may recede with the understanding that a victim’s testimony is not part of a “swearing contest” but is an eyewitness account of a credible person. The denial of an accused rapist, by contrast, is entitled to little evidentiary weight as it is fully explained by a desire to avoid conviction. When the system begins to treat prosecutors’ eyewitnesses in date-rape cases with the same respect as it does eyewitnesses to other crimes, it would be a shame if statutes of limitations stood in the way of finally achieving justice. Sherry F. Colb, Professor of Law and Charles Evans Hughes Scholar, Cornell Law School A key piece in a victim’s reluctance to report a rape is distrust — her account is not believed. That’s what happened to me when I was assaulted. For someone to accuse me of lying or making up such a vicious act was a different kind of deep hurt and betrayal. My heart sank when I read that the police thought the wrapped pantyhose around Ms. Palomba’s wrists was a “stage prop” and that she should be arrested for reporting a fake crime. Even though I moved on with my life, I never felt completely safe after the assault, largely because the evil creature was never apprehended, coupled with the fact that there is a statute of limitations on this heinous crime. To this day, I loathe the darkness and always leave lights on in every room in my house, even when my husband is home. That fear never goes away. What’s the real harm in eliminating this statute? At the very least, it could offer a sense of relief and hope that possibly one day the horrible person who stole my sense of security would be caught and held accountable for the irrevocable damage he inflicted. I think if the majority of individuals who would consider and vote on removing this statute of limitations were women, it would pass and would have passed years ago. Marge Keller, Midwest "
678,"SYDNEY, Australia — The Australian government will allow a young girl to leave an offshore detention center on the Pacific island nation of Nauru and seek medical care in Australia, the latest in a series of refugee children who have asked to be let into the country for treatment. The decision came just before a federal court hearing on Wednesday at which lawyers for the girl’s family planned to argue that she be brought to Australia immediately. She has serious mental health issues and is likely to leave for Australia on Friday, according to The Guardian Australia. The girl, whose name and age have not been disclosed, is at least the seventh seriously ill child to be brought to Australia under legal pressure since the Nauru center reopened in 2012, according to the National Justice Project, a nonprofit legal service that has represented most of them, including the girl on Wednesday. The seven children include one girl in February and a 10-year-old boy in March who were considered to be at risk of killing themselves. Under current Australian immigration policy, asylum-seekers and refugees who reach Australia by boat are forbidden to enter, in a bid by the government to discourage dangerous ocean crossings and human trafficking. Instead, they have been sent for processing on Nauru and Manus Island, which is part of Papua New Guinea. The Manus Island center was closed last October amid protests from its inhabitants, who said they feared being attacked by local residents. "

680,"I’m willing to take at face value the declaration by Senator Susan Collins of Maine that a Supreme Court nominee who showed “hostility” to Roe v. Wade, the foundational abortion-rights precedent, “would not be acceptable” to her. It’s an important statement, coming from one of the vanishingly small group of Republican senators who might break with party discipline and make their own judgment about President Trump’s soon-to-be-named nominee. But here’s the question: If hostility to the Supreme Court’s 1973 precedent is a deal-breaker for Ms. Collins, how will she learn what the nominee really thinks? How will we the people know? The Senate confirmation process has become so degraded that to call it a joke is way too kind. When I wrote last year that Neil Gorsuch appeared to be the least forthcoming Supreme Court nominee in modern history, that conclusion was based on my own observation rather than statistical analysis. Now two scholars of the confirmation process, Lori A. Ringhand and Paul M. Collins Jr., have proved me right in a statistics-driven law review article forthcoming in the Chicago-Kent Law Review. Going back to 1939, when Felix Frankfurter, then a Harvard law professor, became the first Supreme Court nominee to answer questions in public and under oath, the authors identified only one nominee less responsive than Justice Gorsuch. That was Justice Abe Fortas during his 1968 confirmation hearing for his elevation to chief justice, a nomination that failed. With the future of the court — indeed, of the Constitution as we know it — now at stake, it’s urgent for the senators and the public to understand that Justice Gorsuch’s stonewalling of the Judiciary Committee was not consistent with historical practice and should not be viewed as a norm. Rather, it should be called out for what it was: a derogation of the democratic principle at the heart of Article III of the Constitution, the judiciary article that places the confirmation of life-tenured judicial nominees in the hands of the people’s representatives. Until recently, the modern confirmation process has assumed at least a modicum of substantive engagement between those representatives and the nominee. Justice Gorsuch and his senatorial enablers based the claim that it would somehow be unethical for him to discuss his own views about the Constitution on something he and others referred to as the “Ginsburg rule.” Supposedly, during her 1993 confirmation hearing, then-Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg refused to give meaningful answers to the senators’ questions. That is a myth. As the current documentary film “RBG” reminds us, she fully embraced the constitutional right to abortion. She was confirmed by a vote of 96 to 3. "
681,"For years, I’ve held onto a memo that a professional mentor gave me around 1990, a typewritten document by the pollster Stanley Greenberg with the title “Kids as Politics.” Mr. Greenberg, who has shown the sharpest understanding of traditionally Democratic voters drawn to the appeal of Ronald Reagan then or Donald Trump today, argued that a political agenda centered on children could not only improve kids’ lives but also open the door to a broader liberalism and to Democrats more generally; kid-centered politics would help Americans “rediscover government.” Politics centered on children went beyond a few federal programs. “When candidates talk about kids,” Mr. Greenberg wrote, “they are talking about the fundamental economic and social terrain on which Democrats must run.” Mr. Greenberg’s memo, now more than 30 years old, is strikingly relevant to the current moment. The practice of separating children from their parents at the border galvanized a level of outrage, including among prominent Republicans, that exceeds even the protests spurred by Mr. Trump’s travel ban early in his term.  As part of Mr. Trump’s move to chip away at the enormous federal deficit by cutting money already allocated by Congress — the “rescissions” battle  — he has proposed slashing support for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, one of the most consistently popular federal programs since its creation in 1997. Whether Democrats choose the path or not, children are likely to be at the center of political fights in 2018 and beyond. In the Reagan era, the idea of a political vision centered on children influenced many Democrats and some Republicans, including conservatives. As Democratic governor of Arizona, Bruce Babbitt declared 1985 “The Year of the Child,” earning mockery from The Arizona Republic for offering voters “quiche” rather than the “meat and potatoes” of Arizona politics, such as water rights and economic development. (A book called “Real Men Don’t Eat Quiche” was popular in the mid-1980s.) A National Commission on Children was started, where liberals and social conservatives such as Kay Coles James, now president of the Heritage Foundation, found common ground on an ambitious agenda that included a child tax credit and the children’s health program that Mr. Trump now proposes to cut. While the commission’s 1991 recommendations were widely derided as overly ambitious, most of them were enacted within a few years. Kid-centered politics, in its first phase, was quite successful — at least if judged by the standards of whether it helped create programs that improved life for children, established some basis for bipartisan consensus, and in a few cases gave politicians an issue to run on. CHIP funding, for example, was a winning issue for Democrats in both the 2006 and 2008 elections, and restoring funding for the children’s health program was one of Barack Obama’s first moves in the White House. Between 1980 and 2010, funding for children’s programs more than tripled, in current dollars, according to the Urban Institute’s annual “Kids’ Share” report. "
682,"Just hours after Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement, media legal analysts and commentators began forecasting what this will mean for women’s reproductive freedom. On CNN: “Roe v. Wade is doomed.” Huffington Post: “It’s time to prepare for life without nationwide legal abortion.” Reuters: “a death knell for Roe v. Wade.” Or, as one commenter remarked, invoking Dylan, “looks like it’s all over now, baby blue.” I share the despair, but have we forgotten something? Republicans have a one-vote majority in the Senate. Their number includes two female moderates, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, both of whom support abortion rights, and one of whom — Ms. Collins — has already declared this week that she would not support a candidate hostile to Roe v. Wade. A no vote from these two senators might not be enough to offset affirmative votes from endangered red-state Democrats. And the attack on Roe may be pursued through a host of more subtle and incremental assaults, not an out-and-out declared repeal. To save Roe, Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski might need to wield a bigger stick. Fortunately, there’s one at hand, and wielding it at this pivotal moment might do good beyond the single issue. They could bolt their party and shift the balance of power in the Senate. Since 1890, 21 senators have switched party affiliation during their time in office, some for matters of conscience, some to advance careers. In 2001, when the Senate was split 50-50, Jim Jeffords renounced his Republican membership to become an independent aligned with the Democrats, flipping control of the chamber. Arlen Specter, the last senator to switch party affiliations, became a Democrat again in 2009 for the same reason he became a Republican in 1965: he couldn’t get elected otherwise. Mr. Specter’s was an act of self-preservation. Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski have an opportunity for a principled act of national preservation. By leaving the G.O.P. — either to join the other party or, more plausibly, to become independents and caucus with the Democrats — Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski wouldn’t simply be registering their opposition to a single Supreme Court justice. They’d be taking a powerful stand against their party’s escalating betrayals of the country. The Trump-era Republicans have made screamingly clear what should have been obvious for a long time: The G.O.P. is no longer a comfortable home for anyone who cares about the rights of women — or of minorities, immigrants, L.G.B.T. people, and the poor — or about the Constitution. Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski could drop the pretense that dissenting within the party has made one bit of “moderating” difference. Defection would come at a cost. Both senators would lose precious seniority and powerful committee appointments. But accommodations can be made, and neither necessarily needs the Republican Party to win re-election. Ms. Murkowski, famously, ran and was elected in 2010 despite her party, which chose as its nominee a hard-line anti-abortion Tea Party zealot. “I am very cognizant of how I was returned to the Senate,” she said. “It was not my party that returned me. It was voters across the spectrum that returned me.” "
683,"Good Thursday. Wan this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. More than $2.5 trillion in deals were announced during the first half of the year, putting M.&.A. in 2018 on pace to surpass $5 trillion. That would be the largest yearly total on record. DealBook’s Stephen Grocer has some insights on those numbers, including: • Many of the biggest deals, particularly those in the media business, are bids to fend off competition from tech companies. • Cross-border deals totaled $1 trillion, despite trade tensions — though it could be too early for that rancor to have an effect. • The largest portion of deals are takeovers of American companies. There’s also a warning: Other recent peaks in merger activity have been followed by a recession. Potential trade wars, regulatory uncertainty and rising interest rates could mean this boom will end the same way. More M.&A. news: Deal makers’s paydays should be more closely tied to whether the transactions they put together work out in the long run, the FT’s John Gapper argues. "
684,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. President Trump and Congressional Republicans aren’t giving up on their attempts to take health insurance away from millions of Americans. Here’s a quick guide to their efforts: • A coalition of conservative groups, including the Heritage Foundation and others, recently released a new repeal plan. It’s similar to last year’s Cassidy-Graham bill. It would reverse Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion and end protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Various Trump administration officials — including Alex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services — claim the bill wouldn’t hurt people with pre-existing conditions, but those claims are simply untrue. At least 20 million people would likely lose coverage if the new Republican plan becomes law, estimate Aviva Aron-Dine and Matt Broaddus of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The White House praised the plan, as Mary Ellen McIntire of CQ Now noted. If Republicans keep control of Congress in this year’s midterm election, they are likely to make a new run at passing a plan along these lines next year. Every single Republican health care plan drafted so far would deprive a large number of people of insurance coverage and raise costs for many others. The main point of the plans, in fact, is to reduce federal spending on health care — largely to reduce taxes on the affluent. Health care is very much on the ballot this year. • In the meantime, the Trump administration continues to take steps to weaken Obamacare through executive action. Its boldest attempt is its decision to stop defending the law against a lawsuit filed by some Republican state officials. That attempt seems unlikely to succeed in the long run, given that both conservative and liberal legal experts have criticized it, Aron-Dine told me. But if it did succeed, she added, it would be catastrophic. It would repeal much of the private-market part of the law, leaving only the Medicaid expansion fully in place. A second sabotage attempt is less ambitious — but more certain to do at least some damage. Last month, the Trump administration announced it would expand so-called short-term insurance plans, which aren’t subject to minimum coverage requirements. Some number of (currently) healthy people will sign up for these bare-bones plans, raising costs for everyone. And, of course, if those healthy people end up getting sick, they may regret having signed on. The administration will likely announce the details on these short-term plans in the coming weeks. The bottom line: The recent expansion of Medicaid in Virginia was a major piece of good news on health care. Thirty-three states have now expanded Medicaid as part of Obamacare, and other states, like Nebraska and Utah, may soon follow. But all of this progress is in danger if Republicans keep control of Congress. "
685,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) After a trip across the United States that included a stop at Skid Row in Los Angeles, a United Nations official remarked that “contrasts between private wealth and public squalor abound.” Another U.N. official said after a visit, “You almost forget you are in Los Angeles.” The L.A. Times has called the explosion of homelessness in Los Angeles in recent years “a national disgrace,” and Mayor Eric Garcetti has said the issue is “the moral crisis of our time.” To give readers a visual understanding of what that looks like across the city, as extreme wealth and poverty collide in public spaces, including libraries, parks and beaches, we went on a tour across the county, and published this piece. In an age of growing economic inequality, the well-off have been able to seclude themselves away from the impoverished. But that has changed over the years in Los Angeles, as the growth in the homeless population has forced the rich and poor to interact more often. Rigo Veloso, who had been homeless in Malibu before moving into an apartment on a resident’s ranch, said that many people he encountered while living on the streets were friendly and compassionate, but many others, he said, “would judge you, and not treat you like a human being.” “It takes your dignity away,” he said. “I’ve been called a maggot.” Indeed, as local authorities grapple with how to spend millions of dollars on housing and other services for the homeless, community leaders are also trying to address the issue at the most basic human level, urging residents to say hello and make eye contact with those living on the streets. “If you talk to most homeless people they will say one of the hardest things is they felt invisible,” said John Maceri, executive director of The People Concern, a social services agency that helps homeless people. “It is dehumanizing. You don’t have to give money to say hello to people, to acknowledge them.” "
686,"With tariffs driving up the price of stainless steel, the precision-part manufacturer Accu-Swiss in Oakdale, Calif., came up with a plan to save money: turn off the lights but keep the machines on. “We are being hurt because of the cost increase,” said Sohel Sareshwala, the company’s owner and president. To squeeze more output from existing equipment, he is “running the machines in a lights-out operation.” After his regular 10-person staff leaves for the day at 6 p.m., Mr. Sareshwala said, the plant is experimenting with slowing down the machines and letting them run unattended for four more hours. For large and small businesses around the nation, the impact of tariffs is expected to grow on Friday, after the Trump administration placed additional duties on $34 billion of Chinese products, many used in American manufacturing. China had said it would respond immediately with sanctions of its own. Mr. Sareshwala is among a growing number of importers and exporters departing from business as usual because of the gathering storm of trade sanctions. The 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum that President Trump first threatened in March and put into effect in June precipitated a string of retaliatory tariffs from China and other trading partners including Germany, Mexico and Canada. Mr. Trump has said that in the long run, the tariffs will save jobs in the protected industries, and safeguard national security. But many businesses in other sectors, including apple growers in Washington, hog farmers in Minnesota and Harley-Davidson in Wisconsin, are scrambling to adjust. "
687,"In the Italian film “Life Is Beautiful,” a Jewish bookstore owner uses creative stunts to distract his child from the horrible reality of being held in a Nazi concentration camp. I was reminded of that movie recently as I found myself part of an eerily similar heartbreaking moment. As lawyers with the Texas Civil Rights Project, my team has been working around the clock to document hundreds of cases of children taken from their parents since the Trump administration started its “zero tolerance” immigration policy. Under that policy, the government charges every immigrant apprehended at the border with illegal entry, a misdemeanor offense — regardless of whether they’re fleeing violence and seeking asylum, or traveling with children. Before zero tolerance, immigration and Department of Justice officials exercised their discretion on whether to press criminal charges against some immigrants and asylum seekers, particularly those traveling with children and those with special circumstances. Each morning for the last three weeks, my colleagues and I have gone to the federal courthouse in McAllen, Tex., seven miles from the Mexican border. We arrive no later than 7:45, pass the metal detectors at the security check, and make sure to get to the eighth floor by 8. By that time, the courtroom is already nearly full. On a typical morning, some 70 to 80 men and women are brought to court and put in handcuffs with shackles around their ankles. A vast majority are first-time border crossers. A public defender asks the group whether any are traveling with children and have been separated from them. Struggling with the handcuffs, it’s not easy for them to raise their hands. Sometimes, to answer in the affirmative, they must stand up. The criminal proceeding begins at 9 a.m., and depending on how many separated parents are there each day, we have maybe five to seven minutes to speak with each parent beforehand. Hopefully, that’s enough to get the most basic information about them and the children taken from them — names, dates of birth, country of origin. They’re frightened and confused, and most don’t speak English. I tell them in Spanish that I’m a lawyer working on family separations and that I can try to help get their children back. "
688,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has drafted a new proposal to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, one that is far less stringent than the climate plan finalized in 2015 by former President Barack Obama. In writing the new rule to replace Mr. Obama’s Clean Power Plan, the Trump administration is essentially accepting, for now, that the federal government is legally obligated to take action to address the greenhouse gases that cause global warming, even as President Trump has dismissed established climate science. But the new proposal is likely to spur only small tweaks to the nation’s energy system. Details of the plan, which is being drafted by the Environmental Protection Agency and is expected to be sent to the White House for approval in coming days, were described to The New York Times by industry officials who have worked closely with the agency to shape the rule. On Thursday, Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the E.P.A., submitted his resignation after facing 13 federal investigations into his ethics, spending and management practices. That move is unlikely to lead to a major policy shift at the agency: The new acting E.P.A. chief will be Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who shares Mr. Pruitt’s commitment to rolling back Obama-era climate policies. The new proposal, according to industry attorneys familiar with the plan, would recommend regulating the emissions of individual coal plants, which would call for modest upgrades, such as improving efficiency or substituting fuel. That contrasts with the more ambitious goals of the Clean Power Plan, which encouraged utilities to make broader systemic changes to cut emissions, such as switching from coal to natural gas or renewable power. Allison D. Wood, a partner at Hunton & Williams who represents several electric utilities, described it as “very significant” that the administration was putting forward a regulation that acknowledged the obligation to regulate planet-warming emissions.

689,"To the Editor: Re “A Frosty Summer for Dershowitz on Liberal Martha’s Vineyard” (front page, July 4): Alan Dershowitz complains that “I never thought I would see McCarthyism come to Martha’s Vineyard, but I have” — because he is being shunned by some people on the Vineyard for expressing views that support President Trump. It is an insult to the pernicious virulence and exceptional odiousness of McCarthyism for Mr. Dershowitz, the lawyer and professor emeritus at Harvard Law School, to compare his mild experience to it. No one is making false allegations against him or accusing him without evidence of treachery. No one is threatening to imprison him if he doesn’t denounce his friends. No one is denying him a living or threatening to harm him. What these people in Chilmark, Mass., are doing is disapproving of his chosen activities, which is their right and perhaps their obligation. They merely stopped socializing with him. He’ll live. MICHAEL PARLEY, NEW YORK To the Editor: Alan Dershowitz has been an excellent lawyer and has given brilliant commentary on legal issues for decades. His statement — “I never thought I would see McCarthyism come to Martha’s Vineyard, but I have” — is so tone deaf that it’s hard to believe that he would say it on the record. Mr. Dershowitz, it is hard to empathize with your plight when there are still families at our border whose parents can’t locate their children. What a perfect metaphor you have given us for inequality in America in 2018. ELLIOTT MILLER, BALA CYNWYD, PA. "
690,"Boeing said on Thursday that it planned to take over the commercial jet business of the Brazilian aerospace company Embraer, a move into smaller jetliners that mirrors a deal last fall by rival Airbus to join in a partnership with Bombardier. Boeing would own 80 percent of Embraer’s commercial aircraft and services arm, which the companies said was worth $4.75 billion. Embraer would own the rest. Under the memorandum of understanding announced by both companies, management would be based in Brazil, but the venture will be controlled by Boeing, which is based in Chicago. The companies also said that they would form another joint venture focused on “new markets and applications for defense products and services,” such as Embraer’s KC-390 military transport plane. The two companies have collaborated on projects for decades and have been in talks since last year on a partnership for planes with 70 to more than 450 seats and for freighters. Embraer is one of the largest producers of so-called regional aircraft, which seat 70 to 130 passengers. In May, American Airlines signed a $705 million contract for 15 E175 jets from Embraer to be delivered next year. Boeing’s smallest advertised plane, a version of the 737, seats 126 people. But Embraer’s appeal to Boeing may stem from its talent pool rather than a desire to shuttle passengers on short-hop flights, analysts said. "
691,"The unemployment rate continues to fall. The United States economy keeps adding jobs at a healthy clip. What could surprise investors about the monthly jobs report to be issued on Friday? There’s always President Trump’s Twitter feed. A month ago, Mr. Trump broke with decades of presidential protocol by commenting on the social media network that he was “looking forward to seeing the unemployment numbers.” The remark, posted about an hour before the report on May hiring was released, did not indicate what the data would show, but Mr. Trump’s decision to draw attention to the report was noticed by the community of traders who obsess over that data. Traders in the bond and currency markets were particularly quick to react. [Read more about the reactions to the message Mr. Trump posted on Twitter before the jobs report’s release last month.] When the report was released at 8:30 a.m., it showed that the United States economy had added a better-than-expected 223,000 jobs in May and that the unemployment rate had dipped to its lowest level in 18 years. Anyone who read the tea leaves via Mr. Trump’s Twitter feed might have been rewarded for placing the early trades. Bond yields, which rose after the 7:21 a.m. tweet, moved even higher after the report, for example. The White House later confirmed that Mr. Trump had been briefed on the numbers the night before, as is typical. To be clear: There is nothing unlawful with basing trades on Mr. Trump’s Twitter feed, and it is not clear if a 1985 rule that prohibits “employees of the executive branch” from commenting on the data until an hour after it is released applies to the president. But it does mean that traders will get to wonder whether an early Twitter post will become a new element in the monthly jobs day ritual. On a holiday-shortened week in the United States, the anticipation of a presidential tweet has become an “interesting sidelight” that people have an eye on, said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. “There was a movement in the market, there’s no question about that,” he said of the reaction last month, adding: “You have to see if it happens again before you say it’s something you have to pay attention to.” "
692,"WASHINGTON — A trade war between the world’s two largest economies officially began on Friday morning as the Trump administration followed through with its threat to impose tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese products, a significant escalation of a fight that could hurt companies and consumers in both the United States and China. The penalties, which went into effect at 12:01 a.m., prompted quick retaliation by Beijing, which said it immediately put its own similarly sized tariffs on American goods. Previously, the Chinese government had said it would tax pork, soybeans and automobiles, among other products China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that the United States “has launched the biggest trade war in economic history so far.” The escalation of the trade war from threat to reality is expected to ripple through global supply chains, raise costs for businesses and consumers and roil global stock markets, which have been volatile in anticipation of a prolonged trade fight between the United States and almost everyone else. On Thursday, President Trump showed no signs of backing down from his fight, saying aboard Air Force One that the first wave of tariffs on $34 billion in goods would quickly be followed by levies on another $16 billion of Chinese products. And Mr. Trump continued to threaten Beijing with escalating tariffs on as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods. For now, it is unclear how — or whether — the trade war might conclude. Mr. Trump’s threats have been met with vows from China to retaliate, a stalemate that will require one side to blink first in order to avoid a protracted fight. With no official talks scheduled between the two countries, and disagreements within the Trump administration about how best to proceed, a quick resolution seems increasingly unlikely. "
693,"Faced with a court-imposed deadline to reunite families separated at the southwest border, federal authorities are calling in volunteers to sort through records and resorting to DNA tests to match children with parents. And they acknowledged for the first time Thursday that of the nearly 3,000 children who are still in federal custody, about 100 are under the age of 5. The family separations, part of an aggressive effort by the Trump administration to deter illegal immigration, have produced a chaotic scramble as officials now face political and judicial pressure to reunite families. Records linking children to their parents have disappeared, and in some cases have been destroyed, according to two officials of the Department of Homeland Security, leaving the authorities struggling to identify connections between family members. The effort is complicated by the fact that two federal agencies are involved in detaining and sheltering migrants, and they did not initially share records with each other. On Friday, the leadership of the Department of Health and Human Services, which shelters the children and must now undertake reunifications, sent out a plea to federal public health workers for help with an exhaustive manual search of records. The agency said it needed to read through original documents of all children in federal custody “to screen whether children in our facilities were separated from parents.” That involved scrubbing the documents of an estimated 12,000 children to determine which had been separated from their parents by the authorities, as opposed to arriving in the country without a parent or other relative. “HHS is requesting volunteers over the weekend to review case records,” said one of the emails. “Everyone here is now participating in this process, including the Secretary who personally stayed until past midnight to assist.” "
694,"Nicholas Bade showed up at an Air Force recruiting office on an icy morning in January, determined to be one of the first transgender recruits to enlist in the military. He was in top shape, and had earned two martial arts black belts. He had already aced the military aptitude test, and organized the stack of medical records required to show he was stable and healthy enough to serve. So he expected to be called for basic training in a month, maybe two at the most. Six months later, he’s still waiting. And so are nearly all other transgender recruits who have tried to join up since a federal court ordered the Trump administration not to ban them from the military. The Obama administration announced a plan in 2016 for the armed services to begin accepting transgender recruits at the start of this year. But before the plan could take effect, President Trump abruptly reversed course, announcing on Twitter in July 2017 that the military would “no longer accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity,” because the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” Military leaders were given little notice of the change, which has left a wake of controversy and confusion. Civil rights groups immediately sued, claiming that a blanket ban was unconstitutional, and the courts blocked the new rules. Three federal judges hearing separate cases issued injunctions against the ban last fall that cleared the way — in theory at least — for transgender recruits to start enlisting on Jan. 1. Since then, scores have applied — but it appears almost none are being accepted. The Defense Department refused requests for statistics on transgender enlistments. But Sparta, an organization for transgender recruits, troops and veterans, says that out of its 140 members who are trying to enlist, only two have made it into the service since Jan. 1. "
695,"After years of meetings and planning, the City Council announced a ceremonial resolution last week that named a section of Flatbush “Little Haiti.” Members of the city’s Haitian community cheered and waved red and blue flags in the Council chambers in celebration. “We recognize that the Haitian population in these neighborhoods in Brooklyn is an amazing thing,” Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, said. But for many of those gathered, the ceremony was incomplete. A separate resolution was supposed to co-name Rogers Avenue between Farragut Road and Clarkson Avenue in honor of Jean-Jacques Dessalines, a former slave who was one of Haiti’s founding fathers. A fierce military leader who fought alongside Toussaint L’Ouverture, the leader of the Haitian revolt against France, Dessalines declared the nation’s independence in 1804 and named himself as emperor. Soon, fearing that the French would invade and re-enslave the population, he called for the murder of all remaining white Frenchmen. Historians believe between 3,000 to 5,000 white men, women and children were killed. The street co-naming was pulled after the City Council staff responsible for vetting street names flagged Dessalines as a possibly offensive historical figure. "
696,"Jaroslaw Kaczynski is not a man to back down. His zealous vision of a “Fourth Republic” is an idealized Catholic Poland stripped of Communist remnants and Western social liberalism. And on his second try to achieve it, he will not be deterred — not by the European Union, not by protesters, and definitely not by the courts. That is what makes his current conflict with the Supreme Court so fateful, for Poland and for Europe. The courts are an especial bugaboo for Mr. Kaczynski. When Law and Justice, the party he founded with his identical twin, Lech Kaczynski, first held power between 2005 and 2007, the courts blocked parts of their nationalist agenda. After the party was defeated in parliamentary elections — and after his brother, then president, was killed in a plane crash in Russia (which he insists was Russia’s doing) — Jaroslaw Kaczynski honed his tactics and his zeal. He did not seek office when Law and Justice retook Parliament in 2015, pushing more acceptable candidates to the fore. But he is the real power behind the government and its assault on the courts, first seizing control of the Constitutional Court, which is supposed to ensure that laws do not violate the Constitution, and then going after the Supreme Court, the country’s highest court. The tactic was to lower the retirement age for judges to 65 and then to stack the high court with party loyalists. Tens of thousands of Poles, including Lech Walesa, went into the streets on Tuesday, chanting “Solidarnosc” as they once did against the Communists; the European Union, which has already formally threatened Poland with sanctions, including a suspension of its voting rights over its assault on judiciary independence, opened a new “infringement procedure” that could lead to a suit against Poland in the European Union Court of Justice. Most grave, the president of the Supreme Court, Malgorzata Gersdorf, who is 65 and so was supposed to retire, refused to do so. With white roses in hand, Justice Gersdorf told a crowd outside the court that she was defying the government “to defend the rule of law and to testify to the truth about the line between the Constitution and the violation of the Constitution.” "
697,"The imminent prospect of a trade war, it seems, concentrates the mind. Until very recently, big business and the institutions that represent its interests didn’t seem to be taking President Trump’s protectionist rhetoric very seriously. After all, corporations have invested trillions based on the belief that world markets would remain open, that U.S. industry would retain access to both foreign customers and foreign suppliers. Trump wouldn’t put all those investments at risk, would he? Yes, he would — and the belated recognition that his tough talk on trade was serious has spurred a flurry of action. Major corporations and trade associations are sending letters to the administration warning that its policies will cost more jobs than they create. Meanwhile, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has begun an advertising campaign to convince voters of the benefits of free trade. Pathetic, isn’t it? Who in the Trump administration is going to pay attention to those letters? What, exactly, does the chamber think it will accomplish by running those ads? The thing is, big business is reaping what it sowed. No single cause brought us to this terrible moment in American history, but decades of cynical politics on the part of corporate America certainly played an important role. What do I mean by cynical politics? Partly I mean the tacit alliance between businesses and the wealthy, on one side, and racists on the other, that is the essence of the modern conservative movement. For a long time business seemed to have this game under control: win elections with racial dog whistles, then turn to an agenda of tax cuts and deregulation. But sooner or later something like Trump was going to happen: a candidate who meant the racism seriously, with the enthusiastic support of the Republican base, and couldn’t be controlled. "
698,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) In less than a decade, California has gone from being a standard-bearer for the ills of prison overcrowding to a national exemplar of reform, letting tens of thousands of people out of prison and reducing penalties for many crimes. Important measures were passed by voters in 2014 and 2016, but only now is research starting to show the effects on crime in California. The new data is fueling a continuing debate, with national implications, about whether California should continue on the path of reform, or take a step back and get tougher, once again, on crime. One recent study showed that an increase in crime in 2015 was not because of reforms. Another study determined that the reforms were not responsible for an increase in violent crime between 2014 and 2016 — that was from changes in reporting crime — but that they may have led to an increase in property crimes, specifically thefts from cars. Adding to the body of evidence this week was a report on crime in 2017 released by the attorney general, Xavier Becerra. That report showed violent crime had increased 1.5 percent, while property crimes were down 2.1 percent. The overall picture, according to supporters of criminal justice reform, is that crime is at historic lows in California. And they say that even if some categories have increased, such as thefts from automobiles, it hardly justifies a return to the days of mass incarceration. “My main takeaway is that criminal justice reform is continuing to advance public safety,” said Lenore Anderson, the founder and executive director of Californians for Safety and Justice, which has backed reforms. "
699,"WASHINGTON — Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, has asked federal prosecutors to help review the government documents of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, according to a letter obtained by The New York Times on Wednesday. Mr. Rosenstein’s request was an unusual insertion of politics into federal law enforcement. While the Justice Department has helped work on previous Supreme Court nominations, department lawyers in Washington typically carry out that task, not prosecutors who pursue criminal investigations nationwide. But in an email sent this week to the nation’s 93 United States attorneys, Mr. Rosenstein asked each office to provide up to three federal prosecutors “who can make this important project a priority for the next several weeks.” Names were to be submitted to Mr. Rosenstein’s office by the end of Wednesday. Mr. Trump nominated Judge Kavanaugh on Monday to replace Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who is retiring. In years of public service — including work for the independent counsel investigation of President Bill Clinton, on the 2000 Florida recount and as a White House aide to George W. Bush — Judge Kavanaugh generated a lengthy paper trail. That had Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, privately expressing concern that it might be used against him in his Senate confirmation hearings. Mr. Rosenstein’s email, which had the subject line “Personal Message to U.S. Attorneys From the Deputy A.G.,” included the sentence, “We need your help in connection with President Trump’s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the Supreme Court.” Former law enforcement officials described Mr. Rosenstein’s directive as a troubling precedent. “It’s flat-out wrong to have career federal prosecutors engaged in a political process like the vetting of a Supreme Court nominee,” said Christopher Hunter, a former F.B.I. agent and federal prosecutor who is running for Congress. “It takes them away from the mission they’re supposed to be fulfilling, which is effective criminal justice enforcement.” "
700,"BRUSSELS — President Trump wasted no time. NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, could barely finish the greetings at Wednesday’s breakfast when Mr. Trump launched into a clearly planned attack. It wasn’t directed at terrorism. It wasn’t against a military threat. Instead, it was aimed at Germany, one of the alliance’s most important members. “Germany, as far as I’m concerned, is captive to Russia because it’s getting so much of its energy from Russia,” Mr. Trump told the startled Mr. Stoltenberg at the opening of the NATO summit meeting. “We have to talk about the billions and billions of dollars that’s being paid to the country we’re supposed to be protecting you against.” “I think it’s something that NATO has to look at,” Mr. Trump said. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, politically weakened at home, reacted mildly but pointedly to Mr. Trump’s remarks, noting that she grew up in Soviet-occupied East Germany. “I myself experienced a part of Germany that was controlled by the Soviet Union, and I am very happy today that we are united in freedom as the Federal Republic of Germany,” Ms. Merkel said as she entered the NATO building. “We decide our own policies and make our own decisions, and that’s very good.” (Our reporters fact-checked President Trump’s claims about Germany’s energy imports from Russia.) The quiet rejoinder given by Ms. Merkel, leader of Europe’s most powerful country, seemed to encapsulate the complexities she faces in dealing with Mr. Trump. It also reflected her seeming reluctance to be the Western democratic voice that publicly stands up to him. "
701,"To the Editor: “Migrant Families Reunite Uneasily as Rules Change” (front page, July 11) uses the phrase “catch and release” to describe the pre-Trump immigration policy of releasing immigrants on their own recognizance. “Catch and release” is a sport fishing term for the practice of catching fish and releasing them, alive, back into the water. The Trump administration uses it as part of a strategy to dehumanize immigrants. The Times must not be complicit in this process of dehumanization, and must reject this biased term. TIM PIERCE, BERLIN, MASS. "
702,"Looking at the stock markets of the developed world, it is not immediately apparent that populists are busily hacking away at the postwar international economic order. The United States has, in the past four months, pursued a series of trade actions against its largest trading partners, including the announcement on Tuesday of $200 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods. The American stock market is up over that period. Since Britain voted in June 2016 to leave the European Union, its stock market has moved significantly higher. It did not even decline on Monday when two prominent ministers resigned from the British government, a protest of Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan to retain a close trading relationship with the European Union after the country leaves the bloc next year. The resignations were a reminder that, should Mrs. May fail to gain lasting support for her plan, the uncertainty surrounding Britain’s departure could escalate. But the headline stock market numbers do not tell the whole story. A closer look suggests that the threats to the global trading system are dampening investors’ enthusiasm, and the mood could darken quickly if the fights drag on and start to hurt companies’ profits. Britain’s two main stock market indexes, the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250, are both up over 20 percent since the June 2016 referendum in which voters chose to leave the European Union, a process known as Brexit. For comparison, Germany’s stock market is up by only slightly more since then. But stocks don’t tell the whole story. Since the Brexit vote, the British pound has plunged 13 percent against the euro, and 11 percent against the dollar. The pound may continue to decline if negotiations between Britain and the European Union go badly in the coming months. "
703,"To the Editor: In “The Cultural Vacuum in the White House” (Op-Ed, June 30), Dave Eggers talks about how Donald Trump’s presidency is the first in American history to be “almost completely devoid” of arts and culture. But even if Mr. Trump loved the arts, how could any artist with a soul, conscience and heart go to the White House and perform for him? A president who lets thousands of children be taken from their mothers, who mocks the disabled, who menacingly incites his mob to hate journalists, who bullies artists online, who boasts about abusing women, and who has shown himself to be a bigot and racist time and time again doesn’t deserve the honor of the company of artists, whose role in society is often as both moral and empathic agent. STUART ROJSTACZER
PALO ALTO, CALIF. The writer is a novelist and librettist. To the Editor: Dave Eggers is right for the wrong reasons. The problem with the Trump administration’s attitude toward the arts isn’t that the president hasn’t invited classical or jazz musicians to perform at the White House, but that he has threated to abolish the National Endowment for the Arts, a crucial source of financial support for artists. Although Mr. Eggers extols Ronald Reagan for the wide range of artists he played host to during his presidency, it’s worth remembering that David Stockman, Mr. Reagan’s first director of the Office of Management and Budget, wanted to wipe out both the arts endowment and the National Endowment for the Humanities. That ultimately didn’t happen during the Reagan administration, but it could under Donald Trump’s aegis. "
704,"In an effort to shed more light on how we work, The Times is running a series of short posts explaining some of our journalistic practices. Read more of this series here. Here, New York Times reporters and editors explain the “lede-all,” a story form that weaves together many narrative threads and leads the coverage of an event. Simon Romero needed internet service. He was on deadline, reporting from Haiti the day after the 2010 earthquake, and editors were waiting on his article. On a hunch, he hired a driver to take him to a hotel that was miraculously still standing. There, by candlelight, with a generator and a satellite internet connection, Mr. Romero filed a draft of his “lede-all,” a story that captured the devastating situation unfolding on the ground, and set the stage for the weeks of reporting that would follow. The lede-all is one of the most important and challenging story forms employed by reporters at The New York Times. As the name suggests, a lede-all leads the coverage of an event, weaving together many narrative threads, some of which are expanded upon in their own separate articles. It’s a form that is reserved for news of significant scale and consequence. In decades past, when print schedules determined when stories were published, a reporter might have had a day, or an afternoon at least, to craft a lede-all. Now, with news breaking on multiple platforms in real time, the lede-all has to provide an authoritative big-picture sense of the moment in a matter of hours. "
705,"LONDON — President Trump ripped into Germany, a NATO ally, even before this year’s summit meeting started in Brussels on Wednesday, using a longstanding disagreement on commercial and strategic relations with Russia. Departing from diplomatic protocol, Mr. Trump attacked Germany’s relations with Russia over breakfast with NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. “Germany, as far as I’m concerned, is captive to Russia because it’s getting so much of its energy from Russia,” he said. “So we’re supposed to protect Germany but they’re getting their energy from Russia.” In a polite but firm response, Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Germany “can make our own policies and make our own decisions.” Here are the facts and what experts say. Yes, but not as much as the president said. Germany is the world’s largest importer of natural gas, according to its Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources. The country with the largest natural gas resources is Russia. Nearly half the natural gas flowing through pipelines into Germany last year came from Russia. Like the rest of the European Union, Germany relies on Russian exports as its main supply of gas and crude oil. Natural gas is the fuel where Germany’s proportion of imports from Russia is highest: it’s about 40 percent for crude oil, and about 30 percent for coal. "
706,"Does President Trump hate Canada? Or are his tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum and his insults of  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nothing personal, just a logical extension of his “America first” political philosophy? Canadians may wonder, but they’re not waiting for an answer. As tensions escalate between the United States and Canada, some aren’t changing their behavior. But many are preparing to strike back with small acts of resistance. An entrepreneur in Toronto has a laundry list of American products she’ll no longer buy. An I.T. worker in a border town refuses to cross the border now. When we asked Canadians how they were reacting to the increasing tension, we heard from nearly 2,000 people across the country, the vast majority of whom said they were frustrated, upset or simply baffled. Here is a selection of the responses, condensed and edited for clarity. I normally travel with students; I will not even consider traveling to the U.S. Not only because we don’t want to spend our money there, but because many of my students are visible minorities and I don’t feel they would be welcome there. "
707,"Twitter will begin removing tens of millions of suspicious accounts from users’ followers on Thursday, signaling a major new effort to restore trust on the popular but embattled platform. The reform takes aim at a pervasive form of social media fraud. Many users have inflated their followers on Twitter or other services with automated or fake accounts, buying the appearance of social influence to bolster their political activism, business endeavors or entertainment careers. Twitter’s decision will have an immediate impact: Beginning on Thursday, many users, including those who have bought fake followers and any others who are followed by suspicious accounts, will see their follower numbers fall. While Twitter declined to provide an exact number of affected users, the company said it would strip tens of millions of questionable accounts from users’ followers. The move would reduce the total combined follower count on Twitter by about 6 percent — a substantial drop. An investigation by The New York Times in January demonstrated that just one small Florida company sold fake followers and other social media engagement to hundreds of thousands of users around the world, including politicians, models, actors and authors. The revelations prompted investigations in at least two states and calls in Congress for intervention by the Federal Trade Commission. In interviews this week, Twitter executives said that The Times’s reporting pushed them to look more closely at steps the company could take to clamp down on the market for fakes, which is fueled in part by the growing political and commercial value of a widely followed Twitter account. Officials at Twitter acknowledged that easy access to fake followers, and the company’s slowness in responding to the problem, had devalued the influence accumulated by legitimate users, sowing suspicion around those who quickly attained a broad following. “We don’t want to incentivize the purchase of followers and fake accounts to artificially inflate follower counts, because it’s not an accurate measure of someone’s influence on the platform or influence in the world,” said Del Harvey, Twitter’s vice president for trust and safety. “We think it’s a really important and meaningful metric, and we want people to have confidence that these are engaged users that are following other accounts.” "
708,"The comedian Sacha Baron Cohen has been called many things during his years of embarrassing celebrities on camera — and he can now add “evil,” “exploitative” and “truly sick” to the list. Sarah Palin, the former vice-presidential candidate, said on Tuesday in a lengthy Facebook post that she and one of her daughters were “duped” into apparently appearing on the British comedian’s new TV series. “Yup — we were duped. Ya’ got me, Sacha. Feel better now?” Ms. Palin wrote, saying she was a “victim” of the comedian for the Showtime series “Who Is America?,” which debuts on Sunday. Ms. Palin said she was invited to appear on a “legit Showtime historical documentary.” She was interviewed by what appeared to be a disabled veteran in a wheelchair, who she assumes was Mr. Cohen in disguise. He peppered her with questions, she added, that were “full of Hollywoodism’s disrespect and sarcasm.” Ms. Palin “finally had enough and literally, physically removed my mic and walked out,” she wrote. “The disrespect of our U.S. military and middle-class Americans via Cohen’s foreign commentaries under the guise of interview questions was perverse,” she added, before saying she was “purposefully” taken to the wrong airport after the interview and missed her flight home. Showtime declined to comment, and Mr. Cohen’s representatives did not immediately respond to a request. Ms. Palin did not threaten legal action in her Facebook post but called on Mr. Cohen, Showtime and its parent company, CBS, to donate any profits from the series to veterans’ charities. Joe Walsh, the former Republican congressman turned TV and radio personality, said in a series of Twitter posts late Tuesday and early Wednesday that he, too, had been deceived by Mr. Cohen’s show. He described being invited to a supposed pro-Israel event and interviewed on camera until “producers rushed me out of the studio as an apparent fight broke out.” “Strangest interview of my life,” Mr. Walsh added. Mr. Cohen has been sued in the past by people who have complained about his work after appearing in his films, such as 2006’s “Borat” and 2009’s “Brüno,” but several cases were dismissed. Dick Cheney, the former vice president, is among the other political figures interviewed for “Who Is America?” One clip from the series features Mr. Cheney signing what was described as a “waterboard kit.” President Trump also might be a target of the series. A teaser released on July 4 showed Mr. Trump calling Mr. Cohen “a third-rate character.” “I only wish he’d been punched in the face so many times right now he’d be in a hospital,” he added. Mr. Trump appeared in a segment of Mr. Cohen’s breakthrough “Da Ali G Show” in 2003. Mr. Cohen’s character pitched a clearly disgruntled Mr. Trump a business idea involving gloves to stop drips while eating ice cream. Mr. Trump has said he “immediately walked out” of the encounter, but Mr. Cohen said he was there for “about seven minutes.” "
709,"BEIJING — Until the door of the plane that took her to freedom in Germany closed, they hovered around. They escorted her on the 90-minute car ride from her apartment to the airport. They walked her through a special departure area. For the past year, China’s formidable security apparatus had guarded, watched and controlled the movements of Liu Xia, 57, widow of China’s most famous dissident, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died of cancer last July under police guard. Then, out of the blue, a security official telephoned her last week to say she could pick up a passport and leave the country, European diplomats said. The decision by the Chinese government to release Ms. Liu days before the anniversary of her husband’s death sprang from the passionate interest in her fate by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who requested Ms. Liu’s release during a meeting with her Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, an unusual move by a Western leader. That request coincided with China’s realization that Ms. Liu, a talisman of international human rights groups, had become a liability just as China’s image was taking a battering in the United States and Europe over what are considered predatory economic policies and increasingly authoritarian rule. Beijing calculated, diplomats said, that events planned in Germany on Friday to commemorate Mr. Liu’s death risked turning starkly negative if Ms. Liu were still under house arrest in Beijing, unable to talk to anyone but a few people, and forbidden to move freely beyond her apartment building.

Here’s what you need to know: • At the start of the military alliance’s annual summit meeting today in Brussels, President Trump called allies “delinquent” for failing to spend enough on their own defense, and he said Germany was a “captive” of Russia because of its energy dealings. Here are the latest updates from the start of Mr. Trump’s three-nation European trip, which will include a meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump’s criticism of NATO drew a rebuke from Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council. “Appreciate your allies,” Mr. Tusk said. “After all, you don’t have that many.” • NATO, forged after World War II to counter Soviet aggression, is more than an abstraction for Baltic States like Estonia and Latvia, which have large ethnic Russian populations. In the annexation of Crimea and its actions in Ukraine, Moscow has used protecting the rights of ethnic Russians as a pretext for intervention. "

712,"Good morning on this sweaty Wednesday. This is the story of a young progressive politician who was born in the Bronx, and who fought against a well-established political machine to become one of the youngest politicians in our city’s history. No, we’re not talking about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who defeated Representative Joseph Crowley in the Democratic primary for New York’s 14th Congressional District last month. We are referring to John Purroy Mitchel, who was elected mayor of New York City at the age of 34 in 1913. He was known as “the boy mayor of New York,” but died in a plane accident on July 6, 1918. His funeral was held in New York City exactly 100 years ago today. During Mr. Mitchel’s tenure as mayor, from 1914 to 1917, transit and factory workers were striking in the wake of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire, an outbreak of polio took the lives of almost 2,500 New Yorkers, and the United States was about to enter World War I. “It was a really tough time to be mayor,” said Kevin C. Fitzpatrick, a historian and the author of “World War I New York: A Guide to the City’s Enduring Ties to The Great War.” “You have to remember that at this time, two-thirds of New York City was foreign born,” he added. With anti-German sentiment in the city boiling, Mr. Mitchel banned the waving of foreign flags to ease tensions. “He deserves a lot of credit for how much he kept New York City together during World War I,” Mr. Fitzpatrick said. He was also an uncompromising reformer at a time when reform was not popular. “His four years did a lot to change the laws that we enjoy today — labor laws, safety laws — and he was big into helping immigrants and the working class and their safety,” Mr. Fitzpatrick said. "
713,"ADELANTO, Calif. — Moisés Valentín, a pastor at the Christian and Missionary Alliance, and I drove two hours outside of Los Angeles, to the middle of nowhere, high in the Mojave Desert. There, surrounded by sagebrush scrub and crowned in concertina wire, was the Adelanto Detention Facility, the nation’s largest prison for adult immigrants. Many of the people detained there are seeking asylum, running less toward the American dream than away from a Central American nightmare. Pastor Valentín wasn’t there to save their souls. He goes twice a month to try to save them from the United States government, which is treating them with unspeakable cruelty in violation of its own laws. Opponents of immigration have long had one rallying cry: rule of law! But most of the people seeking asylum at the Adelanto Detention Facility followed the law to a T. They presented themselves at ports of entry on our southern border and asked for asylum. The Trump administration seems to be using every tactic possible to prevent them from gaining that asylum, even if they clearly qualify. This spring Attorney General Jeff Sessions told immigration judges that they must rule on at least 700 cases a year. There’s no way they can realistically consider the evidence and still meet that quota; it’s much faster to just reject people’s claims. Then last month Mr. Sessions announced that domestic and gang violence — the most common reasons for fleeing Central America — would generally no longer qualify someone for asylum. The Trump administration is not just changing the rules; it’s making a mockery of them. It is illegal to bar people seeking asylum from our ports of entry, but we have effectively done just that. It is illegal to penalize asylum seekers, but we have criminally prosecuted them for “illegal” entry and violated their rights to due process by taking away their children. Last week, a federal court in Washington ruled that the Trump administration can’t indefinitely lock up asylum seekers who are awaiting a court hearing — but we are continuing to do the same thing to thousands of others. Instead of supporting people running from harm, we have built a machine designed to psychologically break them in the hopes that they will give up and go home. "
714,"Donald Trump prepared for this week’s NATO summit by doing what no president had done before — making a case that the alliance is a bad deal for the American people. Last week in Great Falls, Mont., he said that he had told Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, “I don’t know how much protection we get by protecting you.” Mr. Trump has been even tougher on the European Union, branding it “as bad as Nafta” and adding, “Sometimes our worst enemies are our so-called friends.” I have visited four European countries during the last two weeks, and it has been shocking to see how far from grace the United States has fallen in the eyes of its allies. European leaders point to Mr. Trump’s support for anti-democratic populists in Hungary, Poland and Italy. They view his recent Twitter attack on Ms. Merkel as a transparent attempt to push her from office. Many fear he may now remove American sanctions against Moscow over its occupation of Crimea after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia in Finland next week. Confidence in Mr. Trump has plummeted so much that the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, recently grouped “Donald Trump’s egotistic policy of America First” along with Russia and China as global concerns. None of this, of course, is likely to disturb Mr. Trump, who remains steadfast in his belief that whatever benefits the United States gained from the trans-Atlantic alliance in the past, the country no longer profits. But he’s wrong — there are compelling reasons that NATO in particular will be a distinct advantage for America’s security far into the future. First, NATO’s formidable conventional and nuclear forces are the most effective way to protect North America and Europe — the heart of the democratic world — from attack. Threats to our collective security have not vanished in the 21st century. Mr. Putin remains a determined adversary preying on Eastern Europe and American elections. NATO is a force multiplier: The United States has allies who will stand by us, while Russia has none. And while it’s true that most of America’s NATO allies need to increase their defense spending under the treaty, they’re not freeloaders: The United States has relied on NATO allies to strike back against Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and the Islamic State in the Middle East. European troops have replaced American soldiers in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and contribute the large majority in Kosovo. "
715,"I was recently honored for my birthday with an all-star reading of my play “The Destiny of Me.” It was obviously a very emotional experience for me. I’m supposed to be dead by now. Most of the guys who got infected with H.I.V. in the 1980s are long dead. The play is about a middle-aged man infected with H.I.V. undergoing an experimental treatment at the National Institutes of Health. In his hospital room he finds himself remembering his life since childhood. He realizes his entire life has been one long battle to be accepted as a homosexual: “Every social structure I’m supposed to be a part of — my family, my religion, my straight friends, my university, my city, my state, my country, my government, my newspaper, my TV, my many shrinks … tells me over and over and over that what I feel and see and think and do is sick.” We’ve come a certain distance from such a blanket suffocation. But by the time a modicum of acceptance by the outside world starts to arrive, we are visited with a plague. It is a plague of disease, and with our new president it continues to be a plague of hate. There is not one cabinet member who has supportive or welcoming words for us. Every week, it seems, Mr. Trump appoints another judge who is on record as hating us. They will serve for many years. A new Supreme Court will further echo this disdain. Meanwhile, Ronald Reagan’s astonishing negligence regarding the crisis back in the ’80s undoubtedly contributed to H.I.V. infections and deaths ballooning into a worldwide plague. I know I’m lucky to be alive. I have fought very hard to get here. I have had a liver transplant. I’ve lived long enough to see an anti-retroviral therapy became available. I have been able to legally marry the man I’ve loved for many years. "
716,"Good Wednesday. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. The White House said yesterday that it would impose tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods just days after slapping levies on $34 billion worth. China, professing “shock,” has promised to respond, without specifying how. Asian and European markets were rattled by the news this morning. U.S. markets were set to open lower, too. The new U.S. tariffs appear focused on Chinese manufacturing, covering electronics, textiles and auto parts, as well as minerals used in gadgets and batteries. Bloomberg points out that China’s response may have to stretch beyond tariffs, because the country imports only about $130 billion worth of goods from the U.S. Options include making it harder for American companies to operate in China, canceling orders for U.S. goods, or even putting tariffs on American energy. Rupert Murdoch’s media company increased its bid for control of the European satellite broadcaster this morning, surpassing Comcast’s. Fox’s latest offer values Sky at about $32.5 billion; Comcast’s in April valued it at $30.5 billion. Will Comcast counter the new bid? And how high might it go? The cable company loves Sky’s mix of content, its distribution channels and its rights to show the English Premier League, so a big fight is plausible. "
717,"CLEVELAND — The art world loves to flock to exotic locales for shows and fairs. Will it come to Cleveland? Fred Bidwell, a collector and philanthropist here, is betting it will, to the tune of $5 million — his money and that of other donors. “We’re at the front line of a lot of the changes, conflict and currents in the air today,” he said. “Cleveland is a blue city surrounded by an ocean of red. Artists have really been interested in creating new art within this context.” On July 14, “Front  International: Cleveland Triennial for Contemporary Art” opens with work by more than 110 artists at 28 venues across Cleveland and in nearby Akron and Oberlin. Mr. Bidwell, who conceived and orchestrated the event, graduated from Oberlin College and ran an advertising agency in Akron before opening a museum for his photography collection in a renovated transformer station here in 2013. The museum, Transformer Station, has been a catalyst for dynamic change in a once-seedy neighborhood on the West Side of Cleveland, and was one inspiration for the triennial. Mr. Bidwell was also motivated by his stint as interim director of the Cleveland Museum of Art in 2014. There he discovered firsthand the world-class collections of an institution that doesn’t bring in nearly as many visitors as its coastal counterparts. For Front, Mr. Bidwell has brought these two museums together with six other institutions — the Akron Art Museum, Allen Memorial Art Museum in Oberlin, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland Institute of Art, MOCA Cleveland and SPACES, also in Cleveland. Each has renovated in the last several years, a total investment of almost $500 million that helps counter the image of Cleveland from the 1970s and 1980s as a city in the depths of recession. "
718,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. First, let’s try a little thought experiment: Whenever President Trump starts talking about NATO, imagine what Vladimir Putin would want Trump to say. Then compare it to what Trump actually says. The two are often frighteningly similar. The pattern continued yesterday and today, with Trump disparaging NATO members on Twitter, on his way out of Washington and again when arriving at the NATO summit in Europe. Why is Trump doing this? I don’t know. But I do know the effect it’s having. Defying his own aides and senators from both parties, the president of the United States is jeopardizing the Western alliance that has done so much good over the past seven decades — and he is comforting Western Europe’s biggest modern enemy, Putin’s Russia. Related: “Trump Is Training His Base to Hate NATO and Like Putin,” by Jonathan Chait, in New York magazine. In the same publication, Heather Hurlburt writes, “The Trump administration has taken repeated concrete steps to damage European and international institutions and specific European governments.” More inequality? Yes, please. Federal tax policy in the 21st century has been like a tug of war. Thanks to President Trump, the rich are winning it once again. The top-earning 1 percent of households — those earning more than $607,000 a year — will pay a combined $111 billion less this year in federal taxes than they would have if the laws had remained unchanged since 2000. That’s an enormous windfall. It’s more, in total dollars, than the tax cut received over the same period by the entire bottom 60 percent of earners, according to an analysis being published today. "
719,"David Longstreth — the songwriter behind Dirty Projectors — is a man who’s rapturously in love for most of his eighth studio album, “Lamp Lit Prose.” Within the Dirty Projectors catalog, this is the joyful rebound from the bitter breakup songs of “Dirty Projectors,” the album he released in February 2017. But it also faces a bigger question: How should an artist respond to what America has become? In Mr. Longstreth’s 15 years of releasing Dirty Projectors albums, “Lamp Lit Prose” is his shiniest, airiest, even catchiest set of songs. The new record exchanges the jarring, glitchy electronic intrusions and arid trap percussion he used on “Dirty Projectors” for the springy guitar lines of older Dirty Projectors albums, bringing out their warmest tones. The album’s palette also features a horn section, summoning R&B punch and jazz richness, powered by human breath. Mr. Longstreth is still the classically trained musical oddball he was when he released “The Glad Fact” back in 2003. He still devises songs with melodies that hop around all over the place, meshed with precisely picked guitar counterpoint that also ricochets across the stereo channels. Yet amid the fractures and complexities, Mr. Longstreth also provides nuggets of approachable melody. And in new songs like “Blue Bird,” without second thoughts or any glimmer of irony or skepticism, Mr. Longstreth sings, “You and me, me and you/Something deep, something true.” [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] But “Lamp Lit Prose” is far from carefree. The “Dirty Projectors” album was completed before the beginning of the Trump administration, with its perpetual political strife and dystopian implications. Mr. Longstreth doesn’t let himself withdraw into complacent domesticity. “Lamp Lit Prose” faces the division between romantic bliss and political dread — between individual comfort and mass anxiety — by purposefully seesawing between them. For the (vanishing) listenership that still approaches an album as a whole, the sequence of “Lamp Lit Prose” alternates between bleak observations on the state of the world and happy love songs. “Crazy to feel like this/Up and down simultaneous,” Mr. Longstreth sings in “Zombie Conqueror,” with a chorus that contemplates “the midnight in front of us.” "

__________ A series of deals announced over the last week is designed to help German car manufacturers take a bigger slice of the world’s largest automobile market — and China develop its vision for the future of cars. Beijing has been vocal about its desires for electric and driverless cars. It is introducing aggressive rules to ensure that many of the new cars put on its roads have electric or hybrid engines. And autonomous vehicles are a key part of its Made in China 2025 plan to dominate important new technologies. To aid that effort, it has promised to open up its auto industry to foreign carmakers, a move that it has now doubled down on. The flurry of announcements from German companies shows that they are keen to take advantage of the situation. Among the new partnerships are these: ■ Volkswagen plans to develop electric vehicles under its SEAT brand, as part of an agreement with the Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group. It will also work with the FAW Group and the China Intelligent and Connected Vehicles Research Institute to develop autonomous cars. ■ BMW intends to increase the number of cars it produces annually at its two factories in China, which includes building electric Mini vehicles there in partnership with Great Wall Motor. It will also form a partnership with the Chinese technology company Baidu on autonomous cars. ■ Continental plans to work with Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride-sharing company, to develop internet-connected electric vehicles. ■ Daimler will receive a license to test its driverless vehicles on Beijing’s roads, the first such permit issued to a foreign carmaker. ■ Bosch will work with NIO, the Chinese electric vehicle start-up, to build sensors and control systems for electric cars. All this deal making makes sense for both sides. German automakers hope that by increasing production in China they can also increase sales in that country, the world’s largest car market. (For BMW and Daimler, the production could replace cars they currently make in the United States for export to China, which are caught up in the escalating tariff battle between the countries.) And China hopes this represents an opportunity to become an innovation hub for electric-and autonomous-car development, advancing its goal of becoming a technological powerhouse. Against this backdrop, Tesla announced Tuesday that it would build a factory in Shanghai — its first outside the United States, and the first in China to be wholly owned by a foreign automaker. Tesla says the plant will eventually be able to produce 500,000 vehicles a year. These developments are likely to displease President Trump. His administration’s trade war with China is focused in part on keeping technology out of Beijing’s hands. But right now, much of the high-tech auto industry appears to be moving away from Mr. Trump, and toward China. "
721,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. President Trump escalates his criticism of NATO, Twitter purges fake accounts and Croatia buries England’s World Cup dreams. Here’s the latest: • The NATO summit meeting in Brussels had a confrontational start as President Trump called European allies “delinquent” in their military spending and urged them to more than double their expenditures. He also wasted no time in lashing out at Germany, saying it was “captive” to Russia. (Our fact-check finds otherwise.) Chancellor Angela Merkel, above, who grew up under Soviet domination, issued a polite rejoinder: that now-unified Germans “decide our own policies and make our own decisions.” Mr. Trump did sign the 23-page NATO declaration, which is critical of Russia. After the meeting ends today, Mr. Trump will head to Britain and then, on Monday, meet President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Here’s the latest from Mr. Trump’s trip. _____ "
722,"Not so long ago, Europeans believed that despite Donald Trump’s harsh words, Washington would never endanger its Cold War alliances. “Do not read his tweets, follow his actions,” senior American officials told their European colleagues when the conversation turned to the future of the trans-Atlantic relations.   How wrong we were to believe them. It was the tweets that really mattered in the end. Within hours of the religiously anticipated NATO summit in Brussels today, President Trump was castigating Germany, historically one of America’s closest allies, claiming, ridiculously, that it is “captive” to Russia and calling NATO countries “delinquent.” Clearly, Mr. Trump is ignoring European Council President Donald Tusk’s appeal: “Dear America, appreciate your allies. After all, you don’t have that many.” For Mr. Trump, America’s alliances symbolize everything that is misguided about his country’s foreign policy. In a 1990 interview with Playboy magazine, he said that the United States is “defending wealthy nations for nothing — nations that would be wiped off the earth in about 15 minutes if it weren’t for us.” They “laugh at our stupidity.” His views don’t seem to have changed since then. Europeans are now finally being forced to realize that Mr. Trump’s world is one shorn of allies. Europe’s reaction to this new reality brings to mind Stevie, the heroine from Edward Albee’s play “The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?” when she learns that her husband has fallen in love with a goat. The shock is so great that she simply refuses to understand. That’s basically what Europe is doing right now. In the lead-up to the NATO summit, presidents and prime ministers reiterated familiar lines about trans-Atlantic relations as though nothing had changed with Mr. Trump’s election. Here’s why the European leaders are so surprised: It’s not difficult to imagine a mainstream political leader campaigning with promises to build a wall on the border, move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and punish the Chinese government for its economic policies. Mainstream politicians might easily pledge all of these, but upon assuming power they would never act on them. "
723,"LONDON — For decades British leaders have relied on meetings with American presidents to show off their influence over a global superpower and illustrate the durability of the “special relationship” they prize so much. But for Prime Minister Theresa May, who has endured months of political turbulence, including the recent resignation of Boris Johnson, her foreign secretary, President Trump’s impending trip to Britain looks like it could be an ordeal more than anything else. Even before his arrival, Mr. Trump stirred the pot, suggesting that he would like to catch up with his “friend” Mr. Johnson while in Britain, a country that the president described as “in somewhat turmoil.” [Read what Mr. Trump said about the prospect of demonstrations in Britain, and what protesters have planned.] When asked whether Mrs. May should stay in her job, Mr. Trump adopted the pose of a disinterested observer, pronouncing this a question for “the people.” He then suggested that speaking with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, which he is scheduled to do next week, might be easier than conversing with Mrs. May, who will host a dinner and a lunch with the president during his stay. Yet the prime minister has little choice but to swallow her pride and get on with it, as she herself likes to say, because she wants Mr. Trump’s help for a trade deal with the United States after Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, known as Brexit. And, anyway, compared with wrestling with her government, which this week suffered three ministerial resignations, spending a couple of awkward days with Mr. Trump might actually be a relief. "
724,"WASHINGTON — Hoping to delay his trial in Virginia on charges of bank fraud and money laundering, Paul Manafort instead managed this week to get himself transferred from a jail where prosecutors said he described his treatment as “V.I.P.” to one where his lawyers claim he is worried about his safety. Mr. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, has been incarcerated since June 15 in a regional jail in rural Virginia about two hours south of Washington. Prosecutors said Wednesday in a court filing that Mr. Manafort had “unique privileges” there, including a larger-than-average cell, “his own bathroom and shower facility, his own personal telephone and his own work space to prepare for trial.” He also was not required to wear a prison uniform and was allowed to use his laptop in his cell, they said. But Mr. Manafort’s lawyers, in a motion that sought to delay his July 25 trial, argued in part that they had to travel 100 miles to meet with their client. Phone calls with him were limited to 10 minutes, and electronic communications were restricted, they said. Judge T. S. Ellis III of the United States District Court in Alexandria, Va., who has been assigned the case, fashioned a remedy. On Tuesday, he ordered that Mr. Manafort be transferred to a jail in Alexandria, about 20 minutes from Washington, “to ensure that defendant has access to his counsel and can adequately prepare his defense.” Mr. Manafort’s lawyers then objected, arguing that “after further reflection, issues of distance and inconvenience must yield to concerns about his safety and, more importantly, the challenges he will face in adjusting to a new place of confinement” only two weeks before trial. But Judge Ellis had apparently made up his mind. “Having just complained” about the jail in Warsaw, Va., he wrote, Mr. Manafort’s lawyers had not identified any specific threat to his safety at the Alexandria jail. Jailers there are “very familiar with housing high-profile defendants, including foreign and domestic terrorists, spies and traitors,” he wrote. "
725,"WASHINGTON — The Senate narrowly confirmed a former Justice Department official on Wednesday to lead the department’s Criminal Division and oversee the government’s career prosecutors, including those investigating President Trump. Democrats fought the nomination of the former staff member, Brian A. Benczkowski, raising questions about his qualifications. Mr. Benczkowski has never tried a case in court and was also scrutinized over private-sector work for one of Russia’s largest banks. The 51-to-48 vote was along party lines, with only Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, joining Republicans to confirm Mr. Benczkowski. His confirmation broke a logjam of pending nominations for top jobs at the Justice Department, where officials and employees complained privately and publicly that the Senate took an unusually long time to greenlight Mr. Benczkowski, who was nominated 13 months ago. “Brian is an outstanding lawyer with a diverse public service and criminal law background spanning over 20 years,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. “At a time like this — with surging violent crime and an unprecedented drug epidemic — this position is especially important.” Mr. Benczkowski, 48, has worked since 2010 as a lawyer focused on white-collar criminal defense cases at the firm Kirkland & Ellis. In that job, he helped Russia’s Alfa Bank investigate whether its computer servers had contacted the Trump Organization, a question that touched directly on suspicions about the bank that emerged in the early months of the Trump-Russia affair. "
726,"WASHINGTON — House Republican leaders and a platoon of former wrestlers have come out in support of Representative Jim Jordan as he deflects allegations that he turned a blind eye to sexual abuse as a wrestling coach at Ohio State, an extraordinary show of solidarity that indicates just how much power the conservative stalwart still wields. Those backers, in rebutting the allegations of eight former wrestlers, have hewed to a strategy that simultaneously defends Mr. Jordan’s integrity, undermines his accusers, discredits mainstream news reports and invokes a “deep state” conspiracy. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin emerged on Wednesday as the latest prominent House Republican to defend Mr. Jordan. The majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, and the majority whip, Steve Scalise of Louisiana — both strong candidates to replace the departing Mr. Ryan — also backed him this week. Their statements of support have centered on the same message: The Mr. Jordan they know always stands up for what is right. “Jim Jordan is a friend of mine,” Mr. Ryan said at a news conference on Capitol Hill. “We haven’t always agreed with each other over the years. But I always have known Jim Jordan to be a man of honesty, and a man of integrity.” Mr. Jordan, a founder of the House Freedom Caucus who is in his sixth term, had also been floated as a possible successor to Mr. Ryan. "
727,"WASHINGTON — “Errrrrgggggahhhh,” said Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, when asked his opinion of President Trump’s harsh words for the United States’ NATO allies on Wednesday. “I haven’t had time to sift through all that.” “All that” would be Mr. Trump’s widely reported fusillade against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization over breakfast in Brussels with Jens Stoltenberg, the alliance’s secretary general. “Frankly, many countries owe us a tremendous amount of money for many years back, where they’re delinquent, as far as I’m concerned, because the United States has had to pay for them,” Mr. Trump said, mischaracterizing how the commitments for NATO military spending work. Then, as members of the delegation stared into their orange juice, Mr. Trump told them that Germany was a “captive” of Russia because it receives 9 percent of its natural gas from the country — though Mr. Trump erroneously said it was 70 percent. Back in Washington, Mr. Roberts, making an escape into a Senate elevator, said he was focused on agriculture. But was it helpful, what the president said about the alliance? “It is what it is,” Mr. Roberts said as the elevator doors closed. "
728,"“We are no captives — neither of Russia nor of the United States.” HEIKO MAAS, Germany’s foreign minister, responding on Twitter to accusations by President Trump that Germany was “captive to Russia” because of energy dependency. "
729,"WASHINGTON — Democrats who once saw health care and abortion as their best lines of attack against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, are recalibrating their approach to go after him for his view that a sitting president should not have to answer questions in a criminal case, much less face indictment. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in an interview on Wednesday that Judge Kavanaugh’s belief in broad presidential authority was “just off the deep end.” For Democrats facing an uphill struggle to block Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation, his protective views of the presidency could prove to be a bright red ribbon. Rather than just playing it safe with a broad swath of voters worried about access to health care and abortion, Democrats now see an opportunity to excite their base by fanning fears that the highest court in the land could turn into a bulwark to protect the man appointing its members. As the judge made the rounds of the Capitol — he paid courtesy calls on Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina — Mr. Schumer and his Democratic colleagues were gaming out a line of questioning that, they hope, will create a perception that a Justice Kavanaugh would compromise the independence of the court. Mr. Schumer said the questions could appeal even to more moderate voters. “This issue, I think, will affect a lot of people who are sort of O.K. with Trump but think there needs to be a check and balance,” Mr. Schumer said. “There are a lot of people in America who still say, ‘I voted for him, I guess he’s O.K.’ But when you ask them, ‘Does he need a check and balance?,’ they say, ‘Definitely.’” In two law journal articles — one published in 1998 and another in 2009 — Judge Kavanaugh raised questions about whether a sitting president could be indicted, and suggested that presidents should be shielded from civil suits and criminal investigations. Both explore issues that are deeply relevant to Mr. Trump and the ongoing investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. "
730,"Last month, Mayor Bill de Blasio joined a group of other mayors on a trip to Tornillo, Tex., where they tried unsuccessfully to get into a detention center for immigrant children who had been separated from their parents under President Donald Trump’s crackdown on people crossing the border illegally. In doing so, Mr. de Blasio hoped to garner attention for the children’s plight, and to what he said on Wednesday was a “broken and horrendous policy.” The mayor has ultimately succeeded in getting attention for his trip — but not for the intended reasons. The Customs and Border Protection recently sent a letter to the New York police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, accusing Mr. de Blasio, his police security detail and other people traveling with him of having crossed the border illegally and ignoring the instructions of a border patrol agent. Mr. de Blasio scoffed at the accusation, first reported by The Associated Press, and called it “absolutely ridiculous.” But he refused to answer questions about the incident, both in the morning while arriving at City Hall and later during an event in Brooklyn, and he did little to clarify what had actually happened. After the mayors were turned away from the detention center last month, Mr. de Blasio decided to drive into Mexico to get a view of the detention center from the other side of the border. "
731,"Broadcom has agreed to buy the software maker CA Technologies for nearly $19 billion, according to the two companies. The acquisition by Broadcom, which has become a formidable competitor in the semiconductor market in the past decade, would be the first major move by the company since its $117 billion bid for Qualcomm was blocked by the Trump administration in March. The Trump administration thwarted the Qualcomm deal citing national security concerns. White House officials said that allowing Qualcomm, an American leader in smartphone chips and wireless technology, to be taken over by a foreign company might strengthen China’s hand in a strategic industry. Broadcom, then headquartered in Singapore, had stated its intention to move its headquarters to the United States, but that was not enough to allay the administration’s concerns. The company, whose technology is used in everything from smartphones to data centers, has since moved its headquarters to San Jose, Calif. Broadcom is offering CA Technologies’ shareholders $44.50 a share, about 20 percent higher than their closing price on Wednesday. Broadcom shares declined by about 6 percent in after-hours trading, while shares for CA Technologies rose more than 16 percent. CA Technologies, formerly known as Computer Associates, was founded in 1976 as a maker of business programs for mainframe computers. Today, it has a broad range of software products from mainframe programs to cloud-based software for computer security. "
732,"The National Endowment for the Arts has announced its 2019 Jazz Masters, and it’s a diverse group. The honorees are the composer and bandleader Maria Schneider, the South African pianist Abdullah Ibrahim, the pianist and vocalist Bob Dorough and the critic Stanley Crouch. Last year, the Jazz Masters program appeared imperiled, as the Trump administration proposed eliminating the N.E.A. entirely. But the equilibrium has been restored, at least for now: The winners will each receive a $25,000 prize, as usual, and they will be celebrated according to custom in a ceremony at the Kennedy Center on April 15. Ms. Schneider, 57, is the youngest woman ever to be selected for the award, and the rare recipient who’s still in the prime of her career. Known for her ambitious compositions and dazzling orchestral work, Ms. Schneider, a Minnesota native, is a five-time Grammy Award winner and a perennial presence atop the DownBeat critics poll. Mr. Ibrahim is the first African-born musician to be chosen for the award; he moved to the United States in the 1960s, eventually becoming an American citizen. Since then, he has drawn from the musical mélange of his hometown, Cape Town; the influence of earlier pianists like Thelonious Monk and Duke Ellington; and the avant-garde innovations that greeted him when he first arrived in New York City. Mr. Dorough, whose career in jazz spanned more than 60 years, will become the rare posthumous recipient of the award. He was best known for the music to “Schoolhouse Rock,” but his compositions also appeared on recordings by the likes of Miles Davis and Blossom Dearie. Mr. Dorough was notified earlier this year that he had been selected to receive the award, but he died soon after. (Jazz Masters must be living at the time of their nomination.) Mr. Crouch, 72, is this year’s recipient of the A. B. Spellman N.E.A. Jazz Masters Fellowship for Jazz Advocacy. He began his career as an avant-garde drummer and poet before embracing a neoclassical ideology and establishing himself as one of the most provocative and influential writers on jazz. A friend and mentor of Wynton Marsalis, he played a central role in the founding of Jazz at Lincoln Center in the late 1980s. Mr. Crouch’s books include the essay collection “Considering Genius,” the novel “Don’t the Moon Look Lonesome?” and “Kansas City Lightning: The Rise and Times of Charlie Parker.” "
733,"BRUSSELS — President Trump escalated his campaign of criticism against European allies on Wednesday, accusing Germany of being “captive to Russia” and demanding that all NATO members double their military spending targets. On the first of two days of meetings with NATO leaders, Mr. Trump stopped short of any substantive breaks with the alliance, reaching agreement on a plan to improve military readiness and signing on to a joint statement that emphasized burden-sharing and harshly criticized Russia. But coming just days before he is to meet President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Trump’s critical stance toward the allies focused additional attention on longstanding concerns by the United States about the willingness of Europe to shoulder its share of the financial burden for NATO. Mr. Trump again demanded that the allies all meet their commitment to raise their military budgets to 2 percent of their economic output by 2024, but then further stepped up the pressure by saying they should make it 4 percent, and he continued to press the point on Thursday. More broadly, his performance, leavened at times by a more reassuring tone, left his fellow leaders struggling anew to judge whether he was posturing in an effort to win a better deal for the United States, moving to weaken institutions at the heart of the post-World War II order or both. "
734,"When members of the now-defunct Independent Democratic Conference reunited with mainstream Democrats in the New York State Senate in early April, they probably hoped that their fledgling primary challengers would fade. In the three months since, that has not happened. Instead, there are increasing signs that those challengers are making inroads with members of the state’s political establishment and with local leaders in the districts they hope to represent. And in many cases, endorsements are being driven by the I.D.C.’s past association with Republicans, with whom it collaborated to help that party maintain control of the State Senate for more than seven years. The latest example will come on Thursday, when four Assembly members from central Brooklyn will endorse Zellnor Myrie, a 31-year-old Democrat who is challenging Senator Jesse Hamilton, who defected to the I.D.C. in late 2016, saying he wanted to “get results.” That decision — either pragmatic or opportunistic, depending on your worldview — now seems like it could come back to haunt former I.D.C. members like Mr. Hamilton and his peers. “We need progressive public servants in our State Legislature,” said Assemblyman Walter T. Mosley, one of the four lawmakers endorsing Mr. Myrie, in a statement that characterized the I.D.C. as a “broken model of political expediency and self-interest.” “Zellnor Myrie is that leader.” In Queens, meanwhile, another Assembly member, Aravella Simotas, intends to endorse another young challenger on Thursday: Jessica Ramos, 33, who is running to unseat Senator Jose Peralta, who also left the mainstream Democrats to join the I.D.C. last year. “Jose Peralta betrayed Queens,” Ms. Simotas said on Wednesday, “while Jessica Ramos will fight for women, students and affordable housing.” "

736,"Eighteen months into Jared Kushner’s White House tenure, his family’s real estate firm is deepening its financial relationships with institutions and individuals that have a lot riding on decisions made by the federal government. In the latest example, an arm of Brookfield Asset Management is close to completing an investment of up to $700 million in the Kushner family’s tower at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. The deal will be a boon to the Kushners, who are struggling to recoup their investments in their flagship building. At the same time, another Brookfield unit is awaiting the Trump administration’s approval of its acquisition of the nuclear-power company Westinghouse Electric. The deal is being reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, made up of senior federal officials who consider the potential national security risks of transactions involving foreign companies. Brookfield’s headquarters are in Canada. Mr. Kushner, who is President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has broad portfolios of both White House responsibilities and personal business interests — a combination that experts say has the potential to create real and perceived conflicts between his public and private roles. “Jared knows who is invested with the family business. He can’t unlearn that,” said Don Fox, acting director of the Office of Government Ethics under President Barack Obama and an official in both Republican and Democratic administrations. “There is absolutely potential for him to be influenced if he has to make a decision or provide advice to cabinet officials that could affect his investors. And that can’t be lost on the people that are investing with him.” The family’s business, Kushner Companies, declined to comment. Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Mr. Kushner’s lawyer, said Mr. Kushner had followed the advice of ethics lawyers concerning the sale of certain assets and “is not in any position to comment on business decisions made by others at his former companies since he left.” Representatives of the White House did not respond to requests for comment.

737,"This is the Climate Fwd: newsletter, which you can get weekly by email if you sign up here. After 12 members of a youth soccer team and their coach were trapped in the Tham Luang Cave in northern Thailand nearly three weeks ago, their plight, and then their rescue, captured the world’s attention. By now, it’s well known that their predicament was caused by rising floodwaters in the cave. What is less known is that the pattern of precipitation that ensnared them is in keeping with broader changes to the region’s seasonal monsoon that researchers have attributed to climate change. “Over the South Asian landmass, we’ve seen that extreme rainfall events have become more frequent,” said Amit Tandon, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth who studies ocean systems. No one is suggesting that climate change itself was responsible for trapping the boys in the cave. Brief downpours have always been common during Thailand’s wet season, which runs from late May to early October. Periods of a week or two of relatively heavy rainfall are punctuated by drier periods. The alternating dry and wet periods are called the intraseasonal oscillation, said Arnold L. Gordon, a professor of earth and environmental sciences at Columbia University. That variation has always happened, unrelated to climate change. But what has changed in recent years is that those wet periods have been wetter. “It’s likely climate change, in the sense that there’s more moisture in the air,” Dr. Gordon said. Warmer air can hold more moisture, and “when the air has more moisture in it, you would get wetter wet bands and drier dry bands,” he said. "
738,"Pottery, improbably, is the latest escapist pastime to sweep the nation. Because making ceramics requires persistence and all-consuming concentration, it is said to be a perfect salve for a particular set of modern anxieties — too much work, too much news, too much internet. When your hands are slathered in clay, you cannot fiddle around with your phone. To me, a serial hobbyist who has been looking for a saner balance with tech, all this sounded wonderful. In January, I began taking a weekly pottery class at a local arts school. I’m still a novice ceramist at best, but every week, bowl by bowl, I get a little better. There’s something else that has been magical about the experience. Although I took up pottery to go offline, it has driven something surprising for me online: It helped restore my faith in the possibilities and the basic humanity of the internet. Pottery has helped me find a saner, friendlier corner of the internet than the social-networking feeds we are addicted to, one that isn’t completely obsessed with Donald J. Trump, where you get ahead not through pointed, viral quips but through collaboration, persistence and shared ingenuity. I speak of the hobbyist internet. These days, any pastime worth pursuing — pottery, cooking, gardening, quilting, woodworking and beyond — attracts a constellation of blogs, message boards, Facebook groups, Amazon reviewers, Instagram and Etsy influencers, and many hundreds of YouTube stars. Collectively, they form the online social structure around any hobby, a group of folks who are only too happy to help you learn whatever you are trying to master. It is here, in the hobbyist internet’s daily collective struggle to make the best hamburger or grow the perfect tomato, that you can glimpse a healthier relationship with your digital devices. And not a moment too soon. The internet has gotten a bad rap lately, and we are justifiably worried that our digital devices are driving isolation and fear, polarization and addiction, loneliness and outrage. The worries seem to call for a simple fix — we should all just use the internet less often. "
739,"The reunions in New York began Tuesday night and continued at a trickle Wednesday morning — a handful of families whose children were among the youngest of those separated at the border. All the adults were fitted for ankle bracelets, their tether to the federal government. They left for the next stages of their journey, released and headed to relatives’ homes all over the country, with little more than the dirty clothes in which they crossed the border. But they had the most important thing. Denis Rivas was back with Joshua, 4, after not even speaking to him since they were separated a month ago. Maria Guinac was with her three children, too — the youngest, Gustavo, turned 3 while she was being held in Texas. Javier Garrido was with his 4-year-old, William, who had been taken from him in the middle of the night in Laredo, Tex. A court order had mandated the government to reunify parents with children younger than 5 who had been separated from their families by Tuesday. But in many cases the deadline was missed. It was still unclear on Wednesday how many of the 63 children under 5 in federal custody across the country, who appeared to be eligible under a court order from a California judge for immediate reunification, had actually been returned to their parents. But according to a Trump administration official, authorities anticipated that as of early Thursday morning, they will have reunified all children under age 5 who are eligible under the court order for reunification with parents in the United States. "
740,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s trade war is expected to temporarily bolster United States economic growth, in part because Beijing tried to beat the clock on Mr. Trump’s tariffs by stocking up on American soybeans, crude oil and other exports. Economists are predicting that the gross domestic product for the second quarter could reach 5 percent when the preliminary numbers are released on July 27. The United States trade gap with China has narrowed, as more American products were shipped to Beijing ahead of the tariffs, which went into effect on July 6. But both effects are expected to be fleeting, and the short-term economic improvement could turn into a long-term loss if both countries follow through with their threats to continue escalating tariffs against each other. “They will dance, they will sing, they will say, look at the plunge in the trade deficit in the second quarter,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics. “That is of course complete drivel.” The United States is engaged in multiple trade wars at once as it imposes tariffs on metals from the European Union, Mexico, Canada and other nations. But it is waging an even bigger fight with China, a dispute that threatens to engulf broad swaths of the world’s two largest economies. The Trump administration has accused the Chinese of a variety of trade abuses, including intellectual property theft and denying American companies equal access to China’s market. Mr. Trump has already imposed tariffs of 25 percent on $34 billion worth of Chinese products and has threatened to hit as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods with levies. On Tuesday, the administration released a list of an additional $200 billion in products that could face tariffs as soon as September. China had already responded with tariffs of its own, on soybeans, pork, automobiles and other products and signaled that its next wave of tariffs could include American oil exports. "
741,"Several readers have written to The Times to express their concern with our use of the phrase “catch and release” in our recent coverage of the Trump administration’s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration. “ ‘Catch and release’ is a sport fishing term for the practice of catching fish and releasing them, alive, back into the water,” Tim Pierce from Berlin, Mass., wrote in a letter to the editor on Wednesday. “The Trump administration uses it as part of a strategy to dehumanize immigrants. The Times must not be complicit in this process of dehumanization, and must reject this biased term.” We asked our deputy national editor Kim Murphy to respond. The phrase “catch and release” has been used off-and-on to describe immigration policy since at least the administration of George W. Bush. President Trump has made it a favorite term for what he considers the government’s lack of vigilance in detaining migrants who cross the border illegally. For too long, he argues, the government has allowed migrants in such cases to be released from detention and simply show up for their immigration hearings in order to remain, possibly for years, in the United States. Such a policy, he believes, encourages more migrant families to embark on dangerous journeys, persuaded by precedent that freedom waits at the other end. Mr. Trump is a master of catchphrases; he uses them so often that news organizations can be tempted to adopt them, often tongue-in-cheek, as shorthand for government policy. “Drain the swamp” (trim government bureaucracy). “Big, beautiful wall” (fortify the border). “Worst trade deal ever” (Nafta). “Greatest theft in the history of the world” (China). “Rocket man” (North Korea). “Fake news” (fill in the blank). “Catch and release” has had a way of seeping into news coverage because it so succinctly describes a complex set of responses to illegal immigration and asylum law. I personally would never have thought of it as a way of equating human beings to fish. Yet of course by adopting a fishing metaphor, it does precisely that. Here on the National desk, we’ve asked all our immigration writers to think carefully before using this phrase, making sure they include it only in reference to the administration’s use of the phrase; we don’t want to make it ours. Please share your thoughts in the comments. "

At the military alliance’s annual summit meeting in Brussels, Mr. Trump called its members “delinquent” for not spending more on their own defense. He also portrayed Germany as a “captive” of Russia for importing so much of that country’s natural gas. We fact-checked his assertions. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who grew up in Soviet-controlled East Germany, offered a polite but firm rejoinder to that second point. Now “united in freedom,” she said, Germans “can make our own policies and make our own decisions.” Here’s what happened on Day 1 of the NATO meeting, which wraps up later today. Mr. Trump goes on to Britain, where his agenda includes meeting Queen Elizabeth on Friday. On Monday, he’ll be in Helsinki to meet with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. _____ "
743,"Although mightily challenged by a fragmenting retail landscape, and lamentable calendar placement as the caboose on the global men’s wear train, New York Fashion Week: Men’s was like “The Little Engine that Could,” refusing to give in to naysayers perennially pronouncing doom. “Sure, there’s no Ralph, no Calvin, no Tom,” Steven Kolb, the chief executive of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, said before a polished show by Carlos Campos, referring to Mr. Lauren, Mr. Klein and Mr. Ford. With only the modest but sturdy all-American designer Todd Snyder to serve as its tent pole, the men’s week may have lacked some of the showbiz pizazz associated with big-name designers, as Mr. Kolb conceded. “But it has found its right size,” he said. And if no single breakaway star emerged from the roughly 40 shows and presentations rolled out over three days, there was plenty to applaud. There was the gritty determination of independents like Willy Chavarria, Krammer & Stoudt and David Hart. There were the unabashed helpings of male pulchritude served up by the sportswear designers Parke & Ronen. There was the evolutionary leap forward from Etsy-style patchwork to globalized sophistication at Bode. And there was the emergence of cannabis culture — “smokewear,” the Sundae School designer called it — as a brave new fashion frontier. "
744,"FAIRFAX, Va. — The Free Market Environmental Law Clinic has long sought to inject doubt into the public conversation about global warming. Now, the future of the group itself is in doubt. Its founders are battling in court over control of the group, as well as some $900,000 in its bank account. One of them, David Schnare, has been accused by his former allies of botching the group’s tax-exempt status and of attempting to extort a quarter-million dollars from its coffers. It all comes at a time when Free Market — which made a name for itself using the legal system to obtain climate scientists’ emails — should be ascendant. The Trump administration shares its views on environmental regulation and its dismissal of climate science. And Mr. Schnare, 70, was part of the Trump “beachhead team” at the Environmental Protection Agency during the transition between presidential administrations, though he did not last long there. Mr. Schnare, in an interview, initially expressed reluctance to discuss the situation at Free Market. “Attorneys are not supposed to talk about and try cases in the press,” he said. Then he added, “I completely deny all these nasty accusations.” The legal battle sprawls across three civil lawsuits filed against Mr. Schnare by Matthew Hardin, 28, the chairman of Free Market’s board. Neither side recognized the other’s claim of control, so the fight began with Free Market essentially suing itself. "
745,"KUANTAN, Malaysia — Amanda Lacaze grabbed her iPhone and rattled off the names of the special minerals needed to make it. The screen was polished with lanthanum and cerium. The inside has a magnet made with neodymium and praseodymium. Those minerals almost certainly came from China. Ms. Lacaze’s job is to give the world an alternative source, in case a global trade war spirals out of control and China cuts off supply. Right now, she can’t. Her company, Lynas Corporation, can provide only a fraction of the minerals — known as rare earths — that China produces. And even that source isn’t a sure thing: The work is so volatile, complex and expensive that Lynas once came close to collapsing. “There were times where we were sitting there and I’m saying, ‘Can we really afford to put coffee into the staff rooms?’” Ms. Lacaze said. The Trump administration amped up its trade fight with China on Tuesday when it threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese goods, ranging from frozen catfish fillets to copper wires to piston engines. China has threatened to match them dollar for dollar. But it has other ways to retaliate beyond tariffs. It could refuse to buy American products, like planes from Boeing. It could intensify regulation of American companies doing business on the mainland. It could threaten to offload a piece of its huge portfolio of Treasuries, which could rattle the bond market. "
746,"Hardcore conservatives adore infrastructure, and they’re phenomenally good at building it. This isn’t to say they’re necessarily committed to constructing roads and bridges and dams; it’s the infrastructure of their own movement — the one that has helped Republican politicians seize power in state legislatures over the past decade — that inspires their real dedication. Their efforts have been chronicled in books like Jane Mayer’s “Dark Money” and Nancy MacLean’s “Democracy in Chains.” A conservative donor class, seeking to protect its agenda from the uncertainties of a democratic system, has erected a scaffolding of legislative groups and gerrymandered districts with the care and diligence of a structural engineer. For progressives, Wisconsin has been a demoralizing case in point. In “The Fall of Wisconsin: The Conservative Conquest of a Progressive Bastion and the Future of American Politics,” the Brooklyn-based journalist and Wisconsin native Dan Kaufman shows how the state became a conservative test case. As the head of the right-wing, Milwaukee-based Bradley Foundation told him, “Wisconsin is a laboratory for the rest of the country.” The state, which Barack Obama carried over John McCain by 14 points in 2008, was supposed to be part of Hillary Clinton’s “blue wall” in the 2016 election. It instead went to Donald J. Trump, pushing him past the number of Electoral College votes he needed to win the presidency. As Kaufman makes clear, though, the notion that Wisconsin in 2016 was some sort of Democratic stronghold showed just how complacent Clinton and the liberal establishment had become. Trump, sensing an opportunity, made an aggressive play for the state. Clinton, in stark contrast, sent surrogates instead of showing up herself. Kaufman describes her as not just out of touch but quite literally not there. True, Wisconsin was long known for its progressive traditions; in the early 20th century, its state legislature established the nation’s first workers’ compensation program and a progressive state income tax, among other measures. The Scandinavian farmers who settled there in the 1800s had brought with them a communitarian mind-set born of necessity. The Swedish word folkhemmet, or “the people’s home,” became an affectionate nickname for the welfare state. "
747,"At first glance, President Trump’s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court would seem a perfect reminder of why so many religious white Americans vote Republican: to promote conservative moral values. Religious values. Their values. The values that — the story goes — devout white Protestants and Catholics want to see in Washington. As it turns out, that narrative has it partly backward. It’s not just that our religious beliefs affect our politics — it’s that our politics affect our religious choices. We don’t just take cues about politics from our pastors and priests; we take cues about religion from our politicians. To see this, consider that as recently as the 1970s, white Republicans were no more religious than white Democrats. Today they are nearly 20 percent more likely to go to church regularly and likewise about 20 percent more likely to believe in God. The familiar explanation is that this religiosity gap arose because religious Americans shifted into the Republican Party while less religious and secular Americans became Democrats. Supposedly, this sorting began in response to the changing political landscape of the 1970s and 1980s, when social issues were intensely debated, religious elites like Jerry Falwell rose to prominence, and Republican politicians increasingly focused on morality and faith. But this explanation misses a key fact: Most Americans choose a political party before choosing whether to join a religious community or how often to attend religious services. Faith often becomes a peripheral concern in adolescence and young adulthood — precisely the years when we tend to form stable partisan attachments. Religion typically becomes relevant again later, after we have children and start to think about their religious upbringings. By that time, our political views are set, ready to guide our religious values and decisions. "
748,"President Trump spent Monday in Helsinki, Finland, for a closely watched summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the final leg of a weeklong trip that also took him to Brussels for a NATO gathering, and to Britain for talks with Prime Minister Theresa May and tea with Queen Elizabeth II. Doug Mills, a New York Times staff photographer based in Washington, is among the photographers traveling with the president. Here are some of their best images from the trip so far. "
749,"LONDON — President Trump put his brand of confrontational and disruptive diplomacy on full display Thursday, unsettling NATO allies with a blustering performance in Brussels and then, in a remarkable breach of protocol, publicly undercutting Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain in an interview published hours after landing in her country. In the interview with The Sun, Mr. Trump second-guessed Mrs. May’s handling of the main issue on her plate: how Britain should cut ties to the European Union. He cast doubt on whether he was willing to negotiate a new trade deal between Britain and the United States, and praised Mrs. May’s Conservative Party rival, Boris Johnson, as a potentially great prime minister. The interview was published as Mr. Trump and Mrs. May were wrapping up what appeared to be a chummy dinner at Blenheim Palace — earlier, they had walked inside holding hands — and a day ahead of the president’s scheduled meeting with Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle. There was no immediate response from the British government. “Well, I think the deal that she is striking is not what the people voted on,” Mr. Trump said in the interview, speaking of the approach Mrs. May is taking to Britain’s exit from the European Union, or Brexit, under which the British economy would effectively continue to be subject to many European regulations. Speaking of Mr. Johnson, who resigned this week as foreign secretary in protest over Mrs. May’s Brexit strategy and who has long been seen as likely to challenge her for her job, Mr. Trump said: “Well, I am not pitting one against the other. I’m just saying I think he would be a great prime minister. I think he’s got what it takes and I think he’s got the right attitude to be a great prime minister.” Coming after his combative performance in Brussels with leaders of the 28 other NATO nations, the day amounted to a global disruption tour unlike anything undertaken by any other recent American president. "
750,"The reviews are in on the Season 2 finale of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” which arrived on Hulu on Wednesday, and the prevailing sentiment among fans and critics alike is: Huh? Built around a series of whiplash-inducing twists, the episode, titled “The Word,” certainly left Elisabeth Moss’s Offred in a precarious position. But did her last-minute decision make any sense? And what could the writers possibly have in store for its third season? Our (spoiler-filled) roundup of sharp criticism and revealing post-finale interviews with the cast and creator may not entirely clear up your confusion, but it should shed some light on the controversial episode. ‘“The Handmaid’s Tale” Is Brutal and Not Much Else in Season 2’ [The New York Times] In her appraisal of the season and its ending, Margaret Lyons observes that, “as ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ strays further from its origins, it also strays further from one of its significant ideas: that June is ordinary.” In her view, that quality is “one of the haunting essentials of the book, where she’s only ever called Offred, which reminds us that you don’t need to be Harry Potter or Katniss Everdeen or Jesus Christ to retain your humanity in even the most oppressive, heinous circumstances.” ‘Why Did “The Handmaid’s Tale” Season 2 Finale Have to End Like This?’ [Vanity Fair] Sonia Saraiya found the last scene of the finale ridiculous. “There’s so much about this sequence that is inexplicable to the point of incoherence,” she points out. “(To start: Is there really just one road leading out of Gilead to Canada, and if there’s just one, wouldn’t it be, I don’t know, guarded?)” Saraiya continues: “But the main problem is a deeper question concerning June’s character. ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ has spent two seasons acquainting us with June, through Moss’s harrowing performance, but there is very little in that journey to prepare us for what she chooses to do in the final moments of the season.” ‘The Truck, the Choice and the “Handmaid’s Tale” Finale’ [NPR] As far as Linda Holmes of NPR’s “Monkey See” is concerned, Offred’s request that the baby be called Nicole, as Serena Joy would have wanted, was as mystifying as her decision not to get in the car. “It is a bridge too far to narratively urge sympathy for someone who would crush those under her and actively participate in their imprisonment, their rape, and their suffering, simply because she eventually suffered a fraction of that suffering herself,” Holmes argues. “There are a lot of ways to feel about an attitude of ‘I never thought this society’s suffering would become mine, but now it is, so now I don’t like it anymore.’ But ‘Aw, she’s not so bad’ isn’t one of them.” ‘“The Handmaid’s Tale” Wraps Up a Good but Frustrating Season’ [Vulture] For Jen Chaney, who was lukewarm on the finale, the show’s efforts to humanize Serena were among the season’s highlights. “‘Handmaid’s Tale’ does something with Serena it doesn’t so much with other characters, aside from June: invest real time in her evolution,” Chaney notes. “By the time we reach the finale, we’ve learned that Serena was once a more powerful figure than her husband. We also know how much she cherishes baby Nicole, and wants the best for her. Her decision to give up Nicole because she knows the girl has no chance of reaching her full potential in Gilead is a little rushed — Serena barely has time to think about letting the infant go — but it’s ultimately believable because the show and Strahovski have demonstrated what a complicated, independent thinker dwells beneath her Commander’s Wife facade.” "
751,"WASHINGTON — The embattled F.B.I. agent who oversaw the opening of the Russia investigation mounted an aggressive defense of himself and the F.B.I. on Thursday, rejecting accusations that he let his private political views bias his official actions and labeling Republicans’ preoccupation with him “another victory notch in Putin’s belt.” “Let me be clear, unequivocally and under oath: Not once in my 26 years of defending my nation did my personal opinions impact any official action I took,” the agent, Peter Strzok, told House lawmakers investigating what Republicans say is evidence of rampant bias at the top levels of the F.B.I. But in defending himself and his agency, Mr. Strzok had to weather hours of blistering attacks by Republicans, who accused him not only of personal animus toward President Trump but also of blatant lying and moral misconduct with a senior F.B.I. lawyer, Lisa Page. It was a remarkable day of shouting matches and personal attacks that showcased the deep partisan divide over the federal investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. The performance by Republicans, echoing Mr. Trump’s own lines of attack, demonstrated just how far many in the party have moved since the days when they were seen as the party of law enforcement, deferential to its power and prerogatives. [Peter Strzok became a punching bag for Republican lawmakers after his text messages about President Trump were released. So why did he offer to testify before them? Listen to “The Daily.”] Democrats, on the other side of the now-gaping divide over the F.B.I. and Justice Department, said that Republicans, by launching their own politically motivated investigation of the investigators in an attempt to bolster Mr. Trump, were ignoring an attack by a hostile foreign power on American democracy. "
752,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean officials did not show up on Thursday for a meeting with Americans at the inter-Korean border to discuss the return of remains of United States soldiers killed in the Korean War, officials said. Kim Jong-un, the North’s leader, committed in his June talks with President Trump to repatriating American soldiers’ remains. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week, after meeting with officials in North Korea, that working-level talks on the matter would be held on or around Thursday in Panmunjom, the “truce village” on the border between North and South Korea. Though American military officials went to Panmunjom for the meeting on Thursday, their North Korean counterparts did not, according to a United States defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. A South Korean government official, who also asked for anonymity, confirmed that the North Koreans had not shown up at Panmunjom. It was not clear whether the Americans had been deliberately stood up. Mr. Pompeo had cautioned that the date for the planned meeting at Panmunjom “could move by one day or two,” indicating that the two sides had not settled all the details before he left Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on Saturday. When the American officials called the North Korean side at Panmunjom later on Thursday, it proposed a generals’ meeting with the United States on Sunday, South Korean officials said. If the Pentagon accepts the proposal, it will be the first meeting between North Korean and American military generals in nine years. Mr. Pompeo said his discussions in Pyongyang last week had been productive, though he left without a North Korean agreement to take specific steps toward dismantling its nuclear weapons program. North Korea later said it was seriously disappointed by Mr. Pompeo’s visit, accusing him of making a “unilateral and gangster-like demand for denuclearization,” while failing to offer corresponding American incentives to improve ties between the two countries.

753,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. It’s just become trickier for President Trump to fire Robert Mueller anytime soon. Doing so during the Supreme Court confirmation process for Brett Kavanaugh — which is likely to last for at least two months — would create a set of problems for Trump that didn’t exist before. I count three main reasons: One, Trump clearly loves making Supreme Court nominations. They allow him to look presidential and to be bathed in praise by other Republicans. If he were to fire Mueller — the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the election — anytime in the coming weeks, the confirmation process would immediately lose its normalcy. It would be dominated by discussion of Mueller’s Russia investigation, which Trump loathes and makes him look like the opposite of a normal president. Two, firing Mueller could damage the Republicans’ chances of holding Congress in this year’s midterms. It’s true that most voters aren’t currently paying much attention to the Russia investigation. But if Trump tried to end that investigation, it would immediately create the kind of chaos that typically hurts the party in the White House. As is, the Supreme Court nomination has some real political advantages for Republicans. It unifies their base voters and reminds them of reasons to turn out. And it turns the discussion away from Trump, who remains unpopular. Finally, firing Mueller could damage Kavanaugh’s chances of confirmation. As I’ve written before, I would be very surprised if any Senate Republicans defected. But their margin for error is virtually zero. Losing a single senator could defeat the nomination. And the circus that would accompany the firing of Mueller could certainly imperil one vote. "
754,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Three important buildings, designed by three important architects, tell the story of modern Los Angeles and its newspaper. The first was designed by Gordon B. Kaufmann and built in 1935 as a new and modern home for The Los Angeles Times, and its distinctive Art Deco style has been an iconic fixture of the city’s skyline. The second, designed by Rowland H. Crawford, is an office tower built in 1948 as the home for a new afternoon newspaper. That project failed, partly because the old street cars went away as the city embraced the automobile, but the building endures. The third was designed by William L. Pereira, a 1973 office building to accommodate the top brass of the Times Mirror Co., the newspaper’s corporate parent. It was built at a time when the paper was growing under the publisher, Otis Chandler, who expanded the paper’s coverage, elevating it into the upper echelon of the country’s great newspapers. Together they are known as Times Mirror Square, and now that the staff of The Los Angeles Times is moving to another section of the county, conservationists are fighting to save the building from development plans by the complex’s owner, the Onni Group. “These three buildings tell the story not just of The Los Angeles Times, but of Los Angeles,” said Richard Schave, a local conservationist and historian who runs the tour company Esotouric. "
755,"LONDON — The protesters began assembling even before Air Force One touched down outside London on Thursday. They inflated a giant orange balloon depicting President Trump as a pouting baby, wearing a diaper and wielding a smartphone. They jeered as the helicopter Marine One took off to ferry Mr. Trump to a black-tie gala dinner outside Oxford with Prime Minister Theresa May. Outside the dinner, at Blenheim Palace, where Churchill was born, a heavy police presence kept around 1,000 chanting demonstrators far away as Mr. Trump and Mrs. May, along with their spouses, were serenaded by trumpeters and other members of a military band. Mr. Trump’s long-delayed first visit to Britain as president was supposed to cement ties with America’s closest ally, reassure a nation anxious over the chaotic process of exiting the European Union and give Mr. Trump a relaxing weekend in Scotland, where his mother was born and where he owns two golf courses. But British protesters saw in the visit a chance to register their displeasure at Mr. Trump’s policies. The demonstrations will culminate in a march on Friday — with the baby balloon flying overhead — that is expected to be one of the nation’s largest rallies since the 2003 protests against the American- and British-led invasion of Iraq. “He needs to be called out,” said Harley Day, 23, a student who was among the protesters assembled in Regent’s Park in West London. “His bigotry, his sexism, his Islamophobia, his general xenophobia and crass inability to empathize.” The demonstrators received tactical and rhetorical support from Sadiq Khan, a son of Pakistani immigrants who is the first Muslim to serve as mayor of London. The president has accused the mayor of being weak on terrorism; the mayor has called the president a menace to democracy, and also signed off on the flying of the giant balloon. "
756,How things have changed. 
757,"The federal government has quietly revived its investigation into the murder of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old African-American boy whose abduction and killing remains, almost 63 years later, among the starkest and most searing examples of racial violence in the South. The Justice Department said that its renewed inquiry, which it described in a report submitted to Congress in late March, was “based upon the discovery of new information.” It is not clear, though, whether the government will be able to bring charges against anyone: Most episodes investigated in recent years as part of a federal effort to re-examine racially motivated murders have not led to prosecutions, or even referrals to state authorities. The Justice Department declined to comment on Thursday, but it appeared that the government had chosen to devote new attention to the case after a central witness, Carolyn Bryant Donham, recanted parts of her account of what transpired in August 1955. Two men who confessed to killing Emmett, only after they had been acquitted by an all-white jury in Mississippi, are dead. [Read about the woman linked to the 1955 murder of Emmett Till] Yet the Till case, which staggered the nation after the boy’s open-coffin funeral and the publication of photographs of his mutilated body, has never faded away, especially in a region still grappling with the horrors of its past. Even in recent years, historical markers about the case have been vandalized. “I don’t think this is something the South is going to forget easily,” said Joyce Chiles, a former district attorney in Mississippi who was involved in a mid-2000s review of the Till case that concluded with no new charges. For more than six decades, Emmett’s death has stood as a symbol of Southern racism. The boy was visiting family in Money, Miss., deep in the Mississippi Delta, from Chicago when he went to a store owned by Ms. Donham and her then husband, who was one of the men who ultimately confessed to Emmett’s murder. Emmett was kidnapped and killed days later, his body tethered to a cotton gin fan with barbed wire and then cast into a river. "
758,"BRUSSELS — NATO, a pillar of the global order, emerged from a two-day confrontation with President Trump on Thursday intact but distracted and shaken, a further challenge to the alliance as it faces an expansionist Russia and growing authoritarianism among some of its own members. Wrapping up talks with fellow leaders of the 29-nation trans-Atlantic alliance, Mr. Trump reaffirmed support for NATO, but only after stirring more discord with a vague threat that the United States could go its own way if the allies resisted his demands for additional military spending, capping a summit meeting punctuated by his escalating complaints. Hours later, after landing in Britain, the assault on diplomatic norms continued. In an interview with the newspaper The Sun, published late Thursday, he undercut Prime Minister Theresa May on several fronts on her own turf. In the midst of a week that has seen Mrs. May parrying threats to her hold on power, Mr. Trump criticized her strategy on cutting ties to the European Union, cast doubt on whether he was willing to negotiate a new trade deal between Britain and the United States and praised Mrs. May’s Conservative party rival, Boris Johnson, who resigned this week as foreign secretary, as a potentially great prime minister. The entire day, from Brussels to London, was one unsettling experience after another for members of the Western alliance. Mixing pique, self-congratulation and a relentless focus on whether the United States is being taken advantage of by its closest allies, Mr. Trump spent his final hours at the NATO meeting in Brussels bludgeoning other leaders but got little in the way of concrete results. "
759,"BRUSSELS — As President Trump prepared to leave the NATO summit meeting in his disgruntled wake, the story of his visit could be told in the tight smiles, stiff handshakes and averted gazes he exchanged with the people who are supposed to be some of his closest European allies. With few leaders willing to publicly push back against Mr. Trump’s aggressive haggling over military spending, observers were left to study his body language, as well as that of his allies and aides. At times, attempts to decipher the mood of the president and other heads of state felt akin to studying a very sophisticated and multilingual high school cafeteria. For starters, there appeared to be cliques, with a grimacing Mr. Trump often on the outs. As leaders prepared for a so-called (and perhaps dysfunctional) family photo, Mr. Trump’s contemporaries walked ahead and chatted together while the president hung back with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president. During a group photo shoot, leaders seemed to glance at Mr. Trump out of the corners of their eyes, if they looked at him at all. The coverage of the icy-appearing exchanges caught the attention of at least two high-profile White House aides, who were quick to declare the analysis “fake news.” “Fake News Media outlets FAIL to mention the photo of President @realDonaldTrump looking up toward the sky with others,” Dan Scavino, the president’s social media director, wrote on Twitter, “is that of an impressive flyover of helicopters from 13 Alied Nations as seen here off the reflection of the @NATO building. Way to go FAKE NEWS!” "
760,"Good Thursday. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Walt Disney and Comcast may not be fighting over 21st Century Fox any more. The two giants instead look likely to focus their efforts on buying control of Sky, the European satellite broadcaster that Fox has a stake in. Fox took the lead over Comcast in the Sky bidding yesterday morning, offering (with Disney’s blessing) £14 a share. By last night, Comcast took it back, offering £14.75 a share. Sky’s independent board committee quickly switched its recommendation from Fox to Comcast. There’s a regulatory wrinkle here: If Disney and Comcast were to raise their offers for Fox, they both believe, Britain’s Takeover Code would force them to offer more for Sky as well. That’s a reason to keep their eyes on the European prize — meaning the fight for Sky may only intensify. The social network will start erasing tens of millions of suspect followers from user accounts today, in a bid for renewed trust. The move follows an NYT investigation in January into the fake accounts industry, which helps some Twitter users inflate their influence. Advertisers, who were questioning the value of Twitter “influencers,” praised the crackdown. And since the company omits suspected fake accounts from its monthly active user totals, this won’t hurt its quarterly reports. Twitter’s already riding high. "
761,"For nearly 40 years, the gender gap in voting has been the subject of continued speculation. How much does it matter? Would it be wide enough to put Democrats in office? Now, with President Trump ascendant, the question becomes still more urgent: What happens if the gender gap becomes a gender chasm? On July 7, CNN predicted that the 2018 election would “have the largest gender gap on record for a midterm election since 1958.” On the same day, Dan Balz, my former colleague at The Washington Post, wrote: Polling data this year clearly suggests that women are moving away from the Republican Party. The potential gender gap in congressional voting has risen from 20 and 22 points in 2014 and 2016, according to exit polls, to 33 points in a Quinnipiac Poll published earlier this month. Men of all races say they intend to vote for Republican House candidates 50-42, while women of all races say they intend to vote for Democratic candidates 58-33. Significantly, white women, a majority of whom backed Trump in 2016, now say they intend to vote for Democratic House candidates in 2018 by a 14-point margin, 52-38, according to Quinnipiac. White men say they intend to vote for Republican House candidates 56-38 in 2018. Polling also suggests that Trump could do better in 2020 among men than he did in 2016, but his approval ratings among women of all races are dismal. The Washington Post-Schar School poll conducted June 27-July 2 found that men of all races approve of how Trump is handling the job by 54-45, while women of all races disapprove, 65-32, a 42-point gap. (The gap is determined in this way: If there were no difference between men and women, the gap would be zero. Using this case as an example, men are plus nine on Trump and women are minus 33, which produces a total gap of 42 points.) In 2016, Trump won white men 56.05 to 36.61, carrying white men without college degrees 61.20 to 31.82, while barely losing white men with degrees, 46.60 to 45.30, according to the Cooperative Congressional Election Study. In 2016, Trump carried white women, 51.86 to 43.15 — winning white women without college degrees 58.17 to 37.25 and losing white women with degrees 38.38 to 55.73. "

763,"With apologies to “Animal House’s” Otter, Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court is not the time “a really futile and stupid gesture be done on somebody’s part.” Then again, Otter’s frat brother Bluto did go on to become a United States senator, so maybe it makes sense. I refer to the decision of Senate Democrats to wage a tooth-and-nail battle to oppose Kavanaugh, an effort that is likely doomed to fail and equally likely to hurt Democratic chances in the fall. Who knew Chuck Schumer was so content with his job as Senate minority leader? Let’s count the ways in which the Democrats aren’t helping themselves. Kavanaugh will almost certainly be confirmed. Democrats who had pinned their hopes on flipping Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski probably aren’t going to get their wish, since both Republican moderates voted to confirm Kavanaugh to his current judgeship in 2006 and have since spoken approvingly of his nomination. Rand Paul can also be counted on to feign political independence, but he usually falls into line. Of course it’s possible Kavanaugh will make a bad public impression, like Robert Bork. Or maybe there will be a #MeToo revelation, like with Clarence Thomas. Or maybe Democrats will figure out a way to kick a vote past the midterms. In which case, Democrats can seize their chances. For now, however, the first question Democrats ought to ask themselves is whether they really have political capital to waste on a losing battle. Fierce opposition to Kavanaugh hurts Democrats. This was already going to be a difficult year for Senate Democrats, who are defending 10 seats in states won by Trump. Everyone knows that North Dakota’s Heidi Heitkamp, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin and Indiana’s Joe Donnelly are vulnerable, which is why they voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch last year. Florida’s Bill Nelson is struggling, too, as is Missouri’s Claire McCaskill. So please explain the logic of convincing Democratic voters in these states that the Kavanaugh nomination is the moral battle of our time — and then putting their senators to the choice of looking like political sellouts if they vote for Kavanaugh, or moral cowards if they don’t (and vice versa)? "
764,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump strongly recommitted his support for the military alliance today, saying on the second and final day of a summit meeting in Brussels that members had agreed to increases in military spending. But he offered no specifics, and President Emmanuel Macron of France refuted the claim. We have live updates. “The United States was not being treated fairly, but now we are,” the president said at a news conference after NATO leaders held an emergency meeting to address his complaints. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump again demanded that allies meet a commitment to raise their military budgets, and then surprised them by saying they should double that spending target. He also criticized Germany for being a “captive” of Russia’s energy supply. (Our fact-check suggests otherwise.) The president did, however, join other NATO leaders in signing a statement that harshly criticized Russia, days before he is to meet with its leader, Vladimir Putin. • Mr. Trump has now arrived in Britain, which he recently described as being somewhat in turmoil. His visit, which is expected to be greeted by protests, could test the “special relationship” between London and Washington. "
765,"Gary Hendler’s application for a presidential pardon runs nearly 80 pages, detailing the places he has lived, the jobs he’s had, the schools attended, any drug use, debts, good works and a full and contrite account of the crime that led him to this point. He even has a letter of support from his probation officer. Mr. Hendler, who pleaded guilty in 1984 to a drug charge, was optimistic about receiving a pardon from President Barack Obama, who had pushed a more-forgiving policy for nonviolent crimes. But that opportunity came and went. A new president took over, and with him, apparently a new way of doing things. First came a pardon for Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff convicted of criminal contempt, whose case had been promoted by the right-wing radio host Alex Jones. Then one for a former Navy sailor whose case was a conservative cause célèbre. And in June, after a trip to the White House by Kim Kardashian West, a commutation arrived for Alice Johnson, who was serving a life sentence on drug charges. Mr. Hendler realized he needed a new strategy. “Kellyanne Conway lives just down the beach from me on the Jersey Shore,” he said of the White House counselor. “I could get her to say something to Trump.” He knows how to reach Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor. And oh! Tucker Carlson’s sister-in-law — he rents a place to her. “I guess this is how it works now,” Mr. Hendler said. Few constitutional powers lie so wholly at the whims of the president as the power to pardon. No details need to be worked out beforehand and no agency apparatus is needed to carry a pardon out. The president declares a person officially forgiven, and it is so. A layer of government lawyers has long worked behind the scenes, screening the hundreds of petitions each year, giving the process the appearance of objectivity and rigor. But technically — legally — this is unnecessary. A celebrity game show approach to mercy, doling the favor out to those with political allegiance or access to fame, is fully within the law. "
766,"The Times’s former chief book critic, and author of “The Death of Truth,” doesn’t think in terms of genre: “J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter books are no more Y.A. reading, to me, than John le Carré’s Smiley novels are spy stories.” What books are on your nightstand? Too many books for the nightstand, I’m afraid — more like two (sometimes three) tottering piles on the floor, including these: “Tyrant: Shakespeare on Politics,” by Stephen Greenblatt; “Small Country,” by Gaël Faye; “Flash: The Making of Weegee the Famous,” by Christopher Bonanos; “There There,” by Tommy Orange; “Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now,” by Jaron Lanier; “Going Into Town: A Love Letter to New York,” by Roz Chast; “OK, Mr. Field,” by Katharine Kilalea; “The Soul of America: The Battle for Our Better Angels,” by Jon Meacham; “Hero of the Empire: The Boer War, a Daring Escape, and the Making of Winston Churchill,” by Candice Millard; “Barracoon: The Story of the Last ‘Black Cargo,” by Zora Neale Hurston; and “Secondhand Time: The Last of the Soviets,” by Svetlana Alexievich. Does your appreciation of a book correlate with your interest in reviewing it? Is it easier to review books you admire or ones you think deserve criticism? One of my favorite things, as a critic, was finding books by new writers who possessed a distinctive voice and vision, an inventive gift for storytelling. I also loved immersing myself in works of nonfiction that taught me something about the world, that made the past come alive or shed light on hidden corners of history or the news. I’d much rather share my enthusiasm for works I admired, than dissect the reasons I had problems with a book — or sift politicians’ accounts about, say, the Iraq war, for lies, omissions and spin. I felt a responsibility as a journalist to review such books, and situate them in context; but like most readers, I always looked forward to being captivated by a book. I wanted to be surprised, inspired, awed. Which books were most instrumental to you in writing your new book? In “The Death of Truth,” I wanted to look at how we got to where we are today — with reason, science and the rule of law under assault from a president who lies shamelessly and reflexively, and at least a third of the country willing to dwell in a world of “alternative facts.” In examining the fallout that dishonesty and the denial of objective truth are having on our democracy, I went back to the writings of thinkers like Hannah Arendt (“The Origins of Totalitarianism”) and George Orwell (“1984,” “A Collection of Essays”) who chronicled how cynicism and weariness and fear can make people susceptible to propaganda, and the lies and false promises of leaders bent on unconditional power. The words of America’s founders are also uncannily prescient: Washington’s Farewell Address, for instance, warns of the dangers of demagoguery, extreme partisanship and the loss of shared ideals, while “The Federalist Papers” (authored by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay) provides an impassioned and fiercely rational defense of the Constitution and the essential role that the separation of powers plays in protecting our liberty.

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. President Trump began his trip to Europe by issuing broadside attacks against NATO in general and Germany specifically. Trump suggested that Germany’s reliance on Russia for much of its natural gas meant it was “totally controlled by Russia.” (Read our fact-check here.) On “The Late Show,” Stephen Colbert lamented the president’s remarks, but he didn’t sound surprised. Colbert said that Trump seemed to be using his claims about Germany to distract from his own relationship with the Kremlin. Colbert also touched on the latest news about Trump’s dealings with North Korea. Reports emerged on Wednesday about the meeting that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had with North Korean diplomats last week — and the details didn’t sound promising. "
768,"The Trump administration said Thursday that it had complied with a judge’s order and reunited all of the eligible children under the age of 5 that it had in custody with their migrant parents. But Nazario Jacinto-Carrillo’s desperate voice and haunting questions, repeated over and over on a phone line from Guatemala, made clear that the crisis over child separations remained far from resolved. “When are they going to give them back?” Mr. Jacinto-Carrillo asked of the thousands of children still in custody. He had trekked to the United States with his 5-year-old daughter, Filomena. He was deported. She remains in foster care in New York, where she recently turned 6. “I want her back in Guatemala,” he pleaded. Administration officials told reporters that the government had reunited 57 of the 103 migrant children under the age of 5, complying with a judicial order. The other 46 were deemed “ineligible” for a variety of reasons. Some of their parents had been accused of crimes. One parent had a communicable disease. In a dozen cases, the parents had been deported already without their children, making their reunification more challenging. And that’s just the youngest of the child detainees. There are nearly 3,000 children in detention across the United States, the vast majority from Central America, who fall between ages 5 and 17. Reunification with their parents is now underway as the government scrambles to meet a court-imposed deadline of July 26. Mr. Jacinto-Carrillo’s daughter, given her age, appeared to be in the second group. Exactly how the government plans to reunify parents such as Mr. Jacinto-Carrillo, who were sent back home without their children, remains to be seen. Officials said they had no plans to allow the parents to re-enter the country. “We don’t have the legal authority to bring these individuals back into the country for reunification purposes,” said Matthew Albence, executive director of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, the detention and deportation division. "
769,"In the end, the arrest at an Ohio strip club of Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film star who said she had an affair with Donald J. Trump before he became president, was quickly resolved because of one fact: she was not a regular employee of the club. Ms. Clifford, who performs under the name Stormy Daniels, simply had a two-night gig at the Sirens Gentlemen’s Club in Columbus. That distinction resulted in the three misdemeanor charges of illegal sexual activity that were brought against Ms. Clifford after her Wednesday night arrest being dropped on Thursday afternoon. The Columbus police later said that they had made a mistake in making the arrest. But in the less than 24 hours that Ms. Clifford was arrested, charged, bailed out and released, the episode, widely reported in the national media, generated questions. Was the arrest of Ms. Clifford — who has gained nationwide prominence for her accusations against President Trump — politically motivated? Why was it even a priority to send four detectives to a strip club? The episode began about 10 p.m. Wednesday when four vice detectives from the Columbus Police Department were sent to Sirens in northeastern Columbus to investigate complaints “alleging prostitution and drug activity,” court documents show. "
770,"For live updates of President Trump’s visit to Britain, go here. Only a few hours into his trip to the U.K., Britons learned that the American president who had just shaken up NATO allies in Brussels was not out of the provocation business. Around the time a dinner in Mr. Trump’s honor was taking place at an Oxfordshire palace, word spread that he had given an interview highly critical of the dinner’s host. That would be Prime Minister Theresa May. And so ended Day 1. Some highlights of the trip so far: • Mr. Trump, fresh from breaking eggs in Brussels, was back in form in Britain, telling a newspaper that Prime Minister May was mishandling the Brexit talks. • Shortly after he arrived at the ambassador’s residence and again outside the dinner, protesters began to make their voices heard. • Earlier in the day, in Brussels, Mr. Trump said NATO allies had agreed to his demand for a significant increase in military spending, but other leaders offered differing accounts. Mr. Trump said he remained committed to the alliance. • The New York Times has live coverage of his seven-day, three-nation trip, from our White House reporters and European correspondents. Photographs from Mr. Trump’s weeklong trip are here. "
771,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — The heartbreaking scenes on the southern border seem a world away from recent presidential pardons. Sobbing children and bereft parents have nothing in common with Joe Arpaio, Dinesh D’Souza and, most recently, the Oregon ranchers Dwight Hammond and his son, Steven, who had been convicted of arson in 2016 and whom President Trump pardoned on Tuesday. Yet both come down to a relationship between justice and mercy that has a long history — and a cautionary moral for the president. Family separation shows justice without mercy. The pardon power displays mercy in the name of justice. The administration cites the biblical injunction to obey the powers that be as one explanation for its zero-tolerance policy on immigration. With regard to immigration, it seems, there can be no discretion. By contrast, presidential pardons show how extensive discretion can be, because the Constitution gives the president “power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in case of impeachment.” Most Enlightenment thinkers were uneasy about the pardoning power. The two greatest oracles for the Constitution’s framers, the French philosopher Montesquieu and the English lawyer William Blackstone, both attacked it. “Clemency is the characteristic of monarchs,” wrote Montesquieu, who thought it inappropriate in republics. Blackstone was adamant. “In democracies,” he thundered, “this power of pardon can never subsist.” Contemporary reformers like Cesare Beccaria and Jeremy Bentham were just as skeptical about pardons. So was Immanuel Kant, for whom it was one of the slipperiest rights of the sovereign, a majestic encouragement to injustice. Eighteenth-century Europeans didn’t have to look far to find examples to prove their case. At his trial for treason in 1649, King Charles I of England had denied the authority of the court set up by Parliament on the grounds that “no earthly power can justly call me (who am your King) in question as a delinquent.” Yet the court insisted on its authority to try him and he was convicted of “a wicked design to erect and uphold in himself an unlimited and tyrannical power to rule according to his will.” In the later 17th century, Parliament proceeded to crimp the royal prerogative until little residue of an absolute monarch’s godlike capacity remained in the hands of George III. In this sense the American Constitution actually pushed back against Europe’s anti-monarchical movement. The framers argued that “without an easy access to exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt, justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel,” as Alexander Hamilton argued in Federalist 74. This was particularly true in “season of insurrection or rebellion,” Hamilton continued, “when a well-timed offer of pardon to the insurgents or rebels may restore the tranquillity of the commonwealth.” With the ratification of the Constitution, George Washington received an array of powers many European monarchs might have envied. The president could veto legislation — something no British monarch had done since 1707. He was commander in chief of the armed forces; 1743 was the last time a British king had led an army, at the Battle of Dettingen. And after 1789, the French revolutionaries abolished the pardoning power that America’s elective monarch now retained. "
772,"Peter Strzok, the embattled F.B.I. agent who oversaw the opening of the Russia investigation, appeared on Thursday before the House Judiciary and Oversight committees.

774,"Divided administrations produce incoherent diplomacy. That’s why President Trump’s meeting next Monday in Helsinki, Finland, with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is unlikely to go well. In their preparations for the summit, Mr. Trump and his advisers appeared to recognize the need for greater discipline and focus. These could, if sustained, be the ingredients of a more promising phase in Russian-American relations. But to reach that goal, Mr. Trump has to accept something he will find extremely distasteful — a diminished role for himself. Few new presidents have been so completely at odds with their top advisers on a major foreign policy problem as Mr. Trump has always been on Russia. He is guided by a longstanding desire to “get along” with Mr. Putin; the senior members of his team start with deep suspicion and hostility. A paralyzing confusion has been the result. That may be changing — and on some of the most sensitive issues dividing Moscow and Washington. When Secretary of State Mike Pompeo assured Congress last month that Mr. Trump would take a firm stand in Helsinki on election meddling, the president’s immediate response (on Twitter) was to remind us that according to the Russians, meddling never happened. Then, as though someone had advised him this was the wrong answer, he changed course. “We don’t want anybody tampering with elections,” he told an interviewer. The president also let others tidy up his foolish remarks on Ukraine. After he said he might consider recognizing Russia’s seizure of Crimea in 2014, his national security adviser, John Bolton, called that view “not the position of the United States.” All the president meant, Mr. Bolton insisted, was that he would hear Mr. Putin out. Soon Mr. Trump shrugged off his earlier statement. “I’ll talk to him about everything,” he explained. All this looks like the same division of labor the president and his principal advisers used at the Singapore summit with Kim Jong-un. It’s a formula in which Mr. Trump manages the spectacle — the feel-good, ego-boosting, backslapping engagement — while Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Bolton manage the policy. They let the president glory in the main event as they try to control both the run-up and the substantive aftermath. The Singapore model, it has to be said, did not keep Mr. Trump from mismanaging his meeting with Mr. Kim. Could it, even so, enable the administration to refashion Russian-American relations? Maybe, but only if three conditions are met. "
775,"WASHINGTON — The trade war between the United States and China showed no signs of yielding on Thursday, as Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, told lawmakers there was no clear path to resolution and Beijing blasted the administration over its approach. Mr. Mnuchin, who has tried to avoid calling the trade tensions with China a “war,” said talks with Beijing had “broken down” and suggested it was now up to China to come to the table with concessions. President Trump, speaking in Brussels on Thursday, described the trade talks with China as a “nasty” battle. The Chinese, meanwhile, accused the United States of “acting erratically” and said the administration had “blatantly abandoned the consensuses that two sides have reached and insisted on fighting a trade war with China.” Republicans and Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee showed little patience for Mr. Mnuchin’s answers about the lack of progress, repeatedly pressing him about whether there was a strategy to resolve the trade war and expressing concern that it was starting to hurt parts of the economy. The White House has already hit Beijing with tariffs on $34 billion worth of imports and China has responded with a similar amount of levies on American goods, including soybeans, pork and cars. On Tuesday, the administration outlined tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese products, including many consumer products like furniture, dog leashes and fish. “Is there a master plan?” asked Representative Mia Love, Republican of Utah. “I implore you to work to end this thing soon.” "
776,"A Supreme Court vacancy is the closest Washington gets to a soap opera. Even if you don’t normally pay attention to what happens on Capitol Hill, the spectacle of putting a new justice on the nation’s highest court can be hard to resist. It’s the stuff they make movies out of. And so when President Trump announced Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh as his nominee for the Supreme Court this week (read more about that here), he unleashed a cascade of questions: about the judge himself, the confirmation process, and what role it will all play in November’s midterm elections. We’re here to answer some of those questions — and others you might have over the next few months. If you have a question about Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation process or how it may affect the elections, email us at supremecourt@nytimes.com. [Sign up here for First Draft, The Times’s politics newsletter | Here’s what’s coming up next on the primary calendar.] There are two public relations campaigns happening now. The first is from the White House, working to convince the Senate to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. The second is from members of Congress (or candidates who would like to be), who are staring down a potentially divisive moment less than four months before the crucial midterms. The White House has lined up dozens of Judge Kavanaugh’s former clerks to vouch for him as he meets with senators on the Hill; Times reporters looked at how the battle lines are being drawn through the Senate chamber. The court vacancy could help Republicans keep control of the Senate in November, while simultaneously helping the Democrats seize control of the House, writes Carl Hulse, the chief Washington correspondent for The Times. Read that story here. To understand such a seemingly contradictory election outcome, Times politics reporters Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin spoke this week to candidates who were staking their claims around the nomination process. “The prospect of an election-year abortion debate is far more unsettling to Republicans, and could fire up already-energized liberals while cleaving centrist women from the G.O.P.,” they wrote.  Read that story here. No one knows yet. The White House would like a confirmation vote before the court’s new term begins on Oct. 1. Charlie Savage, a legal policy correspondent for The Times, broke down Judge Kavanaugh’s years of legal rulings here. He looked at the decisions on abortion rights, religion, gun rights, climate regulations and other issues to explore what sort of justice the judge might turn out to be. One key piece of Judge Kavanaugh’s writings has been the subject of much discussion this week: he once argued President Clinton could be impeached for misleading the public. He has since retreated from that argument, and Wednesday’s episode of “The Daily” explored that change of heart; listen to it here. "
777,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. A chaotic end to the NATO summit meeting. President Trump claimed he had persuaded other countries to increase their military spending, but European leaders quickly refuted the claim. He affirmed his commitment to the alliance, however, despite his previous skepticism and criticism. Mr. Trump is now in Britain, where he will meet with Prime Minister Theresa May (including at a dinner, above) and other politicians — and try to steer clear of widespread organized protests. The visit will test the U.S.’s “special relationship” with Britain, coming at a time of political turmoil in the U.K. Here’s what’s at stake. _____ "
778,"The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s plans for a crisis in Puerto Rico were based on a focused disaster like a tsunami, not a major hurricane devastating the whole island. The agency vastly underestimated how much food and fresh water it would need, and how hard it would be to get additional supplies to the island. And when the killer storm did come, FEMA’s warehouse in Puerto Rico was nearly empty, its contents rushed to aid the United States Virgin Islands, which were hammered by another storm two weeks before. There was not a single tarpaulin or cot left in stock. Those and other shortcomings are detailed in a FEMA report assessing the agency’s response to the 2017 storm season, when three major hurricanes slammed the United States in quick succession, leaving FEMA struggling to deliver food and water quickly to storm victims in Puerto Rico. The after-action report describes an initially chaotic and disorganized relief effort on the island that was plagued with logistical problems and stretched into the longest feeding mission in the agency’s history. The report confirms many of the criticisms that have been leveled at the agency, especially in Puerto Rico, which President Trump visited a few weeks after Hurricane Maria and complained that the disaster “threw our budget a little out of whack.” At the time, the island’s hospitals were struggling to function, shortages of diesel fuel were keeping supermarkets closed and generators idle, and the death rate on the island was soaring. The 2017 hurricane season in the United States was the most destructive on record. According to the report, nearly five million people registered for FEMA assistance last year, exceeding the combined total from four previous major hurricanes — Rita, Wilma, Katrina and Sandy. The 2017 storms caused a total of $265 billion in damage and badly stretched FEMA’s capacity to respond. "
779,"“Full Frontal With Samantha Bee” received seven Emmy Award nominations this year, including one in the variety talk series category. Ms. Bee has had a busy season: Earlier this year, she debuted an hourlong special focusing on Puerto Rico’s recovery after Hurricane Irma (for which the show received three of its nominations). She also found herself in a wave of controversy after she used a vulgar term to describe Ivanka Trump during a segment about the separation of migrant children from their parents at the United States border. Ms. Bee spoke about these issues by phone on Thursday afternoon. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. [Read about the nominations. | See the list of nominees.] What do you think the show’s mission is, and has it evolved since Trump was elected? Obviously, we are following the content that means the most to us, and unfortunately, this administration has been so busy being so destructive, we often get caught up in what it is that they’re doing. So it’s not that the mission itself has changed; it hasn’t. It’s just that the amount of news that we’re kind of drowning under has changed. That is the unique experience, but I think every show like ours is similarly experiencing it. I think every human being living in America and abroad right now is kind of overwhelmed by the amount of news pouring out of the White House. I think that, you know, we’ll always aim to be an audacious show. But it’s topical, and a lot of our topical comedy does align with the current temperature of things. Two of the nominations you received were for your hourlong special on Puerto Rico. I’m really so thrilled about that. It was really a labor of love for us, for sure. That feels very special to me. "
780,"So Donald Trump went to a NATO summit, insulted our allies, then made the absurd demand not just that they increase defense spending — which they should — but that they raise it to 4 percent of G.D.P., much higher than the bloated military spending in his own budget. He then claimed, falsely, to have won major concessions, and graciously declared that it is “presently unnecessary” to consider quitting the alliance. Was there anything our allies could have done that would have mollified him? The answer, surely, is no. For Trump, disrupting NATO doesn’t seem to be a means to an end; it’s an end in itself. Does all of this sound familiar? It’s basically the same as the story of the escalating trade war. While Trump rants about other countries’ unfair trade practices — a complaint that has some validity for China, although virtually none for Canada or the European Union — he hasn’t made any coherent demands. That is, he has given no indication what any of the countries hit by his tariffs could do to satisfy him, leaving them with no option except retaliation. So he isn’t acting like someone threatening a trade war to win concessions; he’s acting like someone who just wants a trade war. Sure enough, he’s reportedly threatening to pull out of the World Trade Organization, the same way he’s suggesting that the U.S. might pull out of NATO. It’s all of a piece. Whatever claims Trump makes about other countries’ misbehavior, whatever demands he makes on a particular day, they’re all in evident bad faith. Mr. Art of the Deal doesn’t want any deals. He just wants to tear things down. The institutions Trump is trying to destroy were all created under U.S. leadership in the aftermath of World War II. Those were years of epic statesmanship — the years of the Berlin airlift and the Marshall Plan, in which America showed its true greatness. For having won the war, we chose not to behave like a conqueror, but instead to build the foundations of lasting peace. "
781,"LONDON — For months, British officials laid plans to make sure that President Trump, a fan of ornate housing, will see a castle or two on his visit to England after the NATO gathering. The British also know that in addition to loving all things gilded, Mr. Trump is a longtime Winston Churchill fan, and that since becoming president, he has tried to cast himself in the image of the World War II prime minister. So it is no accident that Mr. Trump began his visit to England on Thursday evening by having dinner at Blenheim Palace, the Oxfordshire birthplace and family home of Churchill. Theresa May, Britain’s prime minister, would have only a few hours to warm up Mr. Trump on defense and trade issues, and to remind him of the value of the special relationship between the United States and Britain, while he was here on a whirlwind, mostly-by-helicopter stay. By welcoming Mr. Trump to Blenheim, Mrs. May and other senior officials were pulling out the stops to try to dazzle a president who they know likes dazzle. But before the night was even over, Mr. Trump, in an interview with The Sun, criticized Mrs. May’s approach to Brexit. The evening began with a ceremony featuring Scottish, Irish and Welsh guards playing “Amazing Grace.” The four trumpeters were from the Household Cavalry Band, which played for the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. They had on pure gold cloaks worn only in the presence of the queen or a head of state. "
782,"Kim Gordon is standing on a wooden platform in Reena Spaulings Fine Art, a gallery on the second floor of an unassuming building in Manhattan’s Chinatown that is rumored to have once housed a brothel. She is surrounded by white plinths displaying painted small-scale sculptures — upended cans and funny-shaped boxes — all fabricated from cardboard by the Swiss artist Peter Fischli. The work seems to be, in part, a vaguely Duchampian commentary on the line between everyday object and valuable sculpture. “It’s almost kind of a takeoff of art for people who are afraid of art,” Gordon appraises. She carefully makes her way around the room, and it’s hard to ignore the symbolism: The co-founder of the groundbreaking experimental rock band Sonic Youth, the godmother of grunge, the feminist icon, is quite literally wandering around a field of pedestals. It is an unseasonably hot and muggy June day — New York at its most New York — but Gordon, languid and cool, seems to exist within her own ecosystem. At 65, she wears her choppy blonde hair in girlish bangs and has the surfer drawl of a native Southern Californian. A few years ago, after three and a half decades on the East Coast and the thunderous breakup of both her band and her long marriage to Thurston Moore, her collaborator in Sonic Youth, Gordon moved back to her childhood hometown, Los Angeles. Kim Gordon appears on one of the seven covers of T’s recent Culture issue. Read more about New York City, 1981-1983: 36 months that changed the culture. “After my marriage ended, I think my biggest fear was actually having to get a real job,” she says once we’ve sat down to lunch at a Greek restaurant a few blocks from the gallery. But the post-divorce years have proved creatively prolific. Musically, she’s embarked on a series of collaborations (with Stephen Malkmus and Peaches, among others); recorded her first-ever single under her own name, “Murdered Out,” a “sort of trashy” industrial track with producer Justin Raisen; and thrown herself into a new band, an improvisational noise guitar duo with the Western Massachusetts-based musician Bill Nace called Body/Head. There have also been modeling gigs — for Ugg, Proenza Schouler and Rodarte — and acting gigs: small roles on “Girls” and in the new Gus Van Sant movie, “Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot.” In 2015, Gordon published the New York Times best-selling memoir “Girl in a Band.” The occasion for our conversation is Body/Head’s latest album, “The Switch,” a series of meandering, hypnotic tracks on which Gordon chants — dolefully and often indecipherably — over dissonant guitars. The mood is much darker than “Coming Apart,” the band’s 2013 debut, a sign of the times. “There’s this blanket of heaviness,” Gordon says of Trump’s America. “Bill used to joke: This is what it feels like to be alive today.” She pauses. “That would be a good title.” Their chosen title references electricity, and the effects pedals they stomp on and off. But there’s another meaning too: “when you think you’re going to go one way, and you go another,” Gordon offers. "
783,"The federal government on Thursday mounted a new effort to unravel AT&T’s deal with Time Warner, a blockbuster merger that has already started to reshape the media industry. The deal was finalized a month ago, after a federal judge rejected the government’s argument that the $85.4 billion agreement would harm competition and consumers. The combination of the two companies has created a media and telecommunications giant with television stations, a movie studio, nearly 160 million wireless customers and a nationwide satellite television service, DirecTV. An AT&T executive is already in charge of Time Warner properties like HBO and the news network CNN. The judge’s decision had almost immediately set off a round of intense deal talks among many of the biggest names in the industry, including Comcast and 21st Century Fox. Many media executives, including those at AT&T and Time Warner, say mergers among their companies are necessary to better compete against tech giants like Netflix and Amazon. The Department of Justice filed its notice of appeal on the same day that Netflix beat out HBO for the most Emmy nominations — ending the premium channel’s 17-year run as the most-nominated outlet. The Justice Department declined to comment. But experts say the appeal sends a clear signal that the government, despite its court loss, will be aggressive on deals between companies with complementary businesses, known as vertical mergers. Immediately after the AT&T-Time Warner merger was approved last month, Comcast entered a bidding war with the Walt Disney Company for the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox. "
784,"— Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, in a radio interview on Tuesday — Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, in remarks on the Senate floor on Tuesday — Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, in a news conference on Wednesday Judge Kavanaugh has written two dissenting opinions in the legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act while serving on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In both cases, he refrained from making broad pronouncements about the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, said Wendy Parmet, a professor of health law at Northeastern University. She characterized one dissent as “very boring, technical, very arcane” and the other as “very technical, lawyerly and boring.” Nicholas Bagley, a professor of health law and administrative law at the University of Michigan, disagreed with the Democrats’ framing of Judge Kavanaugh’s writings. He said Judge Kavanaugh “doesn’t think of these cases as Affordable Care Act cases” but instead focused on specific legal issues. Seven-Sky v. Holder In 2011, Judge Kavanaugh’s appeals court upheld the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate that compelled most Americans who do not have health insurance to pay a penalty. (The tax law signed by President Trump in December repealed the mandate, effective in 2019.) "
785,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Protests in Britain, a no-show in North Korea and the world’s oldest tools. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump arrived in Britain after two days of haphazard deal making with NATO allies and throwing some of America’s closest diplomatic relationships into disarray. Here’s the latest from his European trip. We examined the tight smiles, stiff handshakes and averted gazes that told the story of the NATO meeting. Mr. Trump left on a surprisingly conciliatory note, saying that the U.S. commitment to NATO “remains very strong” and that the allies had agreed to increase levels of military spending “like they never have before.” (That claim was nearly immediately undercut by European leaders.) In Britain, anti-Trump demonstrations are planned for every stage of his visit. Supporters of Mr. Trump are hoping to stage their own “Welcome Trump” procession on Saturday. _____ "
786,"Employees at Deloitte are calling for the firm to end its consulting for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, circulating a petition saying they have “moral objections” to the work. Their bid comes on the heels of a decision by a competitor, McKinsey & Company, to sever ties with the immigration agency after employees raised questions about the work. Deloitte employees have appealed to the company’s chief executive, Cathy Engelbert, to end the company’s contracts with both ICE and United States Customs and Border Protection, and to take a public stance against the Trump administration policy that resulted in migrant children being separated from their parents, according to the petition and screenshots of internal emails seen by The New York Times. Deloitte said its work had played no role in the separation of migrant families. The stands taken by Deloitte and McKinsey workers underscore the rise of employee activism as a potent voice of protest against Trump administration policies. Last month Google, responding to employee anger over the company’s work with the Pentagon on artificial intelligence, issued new rules barring the company from using A.I. technology for weapons or for surveillance that violates human rights. The petition, along with an employee email to Ms. Engelbert on Tuesday, pointed to a Times article reporting that McKinsey, a rival consultancy, had ended its work with ICE. That article, citing federal contracting records, said that Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers Public Sector L.L.P. and Booz Allen Hamilton also did work with the agency. As of Thursday afternoon, more than 750 names had been added to the petition, records show. “We believe that Deloitte must take a stand against the mistreatment of human beings as a result of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agencies’ continued family separation,” Deloitte employees wrote to Ms. Engelbert. The email also stated that Deloitte “must question how its services and offerings to these agencies contribute to ongoing injustice.” "
787,"WASHINGTON — Mock-shooting drills. Metal detectors. Bulletproof classroom shelters. As deadly school shootings continue to be a fixture in headlines and an everyday fear for districts and students, schools across the country have resorted to “hardening” their campuses. But a federal report released Thursday backs another model that school safety experts have for years supported as a way to save lives: the formation of “threat assessment teams” that employ mental health, law enforcement and education professionals to help identify and support troubled youths. The report, an eight-step guide prepared by the Secret Service’s National Threat Assessment Center, is one of the most explicit pieces of literature to come out of the Trump administration on how to prevent targeted attacks. It stems from decades of research showing that in a majority of school attacks, students knew of the perpetrators’ plans or had concerns about their behavior, said the center’s chief, Lina Alathari. The guide encourages schools to not only build out reporting mechanisms like an online tip form, a dedicated hotline or even a smartphone app, but also promote a positive campus climate so students can share concerns “without feeling ashamed or facing the stigma of being labeled a ‘snitch.’” There is no one-size-fits-all descriptor for a student attacker, Dr. Alathari said, but there are certain things schools can be on alert for. When a student sees a disturbing post on social media by a classmate, for example, or a teacher sees a student suddenly withdrawing from schoolwork, those behaviors can be reported to a threat assessment team. If it is a transient threat, something said out of anger without the weapons to act on it, it can be handled with informal counseling or light disciplinary action, such as a notice to parents, said Amanda Nickerson, the director of the Alberti Center for Bullying Abuse Prevention at the University at Buffalo. "
788,"In the year and a half since Barack Obama left office, dozens of books have been written about his administration, including memoirs by his official photographer, stenographer, speechwriter, communications director, his foreign policy advisers and his director of national intelligence, not to mention the Obamas’ own forthcoming memoirs. But only one book includes a scene where Obama bursts into a motorcycle gang clubhouse in Delaware, casually toting a sawed-off shotgun, to rescue Joe Biden from a mob of angry, heavily armed bikers. “Looks like you all know who my pal is,” Biden tells his antagonists with satisfaction. “He’s the guy who killed Bin Laden,” one of the stunned bikers says. The unlikely scenario sprung from the twisted mind of Andrew Shaffer, author of “Hope Never Dies,” a new mystery novel starring the 44th president and his vice president as a pair of crime-busting amateur sleuths. It’s the first in a planned crime series, with Obama playing a cerebral, detached, analytical Holmes to Biden’s bumbling, impulsive Watson. The novel, out this week, is a roughly 300-page work of political fanfiction, an escapist fantasy that will likely appeal to liberals pining for the previous administration, longing for the Obama-Biden team to emerge from political retirement as action heroes. But it’s also at times a surprisingly earnest story about estranged friends who are reunited under strange circumstances. "
789,"DETROIT — China’s flag flies high above Henniges Automotive, alongside those of Germany, Mexico, Canada and other nations, reflecting the global nature of Michigan’s auto industry and, increasingly, its reliance on Beijing. Henniges, which produces sealing products for cars, was bought in 2015 by the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, a state-owned company that has snapped up other investments in the Detroit area, including the automotive supplier Nexteer, which sits just across Interstate 75 from Henniges. Over the past several years, Beijing has steadily pumped billions of dollars’ worth of investment into Michigan, buying crumbling factories, building new ones and supporting more than 10,000 jobs in the state. But where Michigan sees an economic partner, President Trump sees an “economic enemy” — one intent on overtaking America’s competitive edge by stealing technology, trade secrets and jobs from domestic companies. As Mr. Trump tries to punish China with tariffs and other restrictions, Michigan is caught in the cross hairs, with its ability to remain competitive and develop emerging technologies like autonomous vehicles, robotics and artificial intelligence highly dependent on ties to international markets, including China. “The automotive industry is a global industry,” said Michael O’Kronley, a top executive at A123 Systems, an electric vehicle battery maker purchased out of bankruptcy by the Chinese company Wanxiang in 2013. “If you’re going to supply products into that, you need to be global.” General Motors now sells many more cars in China than it does in the United States, and the largest exporter of cars from the United States by value is not an American brand, but BMW. By some calculations, the car with the highest proportion of United States and Canadian-made content is the Honda Odyssey — and even that includes roughly a quarter of foreign-made parts. Companies — and their workers — say they recognize there are certain risks from sharing their technological secrets with Chinese competitors, but they say it is no longer a choice whether Michigan, the automotive capital of North America, should engage with China, the world’s largest auto market. “You can’t separate the two,” Jerry Xu, former president of the Detroit Chinese Business Association, said of China and Michigan. “You’re going to kill the industry if you try.” "
790,"A Border Patrol agent who obtained the confidential travel records of a Washington journalist and used them to press her about her sources last year is under investigation for misuse of government computer systems, according to an official briefed on the inquiry. The agent, Jeffrey A. Rambo, who usually worked in the San Diego area, was temporarily assigned at the time to the National Targeting Center, a facility in Sterling, Va., operated by Customs and Border Protection that stores data on the travel of millions of Americans and foreigners. Such information is supposed to be used only under strict rules by immigration and law enforcement officials. Now the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general and investigators from the border agency are examining whether Mr. Rambo used the travel data improperly or illegally and whether anyone else was involved. Press advocates have expressed alarm that a government official would use sensitive private information in what they say amounted to a blackmail attempt against a journalist. On June 1, 2017, Mr. Rambo, 33, contacted Ali Watkins, a reporter for Politico at the time who now works at The New York Times, saying that he needed to meet her in Washington immediately. He told Ms. Watkins that he worked for the government but declined to give his name or agency. In a lengthy conversation at a bar near Dupont Circle, Mr. Rambo claimed to be helping the F.B.I. with investigations into leaks of sensitive material to journalists. He eventually revealed that he knew the details of a trip to Spain that Ms. Watkins had taken with James A. Wolfe, security director of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who was then her boyfriend. According to accounts Ms. Watkins provided to friends and editors, Mr. Rambo hinted that he might disclose their relationship to The Washington Post and pressed her to become his informant and report to him on other journalists and their sources. "
791,"To the Editor: Re “Subpoena May Put Theory to the Test” (front page, July 11): Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s law review article arguing that presidents should not have to respond to civil and criminal lawsuits while in office is based upon the premise that a president takes the responsibilities of the office seriously and devotes many hours to studying the issues and developing policies in the national interest. President Trump does none of those things. He goes to summit meetings poorly prepared, he relies on his gut instincts, he is easily bored in meetings on important issues and he plays an extraordinary amount of golf. He certainly has time to respond to a subpoena. ROBERT R. WATSON, DEER ISLE, ME. To the Editor: Judge Brett Kavanaugh has written that a president should not be subjected to legal proceedings while in office because defending himself would prevent him from doing the critical job he was elected to do. Instead, charges would need to await the end of his term (impeachment would remain an option, but a highly unlikely one with this Republican Congress). But suppose the charge is conflict of interest and the allegations are that his policy decisions are intended to enrich himself and his family. Or, alternatively, suppose that his choices on international matters reflect the possibility that a foreign adversary has leverage over him because, for example, he owes large sums of money to either that government or individuals who are tied closely to it. Assume, first, that an investigation leading to charges would be started only if there were fact-based reasons to do so, and, second, that it would proceed to the point of seeking testimony from the president only if the results of the investigation warranted it. Does Judge Kavanaugh really mean we should endure the potential damage that president could do to America’s interests at home or abroad instead of pursuing a legal process that would determine the president’s actual guilt or innocence? "
792,"WASHINGTON — The administration’s trade fight with China may soon be fought in the aisles of Walmart, Best Buy, REI and Costco. President Trump’s latest round of proposed tariffs on Chinese goods would finally pull American consumers into an escalating trade war that they have, thus far, mostly watched from a distance. Administration officials took pains in their first batch of Chinese tariffs to largely shield consumers from seeing immediate price increases on products they buy. The $34 billion round imposed on July 6 focused largely on goods that businesses purchase, which do not typically appear on store shelves, such as aircraft parts and industrial machinery. But the list of $200 billion worth of products administration officials proposed hitting with tariffs on Tuesday would push up prices at many American retailers. The tariffs would be lower than the previous round — 10 percent instead of 25 percent — and they still mostly avoid apparel, one of the most visible product lines that Americans buy heavily from China. But they include electronics, food, tools, housewares and a wide range of other consumer goods. The tariffs would not go into effect for several months and may not happen at all if the United States and China are able to resolve their differences. Economists say that expansion will drive inflation higher and erode Americans’ purchasing power, potentially hurting economic growth. Inflation is already rising, the Labor Department reported on Thursday, driven largely by energy prices. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.9 percent in June from a year ago, its highest rate of the last six years. The rate is lower — 2.3 percent — for core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices. Home furnishing prices have barely risen at all over the last year, and prices for information technology hardware and services have fallen by 2.3 percent in that time. "
793,"Will Democratic gains in the November midterm elections be squandered by an inopportune bout of party infighting? The upset by the first-time candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over the 10-term incumbent and House Democratic Caucus chairman Joseph Crowley in New York’s 14th Congressional District primary has reinvigorated this debate. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and an alumna of Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign, ran on an ambitious left-wing platform while attacking “establishment incumbents” and “the institutional Democratic Party” for their supposed ideological timidity. Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, appeared to minimize Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s victory by describing it as “just one district”; some political analysts warned that the popularity of such appeals in the blue precincts of Queens and the Bronx is unlikely to be equaled in the places elsewhere in the country where federal elections are usually decided. Top Democratic officials — and their sympathizers in the pundit class — are evidently concerned that the surge in liberal activism provoked by the Trump presidency may pose a threat to the party’s fortunes in 2018 by exacerbating what a recent Times article described as “a moment of extraordinary conflict” and “turmoil on the left.” But they needn’t worry too much: American history demonstrates that party unity is not a necessary condition for electoral success. Democrats repeatedly won presidential and congressional elections by landslide margins in the decades between the 1930s and 1960s even as the national party was deeply split between Northern and Southern wings that  disagreed on issues ranging from civil rights to the Vietnam War — much more fundamental rifts than any current divide within the party. More recently, the growth of the Tea Party movement during the presidency of Barack Obama produced notably sharp fractures among Republicans that ended the careers of several leading politicians, but it did not prevent Republican candidates from netting 70 House seats and 14 Senate seats between 2010 and 2014. Political commentators often suggest that national parties maximize their electoral effectiveness when they push a single policy program or message. But the Democratic Party is organized as a coalition of social groups and best served when candidates are free to shape individual campaign appeals tailored to the interests of their own constituencies. Rather than acting as a single party “base” with a common set of policy goals or ideological commitments, Democratic supporters are made up of a diverse array of social groups strewn across state and district boundaries, each with its own agenda of political concerns and quest for representation among the party leadership. Mobilizing the collective Democratic faithful from coast to coast therefore requires a variety of distinct campaign messages — and messengers. "
794,"DENVER — When President Trump pardoned two cattlemen from the high desert of Oregon this week, both convicted of setting fires on federal land, even their lawyer was mystified as to how the case got the attention of the White House. “I don’t know the machinations of how it happened,” said Lawrence Matasar, a Portland lawyer who has represented the ranchers — Dwight L. Hammond, and his son, Steven D. Hammond. “This was not the standard process.” Mr. Matasar, it seems, was unaware of the exact reach of Forrest Lucas, an Indiana oil products tycoon and friend of Vice President Mike Pence. Mr. Lucas, a self-made multimillionaire with a sprawling empire that includes a ranch, an oil products company, several motor sports series, a television network, a film-production company and a well-funded activist and lobbying group with an anti-regulation, pro-rancher bent, has known the vice president for years. With his wife, Mr. Lucas has donated more than $100,000 to Mr. Pence’s campaigns. Among other encounters, Mr. Pence recently joined him in a lavish suite at the home of the Indianapolis Colts football team: Lucas Oil Stadium. (Mr. Lucas, who likes to affix his name to most of his enterprises, has a $121.5 million deal to place his brand at the Colts’ front door). The two had discussed a range of issues over the years, so when Mr. Lucas mentioned the Hammonds, Mr. Pence listened. "
795,"Congressional Republicans are playing a dangerous game in their rush to defend Jim Jordan, the Ohio congressman facing accusations that, as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University, he ignored athletes’ complaints of sexual abuse by the team doctor. By attacking Mr. Jordan’s accusers, dismissing the accusers as politically motivated and spinning deep-state conspiracy theories — even as the accusations pile up and Mr. Jordan’s denials grow more dubious — lawmakers are opting for tribal loyalty over concern for the public good. While this kind of blind partisanship may feel like a necessity to Republicans in the age of Donald Trump, it has real potential to come back and bite them on their backsides. Also, it’s morally wrong. The initial allegations against Mr. Jordan surfaced on July 3. At last count, eight former wrestlers had come forward insisting that Mr. Jordan knew of the serial predation by Dr. Richard Strauss, who committed suicide in 2005. Among Mr. Jordan’s early defenders was President Trump. “I don’t believe them,” he said a couple of days into the uproar. “No question in my mind. I believe Jim Jordan 100 percent. He’s an outstanding man.” Congressional Republicans have followed the same script, rejecting the very idea that someone of Mr. Jordan’s character would turn a blind eye to abuse. On Tuesday, the conservative House Freedom Caucus voted to officially support Mr. Jordan, its former chairman. The caucus’s current chairman, Mark Meadows of North Carolina, has praised his colleague as “a man of the utmost character, honor, and integrity.” Representative Steve Scalise, the conference’s chief whip, declared, “I have always known Jim Jordan to be honest, and I’m confident he would stand up for his athletes, just like he’s always stood up for what’s right.” Speaker Paul Ryan too has vouched for Mr. Jordan’s “honesty” and “integrity.” Indeed, the cascade of references to Mr. Jordan’s “honesty” and “integrity” has achieved a Manchurian Candidate-like ubiquity. If Mr. Jordan was a Democrat, does anyone doubt all these men would be singing a different tune? "
796,"To the Editor: Re “Merkel Replies to U.S. Attacks With Caution” (front page, July 12): President Trump accuses Germany of being in the grip of Russia? By now it’s pretty clear that when Mr. Trump attacks someone, it’s frequently about something he is guilty of himself. This may be a childish ploy, but it’s appallingly successful among adults who have become accustomed to civility. It’s horrifying to sit helplessly on the sidelines and watch his playground bully tactics work not only with leaders of other countries, but also with our own Congress and with his cabinet. Will no one challenge him? What is everyone so afraid of? It’s a scenario worthy of a Stephen King horror story. TERRY SHAMES, BERKELEY, CALIF.

797,"LONDON — President Trump said Thursday that he was making “great progress” in denuclearization talks with North Korea, citing what he called a “very nice note” he received last week from Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, though it made no mention of nuclear weapons. In a letter that Mr. Trump posted on Twitter along with an English translation, Mr. Kim called his summit meeting with the president in Singapore last month “the start of a meaningful journey,” and raised the idea of another such encounter. “I extend my conviction that the epochal progress in promoting the DPRK-U.S. relations will bring our next meeting forward,” he wrote, using the initials for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, North Korea’s official name. The tone of the letter was starkly at odds with that of North Korean officials last week in the wake of a visit to Pyongyang, the North’s capital, by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Pompeo has toiled, so far unsuccessfully, to negotiate details of the agreement in principle struck by Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons. After his visit, the North said Mr. Pompeo had engaged in “gangster-like” tactics and made unilateral demands. "
798,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. • Pushback. America’s traditional allies, joined by some of its rivals, are accelerating their efforts to buttress a global system that President Trump has seemed prepared to tear down. The E.U., China, Japan and others are making new partnerships, trade deals and joint statements, efforts that seem intended to preserve the rules-based order the United States created after World War II and championed ever since. In the U.S., President Trump added to days of confusion, appearing to shift away from his acceptance of U.S. intelligence warnings on Russia, only to be gainsayed by his press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The uproar has been a test case for Mr. Trump’s supporters. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump continues to move on issues that captivate his base, taking monumental steps to shrink the U.S. asylum system and discourage people from applying. _____ "
799,"The Justice Department has been doling out nearly $200 million in public safety grants to selected cities across the country in the last few weeks. But the awards came with new strings attached: The cities had to agree to cooperate with immigration authorities. For so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions like New York City and New York State — which generally do not hold people arrested on criminal charges in jails for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE, to deport them — the federal government’s additional conditions were seen as illegal and coercive. So city and state officials separately sued the Justice Department on Wednesday, filing in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The public safety grants were originally supposed to be distributed in 2017, which included an $8.8 million grant for New York and $4.1 million for New York City. In a letter in late June, the state had been told it could receive the money if it met the new conditions; the city still has not heard whether it will get the funds. Attorney General Barbara D. Underwood of New York led a lawsuit with five other similarly affected states — New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington. Together, they stand to lose $25 million. “This is a political attack on New Yorkers, at the expense of our public safety — and it is unlawful,” Ms. Underwood said in a statement. “So we will see the Trump administration in court.” "
800,"SAKRAN, Turkey — A Turkish court on Wednesday ordered an American pastor accused of espionage to remain incarcerated, ignoring pleas for his release from his lawyer and the United States government. In a sign that tensions between Turkey and the United States have not eased, the court ordered the pastor, Andrew Brunson, to stay in jail until his next hearing, in October. By then, he will have been detained for two years. Mr. Brunson, who has done missionary work in Turkey for the past 23 years, is on trial on charges of terrorism and espionage — one of 20 American citizens who have been prosecuted under a government crackdown since a failed coup in 2016. The White House and members of Congress have raised Mr. Brunson’s case personally with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, including most recently in a phone call by President Trump. American officials had hoped the pastor’s release would signal an improvement in the fraught relations between the countries. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke with Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu of Turkey in a phone call immediately after the proceedings ended Wednesday in a court in Sakran, near the western city of Izmir. “We are disappointed in the results of today’s hearing,” Philip Kosnett, chargé d’affaires and head of mission at the United States Embassy in Turkey, said outside court after the hearing. “I have read the indictment, attended three hearings. I don’t believe that there is any indication that Pastor Brunson is guilty of any sort of criminal or terrorist activity.” "
801,"We can’t be sure what the substitution of Judge Brett Kavanaugh for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy means for the Supreme Court’s abortion jurisprudence. But we can take a page from history to make an educated guess. Two pages, actually. Let’s set two judicial opinions on the subject of abortion side by side to see what they tell us. One, less than a year old, is by the current Supreme Court nominee. The other was written by another appeals court judge, Samuel A. Alito Jr., 15 years before he became a Supreme Court justice. The Kavanaugh opinion may suggest what lies ahead if he is confirmed. Justice Alito’s opinion told us in no uncertain words. I’ll begin there, because no one should have been surprised by what happened after Justice Alito replaced Justice Sandra Day O’Connor in 2006. Justice O’Connor had voted with the 5-to-4 majority in 2000 to declare unconstitutional Nebraska’s criminal prohibition on so-called “partial-birth abortion,” a second-trimester abortion procedure that, while rarely used in practice, proved an invaluable gift to anti-abortion politicians. Seven years later, the court flipped, voting 5 to 4 to uphold a nearly identical law, this one passed by Congress, with Justice Alito in the majority. What happened? The court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg observed in her acerbic dissent in the new case, Gonzales v. Carhart, was now “differently composed.” Then, two years ago, Justice Alito dissented from the court’s decision in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, which declared unconstitutional a Texas law that would have imposed needless requirements on abortion clinics and would have caused many clinics in the state to close. Justice Alito objected that predictions of the devastating effect the law would have on the availability of abortion in Texas were based on “crude inferences.” The vote in that case was 5 to 3, with Justice Kennedy in the majority. Back in 1991, as a judge on the Philadelphia-based United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Sam Alito had proven his anti-abortion bona fides with a separate opinion in a case that reviewed Pennsylvania’s sweeping Abortion Control Act. The three-judge panel on which he sat upheld all the law’s many provisions, including a waiting period and mandatory counseling, with a single exception: the requirement that a married woman notify her husband of her intention to terminate her pregnancy. Doctors could lose their licenses for performing an abortion on a married woman without first obtaining her signature attesting that she had complied with the notice requirement. Judge Walter Stapleton’s majority opinion, taking account of what he called “the real-world consequences of forced notification,” declared that provision unconstitutional. Most married women do discuss an abortion decision with their husbands, Judge Stapleton observed; for them, “a notification requirement is unnecessary and serves no state interest.” But he added that “the number of different situations in which women may reasonably fear dire consequences from notifying their husbands is potentially limitless.” The “relevant burdens to be assessed,” he concluded, were not the burdens on married women in general, but specifically “on women who would choose not to notify their husbands in the absence of state compulsion to do so.” Because the burden on this group of women outweighed any interest that the state had in requiring notification, the provision was unconstitutional. "
802,"BRUSSELS — From trade to regulation to security, America’s traditional allies are accelerating their efforts to buttress a global system that President Trump has seemed prepared to tear down. After months of stunned indecision, they have undertaken a flurry of efforts intended to preserve the rules-based order the United States created after World War II and championed ever since. The most obvious example came on Monday, the same day a stunned world watched Mr. Trump praise President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a competitor after having dismissed Europe as an economic “foe.” A few thousand miles away, in Beijing, the leaders of the European Union and China held a long-scheduled meeting of their own. In the past, expectations for such meetings were low, given the conflicts on trade and human rights between the Europeans and the Chinese. But while those differences remain, this summit meeting produced an unusual joint declaration and a common commitment to keep the global system strong. The next day, the Europeans traveled to Japan and signed the biggest free-trade agreement in history, just the sort of deal the Trump administration has criticized. And on Wednesday, Europe’s top regulator announced a $5.1 billion fine against Google, another strong indication that Brussels is not just fighting to maintain the rules-based trading order, but is also positioning itself as the watchdog of that system. "
803,"— Mr. Kudlow, in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday Mr. Kudlow was seeking to justify Mr. Trump’s trade dispute with China and the European Union with a dramatic — but overstated  — comparison of tariffs that each impose. Even among major economies, the United States does not have the lowest tariffs in the world, though they are among the lowest. The president’s 2018 economic report compared the average tariffs that six high-income countries, eight emerging economies and the European Union imposed on most-favored nations in 2016. According to the report, the United States charged most-favored nations an average tariff of 2.4 percent on manufacturing products — which is similar to the 2.5 percent Mr. Kudlow cited. But Australia’s and Japan’s tariffs were even lower, at 1.3 percent and 1.2 percent. Tariffs on all products imposed by the United States against most-favored nations ranked second lowest, at 3.5 percent. Again, Australia’s were lower, at 2.5 percent. (These figures do not take into account countervailing or anti-dumping duties — tariffs that countries impose on what they deem unfair trade.) These numbers are consistent with a report from the World Trade Organization covering 2016. And the World Bank’s estimates for average tariffs on most-favored nations are similar: the United States at 2.8 percent and Australia at 2.7 percent in 2016, the most recent data available. "
804,"Even before the Supreme Court struck down mandatory union fees for government workers last month, the next phase of the conservative legal campaign against public-sector unions was underway. In March, with the decision looming, lawyers representing government workers in Washington State asked a federal court to order one of the state’s largest public-employee unions “to disgorge and refund” fees that nonmembers had already paid. Similar lawsuits were filed in California, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and Ohio. The complaints could upend the legal system by arguing that states and private parties like unions face liability even though they followed the law as it existed at the time. They could also cost unions hundreds of millions of dollars. Beyond their legal claims, the cases share another striking detail: The lead counsel in each is a conservative lawyer named Jonathan F. Mitchell. Mr. Mitchell, 41, has a formidable résumé. He was a Supreme Court clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia; worked at the Justice Department under President George W. Bush; taught at several law schools, including Stanford; and spent more than four years as the solicitor general of Texas. After the 2016 election, he served as a volunteer attorney on the Trump transition team, where he helped review future executive orders. In September, the president nominated him to head the Administrative Conference of the United States, a small federal agency that advises the government on improving its inner workings. His nomination awaits action by the Senate after the Judiciary Committee approved him on a party-line vote in March. "
805,"President Trump threw his political clout behind a hard-line candidate in the contested primary for governor of Georgia on Wednesday, backing Brian Kemp, a state official who has run television ads showing him wielding a shotgun and vowing to “round up” illegal immigrants. Mr. Trump’s support could well decide a close nomination fight between Mr. Kemp and Casey Cagle, Georgia’s Republican lieutenant governor. The two men are competing in a July 24 runoff election after neither managed to win a majority in the first round of voting in May. The eventual Republican nominee will compete in the general election in November against Stacey Abrams, a former Democratic leader in the Georgia House of Representatives who is vying to become the first black woman to serve as governor of a state. A contest between Mr. Kemp, Georgia’s secretary of state, and Ms. Abrams would likely be one of the most hotly contested in the country, and it could represent an important cultural test for a traditionally conservative state that has grown more diverse and cosmopolitan in recent years. Mr. Trump won Georgia in 2016 by a clear, but not overwhelming, margin, and Democrats believe it could be a swing state in 2020. [Here’s what’s coming up next on the primary calendar.] In this year’s Republican primary, however, Mr. Trump’s endorsement is perhaps the most valuable seal of approval a candidate could obtain — and he offered it emphatically to Mr. Kemp. “Brian is tough on crime, strong on the border and illegal immigration,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Wednesday afternoon. “He loves our Military and our Vets and protects our Second Amendment. I give him my full and total endorsement.” "
806,"WASHINGTON — In a sign that Representative Jim Jordan is unlikely to shake a sexual misconduct scandal anytime soon, five former wrestlers sued Ohio State University this week, accusing university officials of knowing that a team doctor was abusing student athletes and doing nothing to stop him. One of the lawsuits specifically mentions Mr. Jordan, Republican of Ohio, who served as the wrestling team’s assistant coach in the late 1980s and early 1990s, citing news reports that wrestlers had informed him of the abuse. Lawyers pursuing both cases say they expect to call the influential conservative as a witness. Mr. Jordan has vehemently denied allegations that he ignored sexual misconduct, and so far he has maintained the backing of his party’s heavyweights, including President Trump, Speaker Paul D. Ryan, and Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the Republican whip. But the decision by the former athletes to sue the university means that more twists could come. “Anyone who would have been in the chain of command” or an authority figure in the university’s athletic program is “certainly someone we’ll be interested in deposing,” said Joseph Sauder, a lawyer representing one of the former wrestlers. Another lawyer, Stephen Estey, who has handled a number of sex abuse class-action lawsuits, said that his focus was more on the university and its failure to protect its students and less on Mr. Jordan. Still, he said, in the discovery and deposition process, “we’ll find out who knew what.” A spokesman for Ohio State said in a statement that the university “remains actively committed to uncovering what may have happened and what university leaders at the time may have known,” and that officials “are deeply concerned for everyone who may have been affected” by the actions of the team doctor several decades ago.

807,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump reversed course on Russia again, saying the country is no longer targeting the U.S. The remarks contradict the U.S. intelligence chief and come a day after Mr. Trump promised the government was working to guard against possible Russian interference in the coming midterm elections. Earlier, Mr. Trump tweeted that “many people at the higher ends of intelligence” loved his remarks on Monday regarding Russia’s possible meddling. It was not immediately clear whether the president was referring to smart people or high-level intelligence officials. He also implied that “haters” were angry that he got along with the leader of Russia and “would rather go to war.” "
808,"It was a subtle exchange, about 20 minutes into yet another clamorous White House press briefing, and a casual viewer of Wednesday’s proceedings would be forgiven for missing it. But an unusual show of solidarity between rival journalists seemed to signal a new approach by the White House press corps toward an administration that regularly uses briefings to deride, and divide, the news media. Hallie Jackson, a correspondent for NBC News, was grilling the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, about President Trump’s credibility, given his attempts at damage control after a Helsinki summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Ms. Sanders, eager to move on, invoked a tried-and-true spin doctor tactic: Next question, please. “I’m going to keep moving,” she said, interrupting Ms. Jackson and turning to Jordan Fabian of The Hill. “Jordan, go ahead.” Undeterred, Ms. Jackson said she had a follow-up question. “Sorry, you’ve asked two,” Ms. Sanders said, speaking over her. “I’m going to move on to Jordan.” A brief silence fell over the room, before Mr. Fabian spoke up. “Hallie,” he said, “go ahead if you want.” "
809,"Representative John Faso must think very little of his constituents in New York’s 19th Congressional District in the Hudson Valley and the Catskill Mountains. He’s counting on them to be bigots. How else can we explain Mr. Faso’s contention that his Democratic challenger, Antonio Delgado, is unfit for office because he had a career as a rapper a decade ago? “Mr. Delgado’s lyrics are offensive, troubling and inconsistent with the views of the people of the 19th District and America,” Mr. Faso, a Republican, said in a statement last week. Mr. Faso, who has heartily embraced President Trump’s agenda, is having a hard time. He is fighting to hold on to one of the most vulnerable Republican seats in the country, facing a rising swell of Democratic momentum in a district that voted for Barack Obama twice but went to Donald Trump in 2016. A recent poll, commissioned by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee this month, found Mr. Faso trailing Mr. Delgado by seven percentage points.   Mr. Delgado is a Harvard-educated lawyer and Rhodes scholar who was raised in upstate New York. In 2006, Mr. Delgado, under the stage name AD The Voice, released an album that tackled issues from poverty and inequality to racism and the war in Iraq. It also includes a not infrequent use of the N-word, something Mr. Delgado, who is black, has a right to use. He also released several singles. Mr. Delgado is a strong candidate who has focused on preserving health care coverage, bringing more jobs to the region, protecting the environment and defending a woman’s right to choose. He has made an impressive case for being elected. Mr. Faso, on the other hand, has abandoned any effort to explain how he’d serve constituents, instead hoping that his quisling behavior toward the president and a cynical campaign of race-baiting will be enough. In another example, Mr. Faso came out in favor of stricter standards for food stamp recipients, because, he said, “virtually every drug dealer they arrest has got a food stamp card in his pocket.” He also ran digital ads promising to “keep MS-13 out of New York,” featuring an ominous-looking photo of tattooed Latino men. Mr. Faso seems to feel more comfortable exploiting painful racial divisions than talking about his votes in Congress, like the one last year to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act. That repeal would have  jeopardized health care protections for his own constituents. The congressman might also educate himself about rap, an American art form celebrated by millions of people around the world — and likely a large number of voters in his district. He could start with one of his campaign opponent’s songs, “Draped in Flags,” in which Mr. Delgado said Americans who love their country have a duty to question their government. “It’s what a patriot does in hard times,” Mr. Delgado rapped.  "
810,"Iran rejected eight requests from the United States for a meeting of their presidents at the United Nations General Assembly last year, a top Iranian official said Wednesday. The assertion, if confirmed, suggests a previously undisclosed level of hostility among top Iranian officials toward President Trump, who has called Iran a nuclear threat, regional menace and global sponsor of terrorism. It would also suggest a previously unknown eagerness by the Trump administration for some kind of dialogue. White House and State Department officials did not immediately respond to the Iranian assertion, made by President Hassan Rouhani’s chief of staff, Mahmoud Vaezi, at a cabinet meeting reported in Iran’s state-run news media. “Trump asked the Iranian delegation eight times to have a meeting with the president,” Mr. Vaezi said. Iran’s Foreign Ministry previously said an American request for a Trump-Rouhani meeting on the sidelines of the General Assembly last September had been declined. Some Iranian state media have reported that Mr. Trump even invited Mr. Rouhani for dinner during that period. But the number of times that Mr. Trump’s requests for a meeting were rebuffed had not been reported. "
811,"ATLANTA — Should Maria Palacios, a Mexican-born Georgia resident who moved to the state as a child and became an American citizen in June 2017, be allowed to run for the State House of Representatives? She has been fighting for that right since she was thrown off the ballot in May, first by an administrative law judge, then by the Georgia secretary of state, Brian Kemp. Her legal battle comes against the backdrop of a state whose population is rapidly changing, a governor’s race with illegal immigration as a white-hot issue among conservatives, and a nationwide fear among liberals that their opponents are rigging the system to keep people of color out of the voting booths — and out of office. Ms. Palacios, 28, hit another roadblock in an Atlanta courtroom on Wednesday, when a Superior Court judge agreed with Mr. Kemp that she was ineligible to appear on the November ballot as the Democratic candidate in the 29th District. Mr. Kemp is running for governor, and facing a runoff on July 24 for the Republican nomination. He has attracted national attention — and a boost in his poll numbers — with ads that showed him brandishing a shotgun and boasting that he might use his pickup truck to round up “criminal” illegal immigrants and “take ’em home myself.” In Georgia, Mr. Kemp has infuriated liberals by supporting a voter ID law and by questioning the validity of thousands of voter registrations collected by a group founded by Stacey Abrams, the former minority leader in the State House, who won the Democratic primary for governor. President Trump intervened in the Republican runoff on Wednesday by endorsing Mr. Kemp. After the court hearing on Wednesday, Ms. Palacios’s lawyer, Sean J. Young, the legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union in Georgia, said she would appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court. “The court clearly did not comply with the Constitution of Georgia today,” Mr. Young said. "
812,"LOS ANGELES — The Trump administration, faced with a public outcry over the separation of migrant families at the Southwest border, has said it is exploring a major expansion of family detention centers. But two of the government’s own medical consultants said this week that they had identified a “high risk of harm” to migrant children housed at such facilities. A series of 10 investigations over the past four years, conducted during both the Obama and Trump administrations, “frequently revealed serious compliance issues resulting in harm to children,” the two physicians, Scott Allen and Pamela McPherson, said in a letter to the Senate’s Whistleblower Protection Caucus. The doctors said they had “watched in horror” as migrant children were separated from their families over the past several months in a bid to deter illegal border crossers. But they cautioned that the Trump administration’s fallback position may not be much better. “The likely alternative — detention of children with a parent — also poses high risk of harm to children and their families,” said the doctors, who currently serve as “subject-matter experts” for the Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. “In our professional opinion, there is no amount of programming that can ameliorate the harms created by the very act of confining children to detention centers.” The examinations described in their report uncovered problems including a child who lost a third of his body weight and an infant with bleeding of the brain that went undiagnosed for five days. In a separate filing this week with a court in Los Angeles, lawyers who conducted more than 200 interviews with migrant parents and children said they had collected “shocking and atrocious” reports about conditions at various government-run detention centers, especially at the initial processing centers operated by Customs and Border Protection along the Southwest border. "
813,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. President Trump faces pushback, the E.U. fines Google, and the British Open tees off today. Here’s the latest: • America’s allies are pushing back as President Trump keeps up his mission of disruption. Nations in the European Union and elsewhere are accelerating their efforts to buttress a global system that Mr. Trump has seemed prepared to tear down. The world’s leading economies, including Europe, China and Japan, are forging new partnerships and trade deals, efforts intended to preserve the rules-based order that the United States created after World War II. In the U.S., Mr. Trump added to days of confusion, appearing to shift away from his reluctant acceptance of American intelligence agencies’ warnings on Russia, only to be contradicted by his press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Separately, Mr. Trump questioned a core value of NATO: mutual defense. In an interview with Fox News, Mr. Trump wondered why the U.S. should be responsible for defending Montenegro, a NATO member. But mutual defense is a fundamental part of the treaty’s charter: If one NATO country is attacked, every member of the alliance is considered attacked. "
814,"This has been the Trump trip that keeps on giving. There hardly seemed more damage he could do after he declared the European Union a “foe,” insulted Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, railed at NATO, upstaged Queen Elizabeth II and gave that infamous news conference with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Yet then, for good measure, came his weird suggestion that Montenegro’s 640,000 souls are “very aggressive” and could drag NATO into World War III. In the context of an obsequious interview by the Fox News host Tucker Carlson, taped in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday and aired on Tuesday evening, it appeared almost as an aside in President Trump’s standard rants about trade, migrants, Hillary Clinton’s computer servers, the perfidy of the F.B.I. or NATO’s penury. Yet like so many of Mr. Trump’s unscripted comments, it revealed another facet of his ignorance of and disdain for America’s historic place in the world and its alliances, or of the power of a presidential pronouncement.   After drawing Mr. Trump into the usual tirade on how the NATO allies were getting a free ride while ripping off the United States in trade, Mr. Carlson moved to his next prompt: “So, let’s say Montenegro, which joined last year, is attacked. Why should my son go to Montenegro to defend it from attack? Why is that?”   “I understand what you’re saying,” Mr. Trump responded. “I’ve asked the same question.” “Tiny” Montenegro, he continued, has “very aggressive people. They may get aggressive and congratulations, you’re in World War III.” He then segued to a claim that he had already “raised” an additional $44 billion from NATO members and there was more to come, followed by a riff on how immigration was “destroying the culture of Europe.” The answer to Mr. Carlson’s and Mr. Trump’s question on why defend Montenegro from attack is, of course, Article 5 of the NATO treaty, the central tenet that requires every member to come to the aid of any ally under attack. That does not mean NATO would have to pile in if Montenegro aggressively assaulted, say, Serbia, since the article is triggered only if a member is attacked. It has been invoked only once: not in the Balkans, but in support of the United States after 9/11. "
815,"WASHINGTON — Two weeks before his inauguration, Donald J. Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election. The evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin, who had described to the C.I.A. how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation. Mr. Trump sounded grudgingly convinced, according to several people who attended the intelligence briefing. But ever since, Mr. Trump has tried to cloud the very clear findings that he received on Jan. 6, 2017, which his own intelligence leaders have unanimously endorsed. The shifting narrative underscores the degree to which Mr. Trump regularly picks and chooses intelligence to suit his political purposes. That has never been more clear than this week. On Monday, standing next to the Russian president in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump said he accepted Mr. Putin’s denial of Russian election intrusions. By Tuesday, faced with a bipartisan political outcry, Mr. Trump sought to walk back his words and sided with his intelligence agencies. On Wednesday, when a reporter asked, “Is Russia still targeting the U.S.?” Mr. Trump shot back, “No” — directly contradicting statements made only days earlier by his director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who was sitting a few chairs away in the Cabinet Room. (The White House later said he was responding to a different question.) "
816,"President Trump had a simple enough explanation for all those people outraged that when he appeared at a news conference on Monday with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, he seemed to dismiss American intelligence about Russian election meddling. Not so, the president said the next day. The sentence in question, he said, was meant to be “sort of a double negative” — it’s just that he failed to put enough “nots” in it. That probably sent many listeners drifting back to their elementary-school English classrooms, where teachers told them to never use two negatives in the same sentence. The reasoning: a) It was something only uneducated people did, and b) the two negatives canceled each other out. The classic example was that when the Rolling Stones sang, “I can’t get no satisfaction,” they were “actually” saying they got plenty. Nobody really believed that. It was clear from the context what the Stones were saying. But the larger lesson was not lost. So many of us dutifully refrain from using double negatives like “I don’t never go there,” “I don’t like no politicians,” “I can’t hardly wait.” Their unacceptability is such that The New York Times stylebook doesn’t even have an entry on them — the assumption is that nobody would think to use such a nonstandard construction. This animus against double negatives, however, did not always exist. As my Pocket Fowler’s Modern English Usage notes, “They were once a feature of standard English, and are to be found in Chaucer, Shakespeare and other writers up to the 17th century.” The idea was that negatives in a sentence were self-reinforcing, not self-cancelling. But gradually that logic changed — “An arithmetical argument replaced a linguistic one,” Fowler’s says — and by the 18th century, grammar books denounced double negatives, and playwrights depicted lower-class characters as using them. What the president now says he should have said doesn’t really fall in the category of the usual frowned-upon double negative. What he claims he meant to say, “I don’t see any reason why it wouldn’t be” Russia behind the election hacking, isn’t ungrammatical. What he did say, “I don’t see any reason why it would be” Russia, was grammatical, too. It was also front-page news. Unfortunately for his assertions about his intent, Mr. Trump, unlike the Rolling Stones, is betrayed by context. Even as he tried to explain away his original comment and declare that he had accepted his intelligence agencies’ findings of Russian involvement, he couldn’t help adding: “Could be other people also. A lot of people out there.” And then, as The Times reports, he “appeared to say on Wednesday that Russia was no longer targeting the United States, contradicting his own intelligence chief.” The White House later said that wasn’t what he meant, but who can tell at this point? For all we know, the president may have just invented a new grammatical form: the triple negative. "

818,"The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance has opened an investigation into whether the Donald J. Trump Foundation violated state tax laws, a move that could lead to a criminal referral for possible prosecution, according to two state officials familiar with the inquiry. The officials would not say when the investigation started, or what activities it may be scrutinizing. But it seemed likely that the inquiry may cover some of the same issues raised by the New York attorney general, Barbara D. Underwood, in a lawsuit filed against the Trump Foundation last month. The attorney general’s lawsuit accused the foundation of violating campaign finance laws, self-dealing and illegally coordinating with the Trump presidential campaign. It seeks to dissolve the foundation, recover millions of dollars in restitution and temporarily bar President Trump and three of his children from serving in leadership positions at any nonprofit operating in New York. A criminal inquiry could reveal additional information beyond the scope of the lawsuit, such as the president’s tax returns. If the investigation found possible criminal activity, it could then refer its findings to a law enforcement agency, such as the state attorney general’s office or a district attorney. That agency could present the findings to a grand jury, according to the two officials, both senior members of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s office, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect an active investigation. Mr. Trump has admitted using the foundation’s money to contribute to political causes. He was also accused of using its funds to settle business disputes, failing to disburse funds to charities to which he said he had given large amounts of money and claiming credit for donations that had actually come from other groups. Mr. Cuomo, who is facing a vigorous Democratic primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon, has been under pressure to issue a criminal referral to Ms. Underwood, without which she cannot independently initiate a criminal case. "
819,"The United States labor market is closing in on full employment in an economic expansion that just began its 10th year, and yet the real hourly wage for the working class has been essentially flat for two years running. Why is that? Economists ask this question every month when the government reports labor statistics. We repeatedly get solid job growth and lower unemployment, but not much to show for wages. Part of that has to do with inflation, productivity and remaining slack in the labor market. But stagnant wages for factory workers and non-managers in the service sector — together they represent 82 percent of the labor force — is mainly the outcome of a long power struggle that workers are losing. Even at a time of low unemployment, their bargaining power is feeble, the weakest I’ve seen in decades. Hostile institutions — the Trump administration, the courts, the corporate sector — are limiting their avenues for demanding higher pay. Looking at the historical relationship between working-class wages and unemployment, wage growth should be rising about a percentage point faster than it is right now. In June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, wages were growing at a yearly rate of 2.7 percent before inflation. While wages have failed to accelerate, consumer prices have climbed. In 2015, inflation was close to zero. When price growth is zero, a dollar extra in your paycheck means a dollar more real purchasing power. Real hourly pay grew at a healthy pace of about 2 percent that year. But price growth is back to more normal levels now. Over the past year, for example, consumer price inflation was 2.9 percent, just about the same rate as hourly pay. Data released on Tuesday show that real weekly earnings for full-time, middle-wage workers hasn’t grown at all since early 2017. "
820,"It is an unfathomable proposition that the day would ever come when America could rightly question the loyalties of its own president, but that is precisely where we have arrived. Donald Trump’s “Surrender Summit” with President Vladimir Putin of Russia was such a disloyal, traitorous display that it boggles the mind. Russia attacked our election in 2016. Russia. Moscow did it to help get Trump elected. Putin himself admitted that “patriotic” Russian hackers may have meddled in the election. These are not open questions. These are facts. And yet, Trump chose to meet with the man who directed those attacks. He did so one on one behind closed doors, so we have no idea what they discussed, confessed, agreed to or even conspired. At the news conference that followed the meeting, Trump undercut our own intelligence community, instead siding with Putin, saying: “I have President Putin. He just said it’s not Russia. I will say this. I don’t see any reason why it would be.” After which Trump said, “So I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.” "
821,"Sinclair Broadcast Group, the largest local television operator in the United States, tried to placate federal regulators on Wednesday regarding its proposal to buy a rival TV group. But the Federal Communications Commission still voted unanimously to have a judge review aspects of the deal, a potentially ominous sign for the merger. The company, known for amplifying the Trump administration’s talking points in commentary segments that air on numerous local newscasts, is seeking to buy Tribune Media for $3.9 billion. The deal would put Sinclair, based in Maryland, in control of broadcasters reaching seven in 10 households across the country, including in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. To satisfy rules that forbid a single company to own airwaves on such a dominant scale, Sinclair previously proposed selling 23 TV stations after the deal was completed. But several of those stations would still effectively fall within its operational control. The F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, said on Monday that he had “serious concerns” with those planned divestitures. Mr. Pai asked the agency’s four commissioners to hand off its review of the merger to an administrative law judge to determine the legality of Sinclair’s original proposal. The company said in a statement on Wednesday that it would now sell off two of the stations in question, one in Dallas and another in Houston, through an independent trust after the closing of the deal with Tribune. A third station, WGN in Chicago, which Tribune owns, would be sold outright to Sinclair to make who controls the station more transparent. But Sinclair’s amended plans apparently had no effect on the F.C.C.’s decision regarding Mr. Pai’s order, which the agency will release to the public on Thursday. "
822,"The kidnappings and mass killings were a fact of daily life for Francisco Miguel-Francisco, a young man living in Cerro Martín, a small village tucked into the indigenous highlands of Guatemala. He grew up in fear of the warring factions that battled for control of the region and that would kill without hesitation for a transgression as small as sharing food or water across enemy lines. Fed up and desperate, he set out for the United States in 1984 and won asylum. He now lives in Arizona as a legal permanent resident with his daughter, who goes to an American school and speaks unaccented English. Three decades later, his son Miguel, who had been left behind in Guatemala, began his own journey away from a life that had become intolerable. Miguel reached Arizona on May 15, 2018, to a much different reception. He was prosecuted and jailed for crossing the border without papers. His 15-year-old daughter, who had accompanied him, was shuttled to another state, and the family couldn’t find her for more than a month. Miguel is still in immigration detention, and his lawyer said he expects that he will soon be denied asylum and deported. The divergent experiences of father and son, who traveled the same cross-continental route to salvation, say much about the American asylum system, which is transforming under President Trump. Both men fled from lawlessness and violence that, even if they had survived, would have threatened any hope of a stable life in their country. But their experiences were viewed very differently in the United States. While migrants fleeing communist governments in Central America during the Cold War were welcomed in the 1980s, those arriving now do not fit into a larger American geopolitical agenda. Their afflictions — gang violence, domestic brutality and poverty — are neither American national security priorities nor anything that was originally intended to be covered under the laws of asylum. "
823,"Iran has denied as “laughably absurd” a detailed Israeli claim that intelligence agents stole clandestine Iranian documents this past winter that reveal what Israel has called Iran’s extensive past research on nuclear bombs. The Iranian denial, issued by the country’s United Nations mission, was in response to articles in The New York Times and other publications in recent days about the detailed claim by Israel, which considers Iran its most dangerous foreign threat. The Times article, published in Monday’s print editions, and similar accounts in The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, were based on a partial viewing of the documents by journalists from those publications at the invitation of the Israeli government. Israeli officials also provided new details on how they said the documents had been obtained — through a secret raid on a Tehran warehouse on Jan. 31 by agents of the Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency, equipped with blowtorches. The trove included what the Israelis described as 50,000 pages and 163 compact discs of memos, videos and plans for building weapons. There was nothing in Israel’s claim that suggested the Iranians were still engaged in such activity, which American intelligence reports have said ended in 2003. But the documents suggested not only that Iran had been deceitful but also that its work in weaponizing nuclear power had been far more sophisticated and organized than initially suspected. The authenticity of the documents, which purport to be at least 15 years old, has not been independently confirmed. Iran has always denied accusations by Israel and others that Iranian nuclear work was meant for military purposes, a denial that Iran’s United Nations mission reiterated in response to Israel’s latest claim. “Iran has always been clear that creating indiscriminate weapons of mass destruction is against what we stand for as a country, and the notion that Iran would abandon any kind of sensitive information in some random warehouse in Tehran is laughably absurd,” a spokesman for the Iranian mission, Alireza Miryousefi, said in an emailed statement. “It’s almost as if they are trying to see what outlandish claims they can get a Western audience to believe.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel first announced the results of the seizure in April after he had given President Trump a private briefing. Just days later, Mr. Trump made good on his longstanding vow to renounce the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran that was negotiated by the Obama administration and the governments of five other major powers, including major European allies of the United States. "
824,"This file was updated on July 24 with Brian Kemp’s victory in Georgia. For Republicans running in competitive primaries this year, one question has loomed above all others: To embrace President Trump, or to oppose him? This choice can make or break a campaign. Already, repeatedly, it has. For pro-Trump insurgents, the scorecard is full of upsets — and for anti-Trump incumbents, startling defeats. That pattern continued on Tuesday, when Georgia’s secretary of state, Brian Kemp, rode a last-minute endorsement from Mr. Trump to win a Republican primary runoff for governor after placing a distant second in the initial vote in May. Mr. Kemp and his opponent, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, had been jockeying for the title of Most Trumpian, and while many factors came into play in Tuesday’s vote, the president gave Mr. Kemp an invaluable gift by issuing a ruling in that fight. Here is a look at how other Republicans have fared after distancing themselves from Mr. Trump or aligning themselves with him. "

Jimmy Kimmel held President Trump’s feet to the fire on Tuesday after the president backed away from his comments in Helsinki, Finland, the day before on who had meddled in the 2016 election. Trump asserted that when he said, “I don’t see any reason why it would be” Russia, he had actually meant to say “wouldn’t.” But Kimmel refused to accept the flip-flop. “The news today is that our president is a liar,” he said. “And not even a good one.” In disavowing his Monday remarks, Trump still refused to lay the blame for interference in the 2016 election squarely at Russia’s feet. “I accept our intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election took place,” he said, then added: “It could be other people also. There’s a lot of people out there.” Stephen Colbert cried foul. "
826,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • It was, according to President Trump, a “would” that should have been a “wouldn’t.” Facing a barrage of criticism from both parties over his comments during a news conference with President Vladimir Putin, Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that he had misspoken about whether Russia had tried to influence the 2016 election. Asked in Finland whether he believed Mr. Putin over American intelligence agencies, Mr. Trump had said: “He just said it’s not Russia. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.” On Tuesday, he backtracked: “The sentence should have been, ‘I don’t see any reason why it wouldn’t be Russia,’ sort of a double negative. So you can put that in and I think that probably clarifies things pretty good.” (Read a transcript of his remarks.) • Mr. Trump didn’t address other comments he made on Monday, including criticism of the F.B.I. and the Justice Department, and his assertion that Mr. Putin had given an “extremely strong and powerful” denial of any election meddling.

827,"My official pundit’s opinion on Donald Trump, Russian election interference, collusion, kompromat and impeachment is that I’m waiting for the Mueller investigation to finish before I have a strong opinion. This allows me to cultivate the agnostic’s smug superiority, but it also leaves me without a suitably en fuego take after something like the immediately infamous Trump-Putin news conference — not because the president’s behavior wasn’t predictably disgraceful, but because the nature and scale of the disgrace can’t be assessed without a certainty about Trump’s motives that’s somewhat out of reach.      So maybe this is a good time to step back and sketch out the three main ways to understand Trump’s relationship to Russia and Putin and the 2016 hacking of his Democratic rivals, the three major theories that make sense of our president’s strange conduct before and since. I’m not going to formally choose among them, but for people interested in betting I will offer odds for each. In this theory of the case, you can explain all of Trump’s Russia-related behavior simply by finding him guilty of being the person we always knew him to be — vain, mendacious, self-serving, sleazy and absurdly stubborn, with a purely personalized understanding of allies and adversaries, a not-so-sneaking admiration for strongmen and the information filter of an old man who prefers his own reality to the discomforts of contrary information. Thus Trump is friendly to Putin for the same reason that he praised the Chinese Politburo after Tiananmen Square and now praises Xi Jinping; the same reason that he likes the Saudi royals and buddies up to Recep Tayyip Erdogan; the same reason that after a brief period of bellicosity he’s ended up as a tacit apologist for Kim Jong-un. We have ample evidence, going back decades, that Trump simply likes authoritarian rulers, that he admires their supposed toughness and doesn’t give a fig about their cruelty, that he thinks they would make more reliable allies and partners for the United States than the ingrate democracies of Western Europe. And as Ben Domenech of The Federalist noted after the Helsinki performance, we also have ample evidence that he likes people who seem to like him and considers anyone who criticizes him an enemy: “Thus, the Euros are bastards, and Xi and Kim and Putin are not bad guys.” If Trump seems to have a more intense affinity for Putin than for other autocrats, two further explanations may suffice. First, his history of doing business deals with Russians makes him particularly inclined to seek geopolitical deals with Russia — an inclination that’s essentially a shadier version of the affinity that the Bush family and other Arabists had with the Saudis and the Gulf States, cross-pollinated with the sleazy campaign-finance relationships that the Chinese cultivated with the Clinton White House. At the same time, his vanity and amour propre, joined to his rage against his doubters, makes it impossible for Trump to admit that anyone else helped him win the White House — so he cannot bring himself to fully acknowledge and criticize Russian election meddling because to do so might call into question not only his legitimacy but his self-conception as a political grandmaster. "
828,"This time, Trump’s crossed the line! He’s done! He’s finished! He’s toast! How many times do I remember this refrain, all the way back to the Mexican “rapists” remark more than three years ago that established Trump to the right of all his Republican rivals on immigration and so launched his campaign? Yet he’s not finished. Since then we’ve had Trump’s talk of “some form of punishment” for women having an abortion; and “grab ’em by the pussy” as his approach to women; and African nations as “shithole countries”; and his moral equivocation over the Charlottesville neo-Nazis who were not so bad really; and his Administration’s sadistic treatment of immigrant children; and the European Union as “foe”; and thousands of false or misleading statements since taking office; and now the disgusting spectacle of the American president kowtowing in Helsinki to Vladimir Putin, whose denial of Russian interference in the 2016 election he credits over the  findings of United States intelligence agencies! Yet he’s not done. Trump claims he misspoke in Helsinki when, alluding to his director of National Intelligence, he said: “My people came to me, Dan Coats came to me and some others, they said they think it’s Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it’s not Russia. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.” Now, Trump wants us to believe he wished to deploy a double negative, no less. A double negative! What he meant to say was: “I don’t see any reason why it WOULDN’T be Russia.” This is nonsense. Simple declarative sentences are also available, as in: “I believe that, in an act of aggression, Russian interfered in the 2016 election.” They have particular impact when the Russian president is standing next to you. No, Trump was in full Putin-pandering mode. He said that Putin was “extremely strong and powerful in his denial.” Besides, Russia is a place where Hillary Clinton’s 33,000 emails “wouldn’t be gone so easily.” "

830,"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. A year and a half ago, I walked out of The Baltimore Sun, where I had worked for the previous seven years, in tears. I had waited until everyone else had gone home, so I didn’t have to say any more goodbyes. We were all thrilled that I was going to The New York Times to cover the new education secretary, but we were an extraordinarily tight-knit community: My newsroom helped me pick out the menu for my wedding, and the name of my first child. And a quotation from a beloved editor, Mary Corey, anchored in the entrance after she died in 2013, had become my mantra: “In the end, what makes The Sun successful is people.” So, on June 28, when I learned of the shooting in a Maryland newsroom, it was like helplessly watching your house burn in real time with no recourse. I was at work in The Times’s Washington bureau when the text messages, my Twitter feed and the CNN chyron confirmed that there was an active shooter at The Capital Gazette, a paper owned by The Sun and an old stomping ground for many of my colleagues. Five people were killed — Rob Hiaasen, Gerald Fischman, Wendi Winters, John McNamara and Rebecca Smith. The communication that started pouring in from my friends was terrifying: The police had descended on the Sun building, which thankfully ended up being a precaution, and the newsroom staff were scared, scrambling, sobbing. Editors had started to assign obituaries. The Sun’s sister papers, owned by Tronc, immediately deployed their own journalists to help get The Capital Gazette out; other newsrooms sent food and care packages with stress toys. I told my editors that I would help in any way I could — that this was a family emergency. They were short-handed. The Sun needed people. (My editor, Jonathan Weisman, called it a “wonderful gesture,” but also noted that it reflected the “sad state of journalism in medium-sized markets.” He’d worked at The Sun from 1998 to 2000, when it had a Washington bureau staffed with 14 people. Now it has one.) "
831,"Does it seem strange that, according to a criminal complaint unsealed on Monday by the Justice Department, a Russian woman stands accused of “acting as an agent of a foreign government” in part because she hoped “to establish a back channel of communication” with American politicians at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington? It shouldn’t. As Jeff Sharlet, an associate professor of English at Dartmouth, has pointed out, the National Prayer Breakfast has long offered “a backdoor to American power.” And America’s homegrown Christian nationalists have evinced an admiration for Russia’s authoritarian leader that appears to have grown apace with his brutality. On Tuesday, Maria Butina, a 29-year-old Russian whose name was spelled Mariia in court papers, was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy and acting as an unregistered foreign agent for the Russian Federation.  According to the complaint unsealed on Monday, Ms. Butina’s promotional activities for Russian political interests included attending the National Prayer Breakfast twice. The National Prayer Breakfast was initiated in 1953 by a Methodist minister, Abraham Vereide, who had been leading Congressional prayer groups for a decade. The annual breakfast now attracts close to 4,000 participants and is hosted by members of Congress. But the real force behind the event remains Mr. Vereide’s Fellowship Foundation, also known as “The Family,” whose fundamental mission is to create a ruling consortium of Christ-centered political and community leaders. “The Family considers #nationalprayerbreakfast a recruiting device,” Mr. Sharlet, who has published two books about the group, tweeted on Monday. Lobbyists and foreign governments look forward to the event as a way to meet powerful people without, as Mr. Sharlet has reported, having to go through the State Department and normal vetting processes.

Months of speculation about Goldman Sachs’s succession plans ended yesterday when the bank named David Solomon as its next leader. But the handover from Lloyd Blankfein won’t lead to many changes in strategy. As Mr. Solomon told the NYT, “There’s not going to be a revolution, there’s going to be evolution at Goldman Sachs.” Goldman will continue its push to rely less on trading profits, seeking new revenue from online financial businesses like its Marcus lending arm. (And Mr. Solomon is likely to continue his side hustles as a DJ and restaurant owner.) What might change? The WSJ says Mr. Solomon wants his Goldman to have more disciplined and accountable managers, and better gender and work-life balance. He’ll also need lieutenants; contenders include John Waldron, a top deal maker, and Eric Lane, a co-head of investment management. But business is holding steady. Why shake things up?

European antitrust officials are expected to fine Google $5 billion today for abusing its power in the smartphone market, according to Bloomberg’s unnamed sources. That would be a record, and another sign of the E.U.’s desire to rein in American tech companies. And the current record? Another fine against Google: $2.7 billion, last year, for favoring its own services in search results. "
833,"BRUSSELS — European authorities fined Google a record $5.1 billion on Wednesday for abusing its power in the mobile phone market and ordered the company to alter its practices, in one of the most aggressive regulatory actions against American technology giants and one that may force lasting changes to smartphones. The European Union’s antitrust fine of 4.34 billion euros was almost double the bloc’s fine against Google last year over the company’s unfair favoring of its own services in internet search results. The penalty’s size highlighted Europe’s increasingly bold stance against the power of American tech firms, even as officials in the United States have taken a largely hands-off approach to the companies. The fine was coupled with remedies that would effectively loosen Google’s grip over its Android software, which is used in 80 percent of the world’s smartphones and is a key part of the Silicon Valley company’s business. Those changes, which European regulators ordered to take effect in 90 days, undercut Google’s ability to automatically include its own search and other apps in mobile devices, opening it to more competition in a market that it has dominated. “Google has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine,” said Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s antitrust chief. “These practices have denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits. They have denied European consumers the benefits of effective competition in the important mobile sphere.” The size of the fine, she added, “reflects the seriousness and the sustained nature” of Google’s actions. Google said it would appeal the decision, and the case is very likely to drag on for years. The company must deposit the fine in a holding account while the legal process unfolds. If Google ultimately loses an appeal, the money will be distributed among the European Union’s member states. "
834,"To the Editor: Re “A Besieged Trump Says He Misspoke on Vote Meddling” (front page, July 18): President Trump insists he misspoke in Helsinki when he sided with Vladimir Putin’s denials of Russian interference in the 2016 election. He now says he meant all along to say he supports the American intelligence assessments that Russia did engage in a cyberwar campaign against our country. O.K., Mr. President, we will give you a mulligan on this one. But the question for you then becomes: “What are you going to do about it?” If you now acknowledge Russia’s actions, you have a responsibility to punish Russia for its past actions and take strong measures to prevent any future cyberattacks on our nation. We look forward to your follow-up to your “correction” of the record regarding Helsinki. LARRY DEWITT, TUCSON To the Editor: Up to now, President Trump’s response to his statements that play badly has been to say, “I only meant it as a joke.” Now he’s added to his repertoire: “Did I say that? I meant to say exactly the opposite of that.” So when the president makes a statement, we can believe that it reflects his true thoughts; or we can think he may be joking; or maybe he meant to say the opposite of what he said. I’m glad we have that cleared up. STEPHEN POLIT, BELMONT, MASS. To the Editor: Regarding President Trump’s backtracking: He looked like a hostage reading a statement. It is obvious when a hostage is being forced to read and doesn’t subscribe to what he or she is reading. What was the point of his being forced to read a statement that the whole world, and Mr. Trump himself, knew was false? "
835,"WASHINGTON — President Trump sowed even more confusion on Wednesday over his recent meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin, insisting after a day of conflicting statements about Russia’s interference in the 2016 election that he had actually laid down the law with Mr. Putin. “I let him know we can’t have this,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with “CBS Evening News.” “We’re not going to have it, and that’s the way it’s going to be.” But that statement was almost completely at odds with how the president has characterized the meeting with Mr. Putin on Monday in Helsinki, Finland, and it contradicted an answer he appeared to give when asked earlier in the day if he believed Russia was still interfering in American elections and he said, “No.” The White House claimed Mr. Trump had yet again been misunderstood. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, said the president had said “no” only to whether he would take questions during a cabinet meeting, not to whether Russia was still interfering. “We believe that the threat still exists,” she said, “which is why we are taking steps to prevent it.” It was the second day of reversals and semantic hairsplitting in Mr. Trump’s statements about Russia — on Tuesday, he said that he had meant to say at a news conference in Helsinki that he disagreed with a statement by Mr. Putin, not that he agreed with it — and it only deepened the mystery of what exactly Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin had talked about during a two-and-a-half-hour session in Finland when only their interpreters were in the room with them. "
836,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) To understand the kind of re-election battle Representative Dana Rohrabacher is facing, take a look at a billboard overlooking Newport Boulevard in Costa Mesa. Larger-than-life images of Mr. Rohrabacher and President Trump face a quote attributed to Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader: “There are two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump.” Mr. Rohrabacher’s relationship with Russia is again under scrutiny. On Tuesday, he said that he had met with Maria Butina, who was indicted on charges of conspiracy and acting as a foreign agent, on a 2015 trip to Russia. But Mr. Rohrabacher dismissed the charges against her as “bogus.” And a day earlier, he gave the most enthusiastic defense of the president’s remarks in Helsinki. Mr. Rohrabacher’s close ties to Russia have provoked criticism from politicians even in his own party. And Democrats hope his support for the Kremlin will help lead to his defeat this November. But it is unclear whether that support will become a central issue in the campaign. Several voters in the district said they saw the outrage as a side issue propped up by Democrats. “He’s a good man who shares our values,” said Sandra Leach, 77, a Laguna Beach resident. “I don’t follow every twist and turn in this hunt, but I think it’s a bunch of politics driving it. We can’t become a socialist country with open borders.” Barry Lowe, 73, a retired aerospace manager, is volunteering for the Democratic challenger, Harley Rouda. But Russia, he said, is the least of it. “It’s time to get some liberals representing this area. It’s not the conservative wealthy place it once was,” Mr. Lowe said. “I don’t think Putin is a big factor. It’s part of a long list of things he does wrong. It’s simply that people here are split between the parties.” "
837,"At the heart of the trade war between the United States and China lies a profound and unsettling question: Who should control the key technologies that will rule tomorrow? It is unsettling because, right now, the trade war offers a dead-end choice. On one side, a handful of gigantic American corporations look destined to become the key players in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and advanced manufacturing and energy technologies. Or it could be a slightly larger handful of gigantic American and Chinese corporations, with healthy input from the Chinese government. These advances could alter everything about how we live and work. Shouldn’t some other entity, like maybe a democratically elected government, have some input in their rollout? Here’s a crazy idea. The United States could outline a plan for and put money behind an alternative vision for the global technology industry. If executed carefully, such a plan could stimulate wider competition in tech, and allow for broader economic and social gains. Perhaps a whole set of new companies, rather than just the giants you’re used to, could plan a role in the future. Does this sound un-American? It shouldn’t. Not long ago, when Americans faced the possibility of being left behind by other countries’ advancing tech, the federal government stepped in with nearly endless resources to stimulate the creation of vast new industries. Thanks to government funding, we got the nuclear industry, the space program, the aviation industry and the internet, which was initially sponsored by the Defense Department. Just about every key component in a smartphone, from the battery to GPS, is based on research first done for the American government. It’s not an overstatement to say that, for better or worse, the American government invented the modern world. "
838,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said on Wednesday that it was starting an investigation into uranium imports, potentially opening another front in an expansive trade war that has shaken alliances with countries around the world. Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, said the department would investigate whether imported uranium ore and related products — key ingredients in America’s nuclear arsenal, and used in power production and nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers — threatened national security. Uranium produced domestically now fills only 5 percent of America’s needs, Mr. Ross said, down from half in 1987. The uranium inquiry is the latest of several trade-related steps the Trump administration has taken with an eye toward imposing stiff tariffs on imports. Levies have already been placed on washing machines, solar-power products, steel and aluminum from overseas, and on an array of Chinese goods. The administration is also considering whether to impose tariffs on imported cars and car parts. The investigation announced on Wednesday was requested by two American uranium mining companies, Ur-Energy and Energy Fuels. The firms say low-priced imports, especially those from competitors supported by foreign government subsidies, had caused them to slash jobs in recent years. Nuclear power producers have responded by warning that sharp restrictions on uranium imports could lead to the closing of plants. The uranium imported into the United States now comes mostly from Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan and Russia. "
839,"WASHINGTON — Montenegro may have a few questions for President Trump. In an interview that aired Tuesday evening with the Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Mr. Trump appeared to suggest that the NATO mutual defense compact is confusing, particularly the question of why an American would have to defend a small country like Montenegro, which is more than 5,000 miles away. Mr. Trump has long raised questions about the future of the United States’ commitment to NATO, a defense treaty that was established to stave off aggression from what was then the Soviet Union. Montenegro joined the alliance in 2017, a year after Russia plotted a coup to overthrow Montenegro’s government and replace it with one that would be hostile toward NATO. On Tuesday, Mr. Carlson asked Mr. Trump: “So, let’s say Montenegro — which joined last year — is attacked, why should my son go to Montenegro to defend it from attack? Why is that?” Mr. Trump immediately acknowledged the concern. “I understand what you’re saying,” Mr. Trump said. “I’ve asked the same question.” The answer, which Mr. Trump did not articulate in the interview, can be found in Article 5 of the treaty: If one NATO country is attacked, all NATO countries will be considered under attack as well and will join in defense. The president continued, “Montenegro is a tiny country with very strong people.” He added: “They have very aggressive people. They may get aggressive, and congratulations, you’re in World War III, now I understand that — but that’s the way it was set up.” "
840,"WASHINGTON — For four years, a Russian accused of being a covert agent pursued a brazen effort to infiltrate conservative circles and influence powerful Republicans while she secretly was in contact with Russian intelligence operatives, a senior Russian official and a billionaire oligarch close to the Kremlin whom she called her “funder,” federal prosecutors said on Wednesday. The woman, Maria Butina, carried out her campaign through a series of deceptions that began in 2014, if not earlier, prosecutors said. She lied to obtain a student visa to pursue graduate work at American University in 2016. Apparently hoping for a work visa that would grant her a longer stay, she offered one American sex in exchange for a job. She moved in with a Republican political operative nearly twice her age, describing him as her boyfriend. But she privately expressed “disdain” for him and had him do her homework, prosecutors said. In a dramatic two-hour hearing in Federal District Court here, prosecutors said that Ms. Butina, who is charged with conspiracy and illegally acting as an agent of the Russian government, was the point person in a calculated, long-term campaign intended to steer high-level politicians toward Moscow’s objectives. Though prosecutors did not name any party or politician, Ms. Butina’s efforts were clearly aimed at Republican leaders, especially those with White House aspirations in 2016, including Donald J. Trump. She “should be considered on a par with other covert Russian agents,” prosecutors said in a memo. [Read the court papers.] Over all, they described what appears to be another arm of the Russian government’s attempts to influence or gain information about the American political process. While Russian military intelligence officers were hacking into the computers and email accounts of the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, Ms. Butina was building connections on the Republican side under the direction of an official believed to be Alexander Torshin, the deputy head of the Russian central bank, who has established ties to Russian security services, according to the court filings. Secretly, she and others laid the groundwork for a $125,000 operation to connect with Republican leaders through a network of contacts with the National Rifle Association and conservative religious groups, including the organizers of the National Prayer Breakfast, prosecutors said. “The defendant’s covert influence campaign involved substantial planning, international coordination and preparation,” they said. "
841,"AINISSA, Syria — The two-story building here still looks much like the school it once was. But the classrooms are closed off by reinforced black doors, padlocked from the outside. And the campus is surrounded by men with machine guns seeking refuge from the desert heat in the shade of towering concrete perimeter walls. The visitors’ echoing footsteps and voices were the only sounds on a recent day in a dusty pink-and-white hallway once filled with schoolchildren. But when a guard slid open a small window in a classroom door, a man’s face pressed against the opening. Behind him, about 15 others, sitting on mats in black sleeveless shirts, stared back. The old school is one of about seven makeshift wartime prisons in northern Syria housing suspects accused of fighting for the Islamic State and captured by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. The S.D.F. prisons for male detainees — about 1,000 men from nearly 50 countries — are generally off limits, but a New York Times reporter accompanied a congressional delegation touring two of them, the first such visit to either. The prisoners pose a dilemma that has no easy solution and that is growing urgent. Their home countries have been reluctant to take back the men. Their governments are leery that battle-hardened members of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, might radicalize domestic prisoners. Some countries face legal hurdles to prosecuting militants if they take custody of them from a nonstate militia, as opposed to extraditing them from another government. But the S.D.F. is unlikely to hold them forever. A debate is brewing inside the United States government about whether to take a few of them — either for prosecution in civilian court or to the wartime prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba — but even that leaves open the fate of the rest. The uncertainty looms as a threat to the rest of the world, said Christopher P. Costa, a former senior director for counterterrorism on President Trump’s National Security Council who now heads the International Spy Museum. He pointed to the “wandering mujahedeen” of the 1980s who fought in Afghanistan, then metastasized Islamist mayhem to places like Bosnia. "

The four Republicans — James Inhofe and James Lankford of Oklahoma, Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky — requested an investigation into whether the grants, which have been in place for almost ten years, violated federal law. Scientists who work with meteorologists on climate change dispute the accusations. Edward Maibach, director of the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University, whose research center helps distribute the grants, noted that climate change is established science and that most Americans acknowledge that.

843,"Novartis, the Swiss drugmaker, said Wednesday that it would not raise prices on its products in the United States for the rest of 2018, joining Pfizer, which delayed its increases last week after President Trump singled out the company for criticism. Novartis’s chief executive, Vas Narasimhan, said during an earnings call with investors that the company had made the decision in June, amid escalating outrage over high drug prices. “We thought that was prudent, given the dynamic environment we’re currently in,” he said. A spokesman for Novartis said the company notified the state of California, which has a new drug-price transparency law, of its decision in June, but the news was not widely known. Novartis’s stock was trading at about $80 at midday on Wednesday, up 2.35 percent. Pharmaceutical companies are scrambling to stem the groundswell of criticism over steep drug pricing, as elected officials and the Trump administration have taken up the issue. Earlier this year, the Trump administration released a detailed plan, and the proposal has generated more than 2,000 comments from a range of interest groups that submitted their opinions before a federal deadline on Monday. At a bill-signing in May, Mr. Trump said that major drug companies would, within two weeks, enact “voluntary massive drops” in prices, a statement that was met with puzzlement within the industry. The president’s prediction did not materialize. Last week, after reports that Pfizer was raising prices by nearly 10 percent on many products, including widely used drugs like the pain reliever Lyrica, Mr. Trump slammed the company on Twitter. The next day, Pfizer’s announcement that it would hold off on the price increases was rewarded with a glowing presidential tweet, which concluded: “Great news for the American people!” Mr. Narasimhan did not meet directly with Mr. Trump, but the company said it had been in touch with the Health and Human Services department over the administration’s plan to lower prices. That department is headed by Alex M. Azar II, a former executive at the drugmaker Eli Lilly. Novartis’s decision follows its entanglement with the administration over revelations in May that the company paid $1.2 million to Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, as a political consultant. Although Novartis previously said that it did not ultimately rely on Mr. Cohen’s services, a report released last week by Senate Democrats concluded the relationship went deeper than the company had previously acknowledged. Novartis has disputed that it misrepresented its relationship with Mr. Cohen. The company has said it spoke to lawyers for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is examining Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and that it considers its role in that investigation to have ended. Nevertheless, Mr. Narasimhan has sought to distance himself from the controversy, noting that Mr. Cohen was hired by his predecessor, Joe Jimenez, and describing the arrangement as a “mistake.” In May, the company announced that its top lawyer, Felix R. Ehrat, was retiring over the issue. "
844,"MADRID — First it couldn’t float. Now, it can’t dock. The Spanish military’s new submarine has been plagued by engineering problems and cost overruns during development, and the government will end up spending millions more than it had planned for the project. Years ago, the S-80 submarine suffered a major engineering setback: It was overweight and at risk of not being able to resurface after submerging. In the latest hitch, first reported on Wednesday by the newspaper El País, it can’t fit into the port of Cartagena at the military base in southeastern Spain where the submarine will be stationed. Margarita Robles, the country’s defense minister, acknowledged on Wednesday that there had been “deficiencies in the project,” but she insisted it remained “absolutely viable.” Navantia, the state-controlled shipbuilder contracted by the government to build the submarine, could not immediately be reached for comment. The newest problem will force Spain’s government to soon announce a budget increase for the project. Each of the four new submarines will end up costing almost $1.2 billion, nearly double the initial budget, according to El País. After the buoyancy problems were discovered in 2013, the submarine was redesigned and lengthened by about 33 feet. But the changes did not properly take into account the size of the docks in Cartagena. "
845,"WASHINGTON — When the White House named Kathleen Kraninger in June to be the next director of a post-crisis consumer watchdog, many of the agency’s fiercest critics and its most ardent supporters had the same response: Who? On Thursday, Ms. Kraninger will be anonymous no longer. After years of working as a career bureaucrat and congressional staff member, she will take a seat in the spotlight when senators from both parties examine her credentials to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency beloved by Democrats and excoriated by Republicans since its inception seven years ago. While Ms. Kraninger, an official at the Office of Management and Budget, is expected to take a much more business-friendly approach to consumer protection than many Democrats would like, her nomination presents something of a Hobson’s choice. Scuttling her confirmation would extend the tenure of Mick Mulvaney, the agency’s acting director and the head of the budget office, who has tried to cripple the consumer bureau by freezing enforcement activity, calling for deep budget cuts and halting new investigations. Critics say Ms. Kraninger, 43, is likely to pursue a similar path as Mr. Mulvaney, with whom she has worked closely at the White House budget office, where she serves as associate director for general government. In her current role, Ms. Kraninger oversees the budgets for a wide swath of government agencies, including the Treasury Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. But she has little experience with the consumer finance products and businesses that the watchdog agency was created to police, including lenders in the auto financing, credit card, and payday and student loan sectors. “I had never heard of her because she has no record or experience in financial regulation,” said J. W. Verret, a scholar at the conservative Mercatus Center Working Group on Financial Markets. “I suspect that it will be a bumpy ride.” "
846,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Do you remember the secret tape of a meeting that House Republicans held in 2016, later discovered by The Washington Post? “There’s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump,” Kevin McCarthy, the second-ranking House Republican, told his colleagues during the meeting. Some of those colleagues then laughed, and McCarthy added: “Swear to God.” Rohrabacher is Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican member of Congress from California with a long history of pro-Russian sympathies. Trump, of course, was then the leading Republican candidate for president. And the last few days have highlighted the alarming Russian ties to both men. On Tuesday, a Justice Department investigation led to the indictment of Maria Butina, charged with being a Kremlin agent posing as a pro-gun activist. The affidavit in the case mentions a planned meeting between a prominent Russian official and an unnamed member of the United States Congress. That member, according to media reports, is Rohrabacher. President Trump, meanwhile, tried to do some damage control yesterday. He walked back — sort of — his obviously false Monday claim that the Russians didn’t interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. But his walkback was so grudging — and he quickly undermined it — that it seemed designed not to be persuasive. It instead seemed designed merely to be just strong enough to get some positive headlines and to allow Trump’s allies to wave away the whole incident. “Likely the main reason Trump ‘clarified’ his comments: To give GOPers cover,” David Joachim of Bloomberg tweeted. Senators Marco Rubio and Rob Portman were among the Republicans who did precisely that, pretending the problem was now solved. It’s not. There are plenty of reasons to wonder if the president of the United States has financial (or other) ties to a hostile foreign power. The same may apply to a member of Congress. It’s time for the rest of Congress to use its Constitutional power and figure out the truth. Elsewhere. Republicans’ rigmarole on Trump and Russia fits a pattern, notes Vanity Fair’s Bess Levin. “Republicans have made a cottage industry of publicly taking umbrage at things Trump has done — whether it’s leaking classified information to Russian envoys, siding with Nazis, or destroying our alliances abroad — and then proceeding to insist that their hands are tied,” she writes. In The Times, the editorial board, Ross Douthat, Katherine Stewart and William Webster, a Republican former director of the F.B.I. and C.I.A., all write about Russia. "
847,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump’s shifting narratives this week underscore the degree to which he picks and chooses intelligence to suit his political purposes. Two weeks before his inauguration, he was shown highly classified intelligence showing that President Vladimir Putin of Russia had personally ordered efforts to disrupt the 2016 election. But since then, Mr. Trump has sought to spread the blame for the meddling. This week alone, he accepted the Russian leader’s denial of election interference, backtracked on that point, said that he didn’t believe the problem was still continuing, and then said of his meeting with Mr. Putin: “I let him know we can’t have this. We’re not going to have it, and that’s the way it’s going to be.” If his comments about Russian election interference have changed, Mr. Trump has been consistent on one point: his portrayal of the intelligence officials who delivered the original briefing as political hacks. • Adding to questions of deception is the case of a Russian woman, Maria Butina, who was arrested over the weekend and accused of being a covert agent in a secret effort to influence American politics. "
848,"SPARTANBURG, S.C. — In the middle of David Britt’s campaign to get BMW to put a car factory in this city, a man grabbed him by the tie while he was in a restaurant. “Don’t give that land to the Germans,” the man hissed to Mr. Britt, a county official. Two decades later, the automaker has become the most important local job creator, earning the affection of a deep-red county where one in 10 people earns a living making vehicles or their parts. The Spartanburg plant is BMW’s biggest in the world. It has helped draw more than 200 companies from two dozen countries to Spartanburg County. And the German company — not an American icon like Ford or General Motors — is now the largest exporter of cars made in the United States, turning the port of Charleston, S.C., into a hub for global trade. But by setting off a global trade battle, President Trump is threatening the town’s livelihood. People aren’t happy. "
849,"The Sinclair Broadcast Group’s plan to create a broadcasting behemoth that it hoped would rival Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News appears to be coming to an end. Already the largest local television operator in the nation, Sinclair agreed last year to buy the rival TV group Tribune Media for $3.5 billion. The deal would have given the combined company control of broadcasters reaching seven in 10 households across the country, including in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. But in light of the Federal Communications Commission’s draft order this week questioning whether Sinclair was sufficiently transparent in how it represented the deal to regulators and whether a merger would be in the public interest, Tribune said in a statement Thursday that it was “evaluating its implications and assessing all of our options.” The merger agreement allows either side to walk away from the deal if it does not close by Aug. 8. Sinclair declined to comment. This week has brought a stunning shift in momentum for a deal that once seemed almost assured of being completed, thanks in no small part to policy changes proposed or enacted by the F.C.C. and advocated by Sinclair. The commission had also eased a cap on how many stations a broadcaster can own and relaxed a restriction on advertising revenue and other resources shared by television stations. But on Monday, the agency’s chairman, Ajit Pai — who is the subject of an investigation by the office of the F.C.C.’s inspector general regarding his new policies — said he had “serious concerns” about the Sinclair-Tribune merger. Mr. Pai asked the agency’s four commissioners to hand off its review of the merger to an administrative law judge to determine the legality of Sinclair’s proposal. "

851,"WASHINGTON — Richard Smallwood describes himself as a “pretty far right-wing conservative” and a longtime supporter of President Trump. But like many in the auto industry, Mr. Smallwood, the president of the tire company Sumitomo Rubber North America, has been puzzled and dismayed by the president’s proposal to impose tariffs on foreign automobiles and their parts. “He’s the president of the United States, and I just sell tires,” said Mr. Smallwood, whose company imports tires from abroad. “I have to be careful about second-guessing him, but I wish it were a more logical approach.” On Thursday, Mr. Smallwood appeared at a government hearing on the sweeping tariffs the administration is now considering, along with other suppliers, and representatives from car companies and foreign countries. Unlike the previous hearing on the administration’s metals tariffs, which drew some support, the testimony of those who appeared on Thursday was almost uniformly negative and punctuated with concerns about how tariffs would raise their costs, stifle innovation and dampen their plans for expansion and hiring. “Every aspect of the U.S. automotive value chain is united in its concern on this issue,” said John Bozzella, the chief executive of Global Automakers, which represents international car companies. “You cannot find a company that has asked for this protection.” Whether Mr. Trump listens will be a big test of whether his protectionist instincts will prevail over the concerns of an industry he has continually vowed to protect. Labor unions have been more supportive of the Trump administration’s efforts, though they have warned about the potential harm of disrupting global supply chains and urged Mr. Trump to proceed carefully. In testimony on Thursday morning, Jennifer Kelly, the director of research at the United Auto Workers union, said that American workers had been harmed by decades of offshoring, and that a comprehensive investigation into the effect of foreign production on domestic manufacturing was “long overdue.” "
852,"When it emerged last week that John Schnatter, the founder of Papa John’s Pizza, had used a racial slur in a business meeting to quote what he said Colonel Sanders called blacks, much attention was paid to his use of the word but little to the point he was trying to make. Mr. Schnatter was criticized for his own criticism of African-American N.F.L. players who took a knee during the playing of the national anthem. That was unfair, he was saying, when one considered that KFC had suffered no fallout from its founder’s far more offensive remarks. (I have found no documentation that Sanders used such language.) Mr. Schnatter was making a what-about argument. Of course he was. Today, a political or ideological point, or a defense against public criticism, is at least as likely to be of this variety as any other. Here are two examples out of thousands in the public square: After President Trump met with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, “The Daily Show” tweeted a video clip from Sean Hannity’s Fox News show from the night before, side by side with some of Mr. Hannity’s sound bites from the past. First we heard the current Hannity praising Mr. Trump for talking with the Korean autocrat. “There’s no downside to what happened here at all,” Mr. Hannity said. “Only a win as far as I’m concerned.” Then we heard 2010 Hannity: “President Obama, catering to the world’s dictators, is literally the Neville Chamberlain of our time.” “It’s not wise, it’s not in our best interest,” his past self went on to say, this time in 2013. “We’re dealing with the world’s worst dictators, and we’re showing a lot of weakness.” "
853,"WICHITA, Kan. — Is the white working class an angry, backward monolith — some 90 million white Americans without college degrees, all standing around in factories and fields thumping their dirty hands with baseball bats? You might think so after two years of media fixation on this version of the aggrieved laborer: male, Caucasian, conservative, racist, sexist. This account does white supremacy a great service in several ways: It ignores workers of color, along with humane, even progressive white workers. It allows college-educated white liberals to signal superior virtue while denying the sins of their own place and class. And it conceals well-informed, formally educated white conservatives —  from middle-class suburbia to the highest ranks of influence — who voted for Donald Trump in legions. The trouble begins with language: Elite pundits regularly misuse “working class” as shorthand for right-wing white guys wearing tool belts. My father, a white man and lifelong construction worker who labors alongside immigrants and people of color on job sites across the Midwest and South working for a Kansas-based general contractor owned by a woman, would never make such an error. Most struggling whites I know live lives of quiet desperation mad at their white bosses, not resentment of their co-workers or neighbors of color. My dad’s previous three bosses were all white men he loathed for abuses of privilege and people. It is unfair power that my father despises. The last rant I heard him on was not about race or immigration but about the recent royal wedding, the spectacle of which made him sick. “What’s so special about the royals?” he told me over the phone from a cheap motel after work. “But they’ll get the best health care, the best education, the best food. Meanwhile I’m in Marion, Arkansas. All I want is some chickens and a garden and place to go fishing once in a while.” "
854,"China has become a global leader in policy and diplomacy on limiting the effects of climate change, but it still needs to take significant steps to curb its own carbon dioxide emissions, according to a report released on Thursday. The report, written by David Sandalow, a former United States energy official now at Columbia University, takes a broad look at emissions and coal use in 2017 in China, which is by far the world’s top emitter of the heat-trapping gases that accelerate climate change. The study also analyses recent policy moves on climate by the country’s government and by the Communist Party. China has wide-ranging climate policies, enshrined in the national Five-Year Plans and in blueprints at provincial and local levels. As a result, the report says, it is on its way to meeting major climate change goals, including lowering a measure known as carbon intensity, having carbon dioxide emissions reach a peak no later than 2030 and having a fifth of energy come from non-fossil-fuel sources by that year. At the same time, the report says, if China’s carbon emissions continue at the current pace, nations will find it harder to meet important climate change policy goals — most notably limiting the average global temperature increase to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 2 degrees Celsius, above preindustrial levels. Even if China’s emissions decrease after 2030, that goal could be much harder to achieve unless they then drop rapidly. In 2017, China emitted 11.7 billion metric tons of heat-trapping gases, a quarter of the world’s total. That included 9.2 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, the gas most responsible for accelerated climate change, more than the total for the United States and the European Union combined. "
855,Watch out for the claws. 
856,"MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia warned on Thursday that certain political forces in the United States — a formulation that usually refers to a supposed anti-Russian cabal in the American national security establishment — were trying to undermine what he called a successful meeting this week with President Trump. “We see that there are forces in the United States that can easily sacrifice Russian-U.S. relations for the sake of their own ambitions,” Mr. Putin said in a foreign policy speech to Russian ambassadors. “Let’s see how the events develop, especially considering that certain forces are trying to disavow the results of the meeting in Helsinki.” The comments came after Mr. Trump, who was criticized by representatives from both parties for suggesting that he had accepted Russian denials of interference in the 2016 election, contrary to the conclusions of American intelligence agencies, sought to clarify his comments at a cabinet meeting in Washington. Mr. Trump said that, in fact, he did accept the agencies’ conclusions. Russia, while developing its foreign policy toward the United States, should consider the efforts of a “quite powerful” group in Washington that seeks to undermine good relations between the countries, Mr. Putin said on Thursday. The comments were some of the most extensive to date by Mr. Putin about the Russian view about whether a “deep state” of national security elites dominates American politics and is conspiring to thwart Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump, too, seemed to feel that the talks in Finland were fruitful and underappreciated. “The Summit with Russia was a great success, except with the real enemy of the people, the Fake News Media,” he said on Twitter. “I look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed, including stopping terrorism, security for Israel, nuclear.” "
857,"President Trump resumed his criticism of the European Union on Thursday, assailing the bloc for the record antitrust fine it levied against the Silicon Valley giant Google this week. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denounced the 28-nation group, America’s biggest trading partner, for what he says are its unfair economic policies. His administration has imposed stiff tariffs on aluminum and steel imported from European Union companies, and is also considering placing similarly hefty levies on European cars and car parts. The president’s broader protectionist push, his specific labeling of the European Union as a “foe” on the issue of trade and his remarks raising questions about his commitment to NATO have led to a substantial cooling of the relationship between the longtime trans-Atlantic allies. The European countries have sought to tamp down the rhetoric — Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, is to meet with Mr. Trump next week — but they have also refused to back down in the face of the president’s threatened tariffs. On Thursday, Mr. Trump said in a message posted on Twitter that the European Union’s $5.1 billion fine against Google, a punishment for its anticompetitive practices in the smartphone market, was a slap against “one of our great companies.” [Read more about the fine and its implications for Google.] “They truly have taken advantage of the U.S.,” Mr. Trump wrote, adding a suggestion of retribution to come. “but not for long!” The fine, of 4.34 billion euros, was by far the largest ever handed down in Europe for antitrust violations, and was coupled with a demand that Google loosen its grip on its Android mobile operating system or risk further financial penalties. It was the latest move by European regulators to crack down on American technology companies. Officials across the region have pursued tougher rules on data privacy and competition, while also investigating Silicon Valley firms over their tax practices and other matters. Those firms, whose services are extremely popular in Europe, have complained that they are being unfairly targeted, a claim that officials in the region deny. "
858,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) It stretches more than 650 miles, from south of Los Angeles to north of San Francisco, through Big Sur and across the Golden Gate Bridge, and knits together all that encapsulates California in the national imagination: the Pacific Coast, the redwood forests, the automobile. For the first time in more than a year, California’s Highway 1 — more commonly called the Pacific Coast Highway — is open without interruption, after a chunk of it was wiped away in a massive landslide last year. In a morning fog on Wednesday — at 9:45 a.m. to be precise, according to a tweet by the California Department of Public Transportation — the piece of the road at Mud Creek, south of the Big Sur region, that had cut off so many travelers, was reopened. The most famous California road trip was back on. “It’s a combination of relief and celebration,” said Kirk Gafill, who owns a restaurant in Big Sur called Nepenthe. Mr. Gafill said the reopening of the highway marked the end of a two-year struggle against Mother Nature that had disrupted tourism, beginning with the Soberanes Fire, a large wildfire near Big Sur that burned more than 130,000 acres in 2016. Like other business owners in the region, Mr. Gafill had seen a sharp fall in visitors. Businesses in the area like his, he said, had lost anywhere between 15 percent to 40 percent of revenue because of the Mud Creek landslide. Hotels and inns lost more because fewer visitors from Southern California were coming and staying overnight. Visitors from the south could still get to Big Sur through a treacherous detour inland that involved steep cliffs and hairpin turns, but many stayed away. "
859,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. It’s become a pattern: President Trump says something outrageous. He later grudgingly retracts his statement, or members of his administration retract it on his behalf. And then he quickly undermines the retraction. It happened with the attacks by white supremacists in Charlottesville and with other race-baiting issues. This week alone, the pattern has been visible multiple times, on Russia and NATO. So what explains it? What could Trump possibly be accomplishing with this blatant dissembling? Something important and devious, actually. He is sending two different messages, each intended for a different audience. With the initial statement, he’s talking to his primary audience. Often, that audience is his political base, and Trump is signaling that he’s with them: He, too, is a white nationalist, or at the very least he’s sympathetic to them. He believes that dark-skinned people live in miserable countries, that Mexicans are rapists, that Muslims should be banned from America and that some white supremacists are “very fine people.” Over the past week, for whatever reason, Trump’s primary audience has seemed to be Vladimir Putin. Trump repeatedly sent messages that Putin must have liked — that NATO is a mess, that Russia didn’t interfere in the election and that the Trump administration would consider handing over an American citizen to Putin’s government for questioning.

860,"Good Thursday. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. The European Commission hit Google with a record antitrust fine yesterday for its deals with smartphone makers to give pride of place to its own apps, such as the Chrome browser, in its Android operating system. The E.U. also ordered Google to change several practices. The goal: more competition on smartphones. But as the WSJ argues, it may already be too late for that. As this case plays out — the appeals could last years — smartphone apps will lose ground to voice assistants, virtual reality and the like. Which will have their own antitrust issues. The E.U. might hope to make Google tread more carefully during the next tech wave, as Microsoft did on mobile after being punished for how it pushed its internet browser. But companies seem to do pretty well after huge antitrust fines. Why would Google ease up? The social network is promising to remove misinformation that could cause violence. Rumors spread on Facebook have ignited attacks on ethnic minorities in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and India. The NYT explains, for instance, how WhatsApp led mobs to murder in India. But Mark Zuckerberg misstepped when describing the policy. Discussing how to balance free speech and safety in an interview with Recode, he gave Holocaust denial as an example of something that might not deserve deletion. "
861,"SAN DIEGO — Steve Mollenkopf, the chief executive of Qualcomm, has been waiting for a phone call with news from China. It has been a long wait. His company, which makes chips that help mobile phones communicate, has been on extended hold while the Chinese authorities review a deal that Qualcomm struck 20 months ago to buy another chip maker, NXP Semiconductors. Mr. Mollenkopf said Qualcomm had done all it could to persuade Beijing to approve the $44 billion transaction, which the companies have said will be terminated next Wednesday without regulatory consent. But both the acquisition and Qualcomm have now become entangled in the trade war raging between the United States and China. China’s prolonged review of the deal for NXP is widely seen by analysts and trade experts as part of Beijing’s retaliation for President Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods. “We want to see it get done,” Mr. Mollenkopf, 49, said in an interview at Qualcomm’s headquarters in San Diego. When asked if his company was caught in the trade war, he said, “That’s probably accurate.” The situation, which may be a sign of what is to come for other multinationals that also have interests dependent on China, is laced with irony. In March, Mr. Trump moved to protect Qualcomm when his administration blocked a $117 billion hostile takeover bid for the company by another chip maker, Broadcom. At the time, Mr. Trump said the deal would “impair the national security of the United States” after a government committee found that Broadcom would most likely reduce vital Qualcomm wireless research to the benefit of Chinese companies. Now Mr. Trump may end up hurting the company that he sought to shield, in an unintended consequence of the mounting trade hostilities that his administration has spearheaded. Mr. Mollenkopf and others have said buying NXP, a Dutch chip maker, is important to helping Qualcomm move more quickly into technology for cars and other new markets. "
862,"NORTH AURORA, Ill. — Most of the room’s occupants looked nothing like Lauren Underwood, but no one seemed to care. Ms. Underwood, the Democratic congressional nominee in northern Illinois’s pivotal 14th District, flowed effortlessly from person to person at a meet-and-greet last month, confident in her belief that she, a 31-year-old black woman, was best suited to represent a community that is overwhelmingly white. “I learned to be a black woman in this community,” Ms. Underwood said. “This is my home, and the idea that I might not be a good fit is an idea I never gave a lot of consideration to.” Kathy Birkett, a former school superintendent who came to the event to support Ms. Underwood, said the candidate’s ideas about health care and reducing gun violence are what helped her draw support from a cross-section of voters in the district. “When you’re top notch, you’re top notch — and I don’t think that has anything to do with color,” she said. A decade after the election of America’s first black president, Ms. Underwood and several other African-American, Hispanic and minority candidates for Congress are facing a major test this fall: whether they can win in districts where white voters make up the majority of the electorate. Like Barack Obama, these contenders — most of them Democrats — often strain to avoid explicit discussions of race out of fear of alienating white voters, which stands in contrast to the uncompromising insurgent challengers that have taken hold in the post-Obama era like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York House candidate, or Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia. "
863,"ISTANBUL — Even before President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey was inaugurated last week, he began elbowing his way into the front ranks of the globe’s strongmen. Hours before taking the oath of office — after 15 years already in power — Mr. Erdogan published a 143-page decree changing the way almost every government department and public body in the country operates. In the days since, he has issued several equally lengthy decrees and presidential decisions, centralizing power and giving him the ability to exert control in nearly all areas of life with almost unchecked authority. At a moment when democratic systems around the world are under increasing pressure, Mr. Erdogan, who was re-elected in June, is among those leaders, like Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Viktor Orban of Hungary, who are using the levers of democracy to vastly expand their authority. Among the changes Mr. Erdogan has put in place under the new presidential system are these: • The prime minister’s office has been abolished; • The military has been brought under firmer civilian control; • The president will draft the budget and choose judges and many top officials; • The president can dismiss Parliament and call new elections at will; "
864,"As some of the Democratic Party’s wealthier donors nibbled on appetizers at a Michelin-starred restaurant on the Brooklyn waterfront last month, Nancy Pelosi began to preach the urgency of defining the Democratic Party’s future. About 90 seconds in, Ms. Pelosi, the longtime leader of the House Democrats, abruptly stopped. “Actually, Hakeem, come up here and tell them our plans for the future,” Ms. Pelosi said, according to multiple people who were present. What followed was a seemingly off-the-cuff 10-minute monologue by Representative Hakeem Jeffries of Brooklyn, who outlined a blueprint to win back the House for a Democratic Party desperate for fresh faces. And Mr. Jeffries, a 47-year-old black lawmaker, has emerged as one of them: an intriguing voice of the aspiring next generation in Congress. “Hakeem is one of the rising stars of the Democratic Party,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, said in an interview. “All I can tell you is, he’s got a great future. He’s got limitless possibilities — national, state, local, you name it.” With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s stunning defeat of Representative Joseph Crowley of Queens last month, the House Democratic leadership will have a glaring vacancy. And in a fractious conference where race, geography, seniority and ideology all can loom large, an ambitious young New Yorker like Mr. Jeffries could be ascendant. "
865,"In 1971, Pamela Mason was a college freshman living in Ohio when she got pregnant. She knew immediately that she wanted an abortion, but the procedure was heavily restricted in her state. Still, she wanted to find a way. The clinic near her university’s campus referred her to an abortion clinic in Manhattan, and when she was about 10 weeks along, Ms. Mason and her boyfriend scraped together enough money to drive to New York City. Three years before Roe v. Wade established a constitutional right to abortion, New York legalized the procedure in 1970, turning the state into a magnet for women who wanted to terminate their pregnancies but were barred from doing so where they lived. “I was very relieved because New York was doable. It was 500 miles away,” said Ms. Mason, now 64 and a human resources manager living in New Jersey. The New York law allowed abortions to be performed within 24 weeks of pregnancy and at any time if the woman’s life was at risk. In the first two years after it was passed, health officials estimated that more than 400,000 abortions were performed in the state. Nearly two-thirds of those procedures were for women who had traveled from outside New York to take advantage of the policy. "
866,"Recently, the founders of an Instagram account called “Every Outfit on Sex and the City” threw a fund-raising bash for Cynthia Nixon’s campaign for New York governor. They kicked it off with some softballs for the crowd: Team Aidan? Or Team Big? Then, they ushered in Ms. Nixon. At first, the candidate was sharper on politics than she was on Miranda — to be fair, it’s been eight years since “Sex and the City 2” — and she seemed concerned that the hosts were mocking the character. But Ms. Nixon soon found the pulse of the event and began to dish, telling stories of outfit choices she had made — a neck scarf that Miranda wears during a speed date was her idea — and scenes that never made it to air. She described with gusto the episode in which Miranda eats cake out of the garbage, explaining that she and the director, Allen Coulter, had shot an alternate take as a homage to “Psycho,” with Miranda eating the cake in a frenzy, smearing it all over her face and, finally, collapsing and dragging her hand down the refrigerator, leaving chocolate streak in its wake. (The scene, sadly, is not yet available on YouTube.) She was also fully prepared for a question about the more problematic aspects of the show. “‘Sex and the City’ started 20 years ago, and I’m very keenly aware of this,” she said, adding that one of the chief failings of the show was its focus on “a very, very thin slice of an extremely white and extremely affluent part of New York.” And while she called it a feminist show, she said that “the flaws of the feminist movement are reflected in ‘Sex and the City,’ too.” If a candidate for governor coming to terms with a character she played on a show that was both beloved and (sometimes) cringeworthy with the help of an Instagram account that started as a fashion project and quickly evolved into a combination of fan-fiction and meme-play sounds like something that could only have happened after 2016, well, yes. Everything that can be political is pulled more strongly in that direction these days, and that gravity has helped shape the account as much as its creators have — and has made them natural surrogates for Ms. Nixon, even though they will not be able to vote for her. Chelsea Fairless and Lauren Garroni, the account’s thirtysomething Californian creators, were dressed boldly for a rare public appearance. (They are all but anonymous to many of their fans.) Their co-host, the “Orange Is the New Black” actress Lea DeLaria, looked more relaxed in a navy suit and indoor sunglasses. Various Nixon aides hustled this way and that, frenzied given the approach of a midnight fund-raising deadline. "

868,"JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has long demanded that the Palestinians acknowledge his country’s existence as the “nation-state of the Jewish people.” On Thursday, his governing coalition stopped waiting around and pushed through a law that made it a fact. In an incendiary move hailed as historic by Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition but denounced by centrists and leftists as racist and anti-democratic, Israel’s Parliament enacted a law that enshrines the right of national self-determination as “unique to the Jewish people” — not all citizens. The legislation, a “basic law” — giving it the weight of a constitutional amendment — omits any mention of democracy or the principle of equality, in what critics called a betrayal of Israel’s 1948 Declaration of Independence, which ensured “complete equality of social and political rights” for “all its inhabitants” no matter their religion, race or sex. The new law promotes the development of Jewish communities, possibly aiding those who would seek to advance discriminatory land-allocation policies. And it downgrades Arabic from an official language to one with a “special status.” Since Israel was established, it has grappled with the inherent tensions between its dual aspirations of being both a Jewish and democratic state. The new law, portrayed by proponents as restoring that balance in the aftermath of judicial rulings that favored democratic values, nonetheless struck critics as an effort to tip the scales sharply toward Jewishness. Its passage demonstrated the ascendancy of ultranationalists in Israel’s government, who have been emboldened by the gains of similarly nationalist and populist movements in Europe and elsewhere, as Mr. Netanyahu has increasingly embraced illiberal democracies like that of Hungary — whose far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, arrived in Jerusalem for a friendly visit only hours before the vote.

This episode plunges us back into those lives: the recent graduate Franklin Saint (Damson Idris) struggles to keep up with the demands of his illicit small business; the C.I.A. agent Teddy McDonald (Carter Hudson) is cut off by his organization; and Lucia Villanueva (Emily Rios) crosses boundaries as the daughter of a Mexican drug lord. THE GRAND HUSTLE 10 p.m. on BET. In the recent song “Ye vs. the People,” the rapper T. I. doesn’t mince words about his distaste for President Trump. But he takes a page out of Mr. Trump’s television playbook with this “Apprentice”-like competition series based in Atlanta, in which 16 entrepreneurs compete for a six-figure salaried position at his company, Grand Hustle Records. HIDDEN on Acorn TV. “We’ve got another contender for the next ‘Broadchurch,’” Mike Hale wrote in his review for The Times about this new British police procedural. The show is set in the rolling hills of northwestern Wales and focuses on mismatched detective partners (Sian Reese-Williams and Sion Alun Davies) who work together to nab a criminal abducting young women. “‘Hidden’ practices a restraint so strong (and unusual) that you can almost feel it in your stomach,” Mr. Hale wrote; he named the show a Critic’s Pick.

870,"Before the word “resignation” became a euphemism for being fired, it connoted a sense of public integrity and personal honor. Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy, William Ruckelshaus, showed both qualities when they resigned from the Nixon administration during the Saturday Night Massacre in 1973. Jimmy Carter’s secretary of state, Cyrus Vance, did likewise when he resigned during the Iran hostage crisis in 1980. Assuming Mike Pompeo and John Bolton still have their own senses intact, they too should resign following the epic disgrace of the U.S.-Russia summit in Helsinki on Monday. So should their senior staff. I don’t suggest this lightly. I’ve known both men for years, respect them, and wrote friendly columns when they took their current jobs. I share many of their hawkish views, and have applauded some of the administration’s controversial foreign policy decisions, particularly the withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. I’m also cognizant of two factors weighing against resignation. First, cabinet members and other senior White House officials owe a president deep loyalty whatever their policy differences — the sort of loyalty George Marshall showed when he declined to resign as secretary of state despite his fierce opposition to Harry Truman’s decision to recognize Israel. Second, whoever succeeds Pompeo or Bolton could very well be worse. Secretary of State Newt Gingrich? National Security Adviser Sebastian Gorka? Why not? For an administration whose core values are personal toadyism and ethical elasticity, they’d be perfect. Yet those considerations do not relieve Pompeo, Bolton and their staff of three higher duties: the Constitution, to which they swore an oath; the country, to which they pledge allegiance; and their conscience, to which they ultimately must account. Let’s take each in its turn. "
871,"Updated, 10:38 a.m. Good morning on this sparkling Thursday. The West Coast is abuzz with electric scooters — standing scooters, like a Razor, but with a motor — and we’ve started seeing them around New York City. So what’s the deal: Are they legal here? “They are illegal and I am not aware of anything in the works to change that,” Scott Gastel, a spokesman for the city’s Transportation Department, said in an email. Violators may receive a $500 civil penalty if they are caught riding them, and their scooters may be impounded. But many New Yorkers are seemingly not concerned about getting a citation. “They are not legal, but it’s not enforced,” said Sarah Kaufman, an assistant director at the N.Y.U. Rudin Center for Transportation, whose research there has focused on scooter share markets across American cities and around the world. “Anecdotally, everyone has seen a motorized scooter on a sidewalk.” Bird and Lime are among the electric scooter start-ups leading the craze in Los Angeles and San Francisco, “but in New York City, it’s still anyone’s market,” Ms. Kaufman said. The biggest obstacle here: There’s no place for scooters, physically. “They’re too fast for the sidewalk, they’re too slow for traffic, and they’re too slow for bike lanes, so there isn’t a safe space for them,” Ms. Kaufman said. (Most can go up to 15 miles per hour.) “The focus here is on dockless bikes and electric-assist bikes because those are the speeds of New York.” "
872,"ATHENS — Russia’s foreign minister has reportedly canceled a trip to Greece, as tensions escalated between the two countries over a decision by Athens to expel two diplomats accused of trying to stoke opposition to an agreement that would clear the way for Macedonia to join NATO. The dispute over Macedonia’s name was of little interest outside the region, but it has become wrapped up in more prominent conflicts, especially after President Trump’s weeklong tour of Europe: Concern about the Kremlin’s suspected attempts to manipulate Western politics, Mr. Trump’s contradictory statements about both Russian meddling and his commitment to NATO, and Moscow’s opposition to any broadening of the Western alliance. The strains between Athens and Moscow deepened after Macedonia agreed in June to change its name to North Macedonia following negotiations with officials in Greece and on July 11 was invited to join NATO, pending final approval of the agreement. Greek officials said last week that Athens told Moscow on July 6 that it would expel two diplomats, and bar two other Russian citizens from entering the country, because of “irrefutable evidence” that Russia was trying to meddle in the Macedonia deal. The dispute sharpened on Thursday when, according to Russia’s Tass news agency, Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov canceled a trip to Athens scheduled for September. Tass quoted the Russian ambassador to Greece, Andrey Maslov, as saying the visit had become “irrelevant.” “We’ve already announced that mirror measures will be taken,” he said, apparently referring to an expected tit-for-tat expulsion of Greek officials. “I don’t know when, who and how many, but of course, in line with the existing practice, there will be countermeasures.” "
873,"A broadcasting organization backed by the federal government has used Facebook to target ads at United States citizens, in potential violation of longstanding laws meant to protect Americans from domestic propaganda. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which typically broadcasts to audiences in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, bought several ads on Facebook in recent days that were targeted at users in the United States. The ads included several human-interest stories about Russia and a graphic about NATO’s popularity. As with other state-funded media organizations, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty is mostly restricted by law from promoting its content in the United States except on request. The ads that ran on the organization’s Facebook page were uncovered by a Syracuse University researcher, Jennifer M. Grygiel, who was able to view them because of a recent policy change by Facebook. In May, the social network began displaying more information about ads on its platform, including about where the ads were targeted and the buyers. It is unclear how many people saw the advertisements, or for how long the broadcaster has been directing them to Americans. The organization, which is overseen by a person appointed during the Obama administration, said in a statement that it had purchased the ads, as well as ads in 14 other countries, to reach Facebook users who spoke specific languages. After being contacted by The New York Times, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty pulled down the ads. Nasserie Carew, a spokeswoman for the Broadcasting Board of Governors, the agency that oversees state-funded media organizations, said in a statement that Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty had “ceased the practice” of targeting ads at people in the United States after her group’s management had discussions with the broadcaster. “None of the B.B.G. networks should be distributing or promoting our content domestically in order to develop or grow domestic audiences,” Ms. Carew said. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, she said, tries to target English speakers. Some citizens in repressive countries use tools that route their internet traffic through United States servers to view foreign content, she said, which can make them appear to be Americans. But she said that the ads should not have been targeted at people in the United States. "
874,"Amid high-level turnover at the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Trump administration critics are expressing alarm over whether politics is playing a role in the recent wave of removals, reassignments and retirements. The department is currently run by Acting Secretary Peter O’Rourke and has been without a Senate-confirmed leader for months. Robert Wilkie, a former acting secretary who also served as the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness, has been nominated for the top job by President Trump. If confirmed, Mr. Wilkie would take over the second-largest department in the federal government, overseeing a 360,000-person work force. But he would be without several longtime employees who have recently left the department. The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that several unnamed current and former employees had raised alarms over what appeared to be a purge or reassignment of more than a dozen officials who were not loyal to the Trump administration. “It’s been 112 days since the V.A. had a Senate-confirmed secretary in place, and many talented people have departed leadership positions within the V.A. over the past four months,” Joe Plenzler, a spokesman for the American Legion, a veterans service organization, said in an email on Wednesday. “The Veterans Health Administration alone has more than 33,000 job vacancies representing a staffing deficit of almost 10 percent of their overall work force,” he added. “The American Legion has been sounding the alarm over this critical issue.” Representative Elizabeth Esty, a Democrat from Connecticut who serves on the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, raised concerns about the politicization of the department with Mr. O’Rourke during a hearing on Tuesday. "
875,"WASHINGTON — Anonymous evaluations of professors by their students can be caustic or catty. But they are also unfailingly candid, and collectively they paint a revealing picture of a teacher’s strengths and weaknesses. Over the last decade, about 350 law students at Harvard, Yale and Georgetown expressed views on classes offered by Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee. With rare exceptions, they praised his mastery of legal materials, intellectual rigor, fair-mindedness and accessibility. “I honestly believe I took a class that was instructed by a future Supreme Court justice,” a Georgetown student wrote in 2007. Judge Kavanaugh’s students did not hesitate to criticize the casebook he used (“the textbook is horrible!”) or to comment on personal attributes not particularly germane to his teaching (“great hair!”). Many students complained that there was too much reading. Early on, some said he was repetitive and not well organized. There was occasional griping that a few students dominated the class discussion. But on the whole, in 12 sets of evaluations spanning 700 pages, there was almost only glowing praise for Judge Kavanaugh’s teaching. More than a few students said he was the most impressive law school professor they had encountered. “Significantly better than any full-time faculty I’ve had,” a Harvard student wrote. “Kavanaugh is the best professor I have had in law school,” wrote another. “Best class I’ve taken at HLS by a mile,” said a third. "
876,"WASHINGTON — Republicans in Congress on Thursday blocked a series of measures put forward by lawmakers — largely Democratic — desperate to isolate Republican leaders and publicly rebuke President Trump over his summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia this week. In the Senate, Republicans objected to two nonbinding measures that would have put the body on record as being in support of intelligence agency conclusions that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, called on Mr. Trump to fully impose sanctions against Russia and pressed for oversight of the summit meeting, including the production of any notes taken by Americans. “If ever there was a moment to think not of just your party but for the country, this is it,” Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, implored his colleagues before his bipartisan resolution was shot down. After the White House press secretary said that Mr. Trump was not considering a Putin proposal to make a former American ambassador available to the Russian authorities for questioning, senators voted 98 to 0 in favor of a third nonbinding resolution expressing opposition to the Russian leader’s suggestion. “With this vote, the Senate has sent a message that is free from all ambiguity: Americans will not be handed over to Putin on our watch,” said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. “Those who serve our nation do not answer to the Russian president, and they have the support of a thankful nation.” "
877,"WASHINGTON — President Trump, responding to companies’ struggles with a shortage of skilled workers that has left more than six million jobs unfilled nationwide, signed an executive order Thursday geared at better aligning government training programs with the demands of industry. The order creates a Council for the American Worker, led by the secretaries of commerce and labor, that will focus on consolidating existing federal programs and funding new job training initiatives, with a special concentration on expanding apprenticeship programs and retraining older workers without college degrees. As part of the effort, companies and trade unions have committed to funding nearly four million slots for apprenticeships, retraining and continuing education programs over the next five years. Job training has emerged as one of the few coordinated policy initiatives generated in the West Wing with broad appeal across income and party lines. In part, that is because many labor and corporate leaders are struggling to expand their work force, and several top White House officials, including Kevin Hassett, the chairman of Mr. Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, have made the issue a top priority. In the run-up to Thursday’s announcement, R. Alexander Acosta, the labor secretary, announced $150 million in funding pegged to a June 2017 executive order that was intended to strengthen apprenticeship programs targeting new industries, veterans and their spouses, women, people of color, and ex-offenders. “It isn’t as massive as I’d like to see, but there is a lot of activity going on now at the federal and state levels on apprenticeships and worker training,” said Bob Lerman, a fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute who studies apprenticeship programs. “It’s all helpful, even if I’d like to see something that is a little better coordinated.” "
878,"The European Union’s decision to fine Google $5.1 billion for abusing its dominance in the smartphone business unearthed some dubious corporate practices, but the penalty and an order for Google to change its practices are, regrettably, unlikely to make the technology industry more competitive. After a yearslong investigation, Europe’s top antitrust official, Margrethe Vestager, on Wednesday said that Google had unfairly exploited its market power by imposing restrictions on manufacturers like Samsung that use the company’s Android software on their smartphones. This case is important because about 80 percent of smartphones sold in Europe and globally run on Android, and Google is by far the largest player in internet search. The company is also the biggest player in online advertising, with a nearly 40 percent market share last year, and it has a commanding presence in a number of other internet businesses, like video, email and maps. The European Union had three main complaints: Google required cellphone companies that wanted to offer its Play app store or search to preinstall 11 of its apps as a bundle, whether they wanted all of them or not. The company gave the largest manufacturers money if the only search they installed was Google’s. And the company prohibited manufacturers from developing phones on altered versions of Android not approved by Google if they wanted to use any of its other services. The company strongly disputed the allegation that its practices are anticompetitive, arguing that they are designed to help recoup Google’s investment in Android, which it licenses free to device manufacturers. Google, which plans to appeal the decision, asserts that Android is a much more open and competitive platform than its main rival, which is used by the iPhone, in which Apple controls both the device and the software. Indeed, Android devices tend to be cheaper than iPhones because manufacturers like Samsung, Motorola and LG make competing phones. The European case is strongest when it argues against Google’s exclusionary requirements — that cellphone makers not produce devices with other versions of Android and that they install only the Google search app. Such contractual terms serve to limit consumer choices and squelch innovation by making it harder for people to discover alternatives to Google products. But the regulator is on much weaker ground when it asserts that by making its apps and services available only as a bundle, Google is hurting consumers. Smartphone companies like Samsung also preinstall apps that compete with Google’s and users can easily download software by other developers — something many people do. But the larger problem with the union’s case is that it’s unlikely to shake Google’s dominance. For starters, while a $5.1 billion fine is large in absolute terms, it’s a relative bargain for Google and its parent company, Alphabet, which had $103 billion in cash and securities warming its accounts at the end of March and had nearly $13 billion in profits last year. Even more important, billions of people around the world are already accustomed to using the company’s apps and services on their Android phones and are likely to stick to them. Even new users will most likely gravitate toward Google even if the company’s apps are not preinstalled because of the superiority of many of its products and because so many other people use them — the so-called network effect. This case highlights the importance of more proactive and thoughtful antitrust enforcement and regulation. For example, officials in Europe and the United States need to be more vigilant about blocking mergers and acquisitions that have allowed tech platforms like Google’s to become so dominant in the first place. They could also seek to impose rules to limit the use of exclusionary contracts in oligopolistic industries like technology and telecommunications to encourage more competition. "
879,"One question that has troubled Democrats for decades is freshly relevant in the Trump-McConnell era: Why do so many voters support elected officials who are determined to cut programs that those same voters rely upon? Take Kentucky, which has a median household income that ranks 45th out of the 50 states. Over the past half century, residents of Kentucky have become steadily more reliant on the federal government. In the 1970s, federal programs provided slightly under 10 percent of personal income for Kentucky residents; by 2015, money from programs ranging from welfare and Medicaid to Social Security and Medicare more than doubled to 23 percent as a share of Kentuckians’ personal income. Twenty years ago, there was only one county (out of 120) in which residents counted on the federal government for at least 40 percent of their personal income. By 2014, 28 counties were at 40 percent or higher. But as their claims on federal dollars rose, the state’s voters became increasingly conservative. In the 1990s, they began to elect hard right, anti-government politicians determined to cut the programs their constituents were coming to lean on. Suzanne Mettler, a professor of government at Cornell, describes these developments —  which can be found in states across the South, the Mountain West and the Midwest —  in her new book, “The Government-Citizen Disconnect.”   The accompanying graphic, based on Mettler’s data, documents the steady rise in government dependency among Kentucky voters as their representatives in Congress moved to the right. "
880,"A month after taking office, defending himself from news reports that his aides had repeated contacts with Russian intelligence during the campaign, President Trump called out the media on Twitter using a phrase that surprised even members of the media who had grown accustomed to regular attacks. “The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @CNN, @NBCNews and many more) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American people. SICK!” the president posted on Twitter. He soon deleted the tweet and posted a revised message that called out ABC and CBS as well. The invocation spawned a flurry of articles on the history of the use of “enemy of the people,” which may have been used against the Roman emperor Nero to denounce his rule. The phrase was adopted in Nazi Germany — “If someone wears the Jewish star, he is an enemy of the people,” Hitler’s propaganda minister wrote — and, perhaps most famously, in the Soviet Union under Stalin, when being labeled an enemy of the people amounted to a death sentence. Over the next week, the president repeated the phrase, clarifying that the label applied only to purveyors of “fake news,” not to all media outlets. “A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people, and they are — they are the enemy of the people,” Mr. Trump told the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 24. “Because they have no sources. They just make them up when there are none.” "
881,"Over the course of my career as an undercover officer in the C.I.A., I saw Russian intelligence manipulate many people. I never thought I would see the day when an American president would be one of them. The president’s failure to defend the United States intelligence community’s unanimous conclusions of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and condemn Russian covert counterinfluence campaigns and his standing idle on the world stage while a Russian dictator spouted lies confused many but should concern all Americans. By playing into Vladimir Putin’s hands, the leader of the free world actively participated in a Russian disinformation campaign that legitimized Russian denial and weakened the credibility of the United States to both our friends and foes abroad.   As a member of Congress, a coequal branch of government designed by our founders to provide checks and balances on the executive branch, I believe that lawmakers must fulfill our oversight duty as well as keep the American people informed of the current danger. Somehow many Americans have forgotten that Russia is our adversary, not our ally, and the reasons for today’s tensions go back much farther than the 2016 election. For more than a decade, Russia has meddled in elections around the world, supported brutal dictators and invaded sovereign nations — all to the detriment of United States interests. Mitt Romney had it right in 2012 when he told President Barack Obama that Russia was “without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe.” Our intelligence community has concluded with high confidence that President Putin personally ordered his security services to undertake an influence campaign aimed at undermining confidence in American democracy to sow chaos in our electoral system. Russia’s efforts to hack political organizations and state election boards are well documented, as are the Russian disinformation campaigns on social media platforms. Russia is an adversary not just of the United States but of freedom-loving people everywhere. Disinformation and chaos is a Russian art form developed during the Soviet era that Russia has now updated using modern tools. The result has been Russian disinformation spreading like a virus throughout the Western world. From elections in Britain, France and Montenegro to invasions of Georgia and Ukraine, Moscow has pursued an aggressive foreign policy aimed at spreading disorder and expanding Russian influence in states formerly under the heel of Soviet Communism. These efforts weaken our allies and strengthen those who seek to undermine the democratic order that has helped prevent another world war in Europe since 1945. "
882,"The drugmaker Merck said Thursday that it would lower prices on several drugs by 10 percent or more, but its rollback affects minor products and would not lower the cost of its top-selling, expensive cancer and diabetes products. The move follows recent announcements by Pfizer and Novartis that they would freeze price increases for the rest of the year, as the industry confronts sustained criticism from President Trump, lawmakers and the public over the rising cost of prescriptions. Merck’s action shows just how cautiously the industry is shifting strategies: It did not cut the prices of any blockbusters like the cancer treatment Keytruda or the diabetes drug Januvia. Instead, it said it would reduce by 60 percent the list price of Zepatier, a hepatitis C drug whose recent sales have dipped so low that, after paying after-the-fact rebates to insurers, the company recorded no sales in the United States for the product in the first quarter of this year. The six other products that Merck said it was discounting were drugs that had lost their patent protection and are available from other manufacturers as low-cost generics. In a statement, Merck said it was lowering the prices in an effort to reduce out-of-pocket costs for patients. It also said it would not increase the average net price — the amount after discounts are applied — of its products above the rate of inflation for the rest of the year. Major drug companies have become the target of escalating tension over prices, and the Department of Health and Human Services, now run by Alex M. Azar II, a former pharmaceutical executive, has been weighing options to make some changes. "
883,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “Say that again? Did I hear you right? O.K., that’s going to be special.” That was Dan Coats, the director of U.S. national intelligence, being blindsided by a reporter’s alert that President Trump was planning to invite President Vladimir Putin of Russia to the White House this fall. It was indicative of the conflicting narratives and clashing priorities of Mr. Trump and his intelligence agencies, which have been on remarkable display this week, underscoring the degree to which the president picks and chooses intelligence to suit his political purposes. For his part, Mr. Putin said that unspecified forces in the U.S. were trying to undermine the results of the talks in Helsinki, Finland, comments aimed at deepening American divisions. _____ "
884,"Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Thursday that New York City had financed the creation or preservation of more than 32,000 units of subsidized rental housing during the previous year, an annual total that outstripped those seen under Mayor Ed Koch when a crisis of decay and disinvestment prompted historic city action. The milestone is the result of significant and increasing investment by Mr. de Blasio — more than $1.6 billion in direct city subsidy over the last fiscal year — aimed at stemming a different sort of crisis: rising rents and New Yorkers struggling to afford them. It comes in the face of headwinds from Washington, in the form of a less favorable market for tax credits for affordable housing projects nationwide, and in New York City, where the cost of construction has been growing. As a result, the city has been putting more money into its housing plan to keep the numbers growing, even as the cost per unit has increased. That is largely because the cost to the city for new construction jumped considerably since last year, to as much as $200,000 per unit from as much as $165,000 per unit in the previous fiscal year, said Molly Park, the deputy commissioner for development at the city’s Housing Preservation and Development Department. The city also revamped its housing plan last year to increase the subsidies for apartments aimed at lower-income New Yorkers, adding to the cost. The plan also grew by 50 percent: The mayor is now pledging to preserve or construct 300,000 units by 2026. At $83 billion, the total price tag for the mayor’s plan is more than double where it was when Mr. de Blasio introduced it four years ago. "
885,"The tiny Balkan nation of Montenegro, NATO’s newest member state, is suddenly in the news because of criticisms President Trump made of the alliance in a televised interview this week. During the interview, with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Mr. Trump turned his attention to Montenegro and raised questions about the United States’ commitment to the legal obligation that NATO members come to one another’s defense in the event of attack — a core commitment in the 1949 treaty that established the alliance. When Mr. Carlson asked why, hypothetically, his son should be sent to Montenegro to defend the nation if it were attacked, Mr. Trump said he had “asked the same question” and went on to say the “aggressive people” of Montenegro could potentially start World War III. (Mr. Carlson did not mention that the United States has an all-volunteer military; that there has not been a draft since 1973; or that the collective-defense clause of the treaty, known as Article 5, has been invoked only once in NATO’s history, after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.) Mr. Trump’s comments came only a week after a tense NATO summit meeting in which the president urged allies to accelerate their progress in meeting a target of spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product for military purposes. But the comments are significant in terms of the tensions between Russia and the West that are playing out in the Balkans. Here are four things to know about Montenegro that help add context to Mr. Trump’s comments. "
886,"This fall, millions of Americans may head to the polls only to find their names aren’t on voter registration lists anymore. These voters may have to cast provisional ballots. Or worse, they could be turned away. The cause? Voter purges, an often flawed method of cleaning up voter registration lists by deleting names from voter rolls. Purges aren’t necessarily a bad thing. Election officials have a real need to ensure voting lists are up-to-date. People move. People change their names. And inevitably, people die. Voter rolls should reflect those changes. But purges are a growing threat that may imperil the right to vote for millions of Americans in the midterm elections in November. In the past decade, attacks on the vote have included discriminatory voter ID laws and cutbacks in early voting that emerged from bad laws or policies formulated weeks or even months before Election Day. For the most part, we could see those attacks coming, because of public debate in state legislatures or high-profile lawsuits challenging these bad policies. "
887,"Updated July 20, 2018, with a response from the Department of Homeland Security. — Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, at the Aspen Security Forum on Thursday Ms. Nielsen’s claim contradicts an assessment from the intelligence community and was later reaffirmed by the Senate Intelligence Committee — as she knows, since her spokesman had to walk back similar comments she made in May. In a report issued on Jan. 6, 2017, two weeks before President Trump’s inauguration, the directors of the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and the N.S.A. presented him with evidence that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia directed interference in the 2016 election to benefit Mr. Trump: The assessment noted that state-owned Russian news media like RT and Sputnik made “increasingly favorable comments” about Mr. Trump, casting him as the target of unfair coverage from American media and denigrating Hillary Clinton. Furthermore, a close ally of Mr. Putin funded social media trolls, who aim to sow divisiveness to amplify negative stories about Mrs. Clinton, according to the intelligence assessment. Intelligence chiefs in Mr. Trump’s administration — including Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state and former C.I.A. director; Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence; and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the former director of the N.S.A. — have also publicly said they agree with the conclusions in the 2017 assessment. After congressional testimony in May, Ms. Nielsen told reporters that she believed Russia had tried to create confusion on both sides of the political divide in the 2016 election. Hours later, her spokesman, Tyler Q. Houlton, clarified her remarks to say that Ms. Nielsen “agrees with” the intelligence community’s assessment. Additionally,  in a May statement, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said they also have concluded that the Russian meddling was ordered by Mr. Putin and sought to help Mr. Trump and hurt Mrs. Clinton. A July follow-up report by the committee reaffirmed this finding. "
888,"WASHINGTON — The sprint by President Trump and Senate Republicans to install conservative judges to the nation’s courts hit an unexpected speed bump on Thursday after a nominee for a key federal appeals court was pulled to avoid an embarrassing defeat on the Senate floor. The nomination of Ryan W. Bounds to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit faced opposition over his writings in college, which included a column in which he railed against “race-focused groups” on campus and “race-think.” The Senate’s only black Republican, Tim Scott of South Carolina, had concerns about those writings and Mr. Bounds’s inability to clarify how his thinking had changed since then, according to a Senate Republican aide. “After talking with the nominee last night and meeting with him today, I had unanswered questions that led to me being unable to support him,” Mr. Scott said in a statement. Republican leaders have no room for error when the Democratic caucus is united in opposition, given that the party has only a 51-to-49 majority, and one Republican senator, John McCain of Arizona, has been absent while battling brain cancer. At least one other Republican, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, agreed to join Mr. Scott in opposition to Mr. Bounds’s nomination, according to another Republican aide. "
889,"The Republican National Convention will be held in Charlotte, N.C., in 2020. Proponents believe it will bring a long-lasting economic impact. In fact, political conventions have only short-term benefits for the host city. But a recent study concludes that conventions do have a very particular long-term impact on exactly one person: the host city’s mayor. The 2020 Republican convention will have one potential winner who’s not Donald Trump; her name is Vi Lyles, the mayor of Charlotte.   The study, which used data from 104 cities with populations over 160,000 from 1992 to 2012, indicates mayors who hosted political conventions were more likely to seek advancement in their careers. If their city experienced population growth and a decrease in the crime rate, and successfully hosted a mega-event — particularly a presidential nominating convention because of its headline-grabbing potency — the mayors were spurred to greater accomplishments, with about 57 percent seeking re-election, 32 retiring and 11 percent seeking another office.   When host mayors try to advance their careers, the results have been mixed. Just about 45 percent of them who sought roles beyond the mayoral office won, and nearly 7 percent of mayors seeking re-election were defeated. President Lyndon Johnson once said being a mayor was more of a burden than the presidency; many mayors sought other jobs, including, in order of frequency, governor, congressional representative, an appointment to an executive branch office or a Senate seat. Charlotte recently hosted a national convention  — for the Democrats in 2012 — and, as the study suggests,  the host mayor that year, Anthony Foxx, did reap the rewards, even if the city didn’t get a long-term economic benefit. In-party mayors, as someone like Mr. Foxx is called, have made up 58 percent of host mayors since 1992. Not long after President Barack Obama was nominated to four more years in Charlotte, Mr. Foxx packed his bags for Washington to become the secretary of the Department of Transportation. When a host mayor moves on, they often leave their city a changed place. For instance, Mr. Foxx bequeathed Charlotte a $50 million federal grant in place for police officers and militarized equipment to accommodate the convention, including a $4 million command center at the city’s Police Department headquarters and military-grade weapons. These resources were and still are in use, often against Charlotte’s citizens. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department was even proud that this was the lasting impression from the D.N.C. "
890,"WASHINGTON — President Trump plans to invite President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to visit Washington in the fall, the White House said Thursday — an invitation that stunned the nation’s top intelligence official, who said he was still groping for details of what the two leaders had discussed in their encounter this week in Helsinki, Finland. “Say that again,” the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, replied when Andrea Mitchell of NBC broke the news while interviewing him at a security conference in Aspen, Colo. “O.K.,” Mr. Coats said, taking a deep breath and chuckling awkwardly. “That’s going to be special.” The announcement came as the White House spent a third day trying to explain statements made by Mr. Trump after the Helsinki meeting, and as uncertainty spread throughout the government about whether he had reached agreements with Mr. Putin on Syria and Ukraine, leaving his military and diplomatic corps in the dark. Yielding to intense criticism, Mr. Trump rejected a proposal by Mr. Putin for Russia to question American citizens, including a former ambassador to Moscow, Michael A. McFaul, in return for giving the United States access to 12 Russian military intelligence officers indicted on charges of trying to sabotage the 2016 presidential election. Two hours after the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, issued that reversal, she said on Twitter that Mr. Trump had asked his national security adviser, John R. Bolton, to invite Mr. Putin, framing the decision as part of a dialogue that began in Helsinki and would continue at lower levels until the Russian president comes to Washington. Beyond saying the meeting would be in the fall, the White House did not announce a date. That means Mr. Trump could meet Mr. Putin again before the midterm elections, giving him a chance to redress the widespread criticism of how he handled the first meeting and possibly injecting further volatility into the campaigns. "
891,"WASHINGTON — As the Trump administration continues to deal with the fallout of the president’s conflicting statements this week about Russian electoral interference, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday focused attention on another issue involving Russia, saying that the United States hoped to advance religious freedom in that country. But he did not raise specific concerns about religious repression in Russia or suggest remedies that the United States might be seeking. “We are hopeful that the engagement that the president had with President Putin puts us in a direction where the conversations we can have with the Russians begin to turn this in the right direction,” Mr. Pompeo said, referring to President Trump’s meetings with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Monday. “That was the president’s objective in going to Helsinki, and I am confident that we achieved that.” Mr. Pompeo was speaking to a small group of reporters ahead of the State Department’s three-day summit next week on religious freedom. He said the United States believes that “religious intolerance is unacceptable” and aims to promote religious freedom in every country, whether or not it is an ally. To bolster his contention that the United States takes the issue seriously, Mr. Pompeo pointed to use of the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law that the United States has invoked to impose sanctions on human rights violators in Russia. The Kremlin deeply dislikes the law and wants it overturned. Asked if he was concerned about Russian attempts to infiltrate American religious groups, including the National Prayer Breakfast — which was attended in 2016 and 2017 by Maria Butina, a Russian accused by federal prosecutors this week of working as a covert agent — Mr. Pompeo said the United States is “concerned any time any country attempts to interfere with religious freedom of any individual.” “This administration has been incredibly strong with respect to pushing back against Russian bad behavior across its broad range of bad behaviors,” he said. "
892,"WASHINGTON — President Trump criticized the Federal Reserve on Thursday for raising interest rates, a rare rebuke by a sitting president that upends longstanding White House protocol to avoid commenting on monetary policy. Mr. Trump, in an interview with CNBC set to air on Friday morning, said that he was “not thrilled” about the Fed’s decision to raise interest rates twice so far this year, to a current range of 1.75 to 2 percent. He implied that the moves, which are aimed at getting interest rates back to historically normal levels, could derail his administration’s efforts to bolster the economy and put the United States at a disadvantage. “I don’t like all of this work that we’re putting into the economy and then I see rates going up,” Mr. Trump said, according to excerpts released by CNBC. “I am not happy about it.” The highly unusual comments come as Mr. Trump and Republicans try to make a booming economy a big issue in the midterm elections this year. At a White House event on Thursday, Mr. Trump — flanked by executives from some of the biggest companies in the country — announced a worker retraining program that he said would further goose employment. On Capitol Hill, Republican lawmakers are trying to pass a second round of tax cuts that would make permanent many of the individual cuts in last year’s $1.5 trillion package. But as the economy finally gains steam after years of sluggish growth in the wake of the Great Recession, the Fed is facing a delicate political and economic balance. Unemployment is at an 18-year low. Inflation is running above the Fed’s 2 percent target. Gross domestic product growth could hit 3 percent this year, which would be the best rate in more than a decade, and growth for the second quarter is estimated to be as high as 5 percent when the numbers are released on Friday morning. If the Fed raises rates too quickly, it risks slowing growth at a time when wages have stagnated for most American workers, after accounting for inflation. But if it raises rates too slowly, some Fed officials fear the economy could “overheat” and ignite a rapid spiral of price increases that could eventually prompt a recession. Historically, presidents have preferred lower rates, because faster economic growth typically helps incumbents win re-election. "
893,"The Interior Department on Thursday proposed the most sweeping set of changes in decades to the Endangered Species Act, the law that brought the bald eagle and the Yellowstone grizzly bear back from the edge of extinction but which Republicans say is cumbersome and restricts economic development. The proposed revisions have far-reaching implications, potentially making it easier for roads, pipelines and other construction projects to gain approvals than under current rules. One change, for instance, would eliminate longstanding language that prohibits considering economic factors when deciding whether or not a species should be protected. The agency also intends to make it more difficult to shield species like the Atlantic sturgeon that are considered “threatened,” which is the category one level beneath the most serious one, “endangered.” Battles over endangered species have consumed vast swaths of the West for decades, and confrontations over protections for the spotted owl, the sage grouse and the gray wolf have shaped politics and public debate. While the changes proposed Thursday by the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service wouldn’t be retroactive, they could set the stage for new clashes over offshore drilling and also could help smooth the path for  projects like oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. David L. Bernhardt, the deputy secretary of the Interior Department, said that the 1973 law had not seen major changes in 30 years and described the proposals as streamlining and improving the regulatory process. He rejected a suggestion that the moves would help the oil and gas businesses, although leaders in those industries have long sought similar changes to the ones outlined Thursday. “Together these rules will be very protective and enhance the conservation of the species,” Mr. Bernhardt said. “At the same time we hope that they ameliorate some of the unnecessary burden, conflict and uncertainty that is within our current regulatory structure.” "
894,"After audio surfaced of Representative Jason Lewis, a swing district Republican from Minnesota, making misogynistic remarks on his former radio program, his Democratic opponent in November’s midterm elections is saying Mr. Lewis’s rhetoric proves he is too extreme to represent the ideologically diverse district. Angie Craig, a former journalist and health care manufacturing executive who is challenging Mr. Lewis in one of the most competitive districts in the country, said in an interview that “comments like this don’t represent Minnesota values.” Mr. Lewis’s remarks were first reported Wednesday by CNN, which unearthed audio recordings of a radio show he hosted from 2009 to 2014. In several instances, according to the recordings, he implied that women who voted for Democrats proved the stereotype that the female gender is more governed by emotion than reason. He also said that women who vote based on issues like birth control “have no cognitive function whatsoever” and lamented that certain women can no longer be publicly called derogatory terms like “sluts.” “It used to be that women were held to a little bit of a higher standard,” Mr. Lewis said in 2012. “We required modesty from women. Now, are we beyond those days where a woman can behave as a slut, but you can’t call her a slut?” In December 2012, Mr. Lewis said, “Only we can tell our young women, ‘Don’t look like some slut and you won’t get hit on.’” "
895,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A surprise invitation, a new definition of Israel and a changed policy from Facebook. Here’s what you need to know: • “Say that again? Did I hear you right? O.K., that’s going to be special.” That was Dan Coats, the director of U.S. national intelligence, being blindsided by a reporter’s alert that President Trump was planning to invite President Vladimir Putin of Russia to the White House this fall. It was indicative of the conflicting narratives and clashing priorities of Mr. Trump and his intelligence agencies, which has been on remarkable display this week, underscoring the degree to which the president picks and chooses intelligence to suit his political purposes. For his part, Mr. Putin said that unspecified forces in the U.S. were trying to undermine the results of the talks in Helsinki, Finland, comments aimed at deepening American divisions. _____ • Israel’s Parliament narrowly passed a contentious basic law that enshrines it as the Jewish-nation state. The legislation downgrades the status of the Arabic language, promotes Jewish construction and affirms the exclusive right of Jews to self-determination. "
896,"The Environmental Protection Agency’s failure to intervene earlier and stop the water crisis in Flint, Mich., exposed a need for wholesale changes to how federal officials monitor drinking water systems, a government watchdog said Thursday. A report from the E.P.A.’s Office of Inspector General said management weaknesses hobbled the agency’s response to the lead and other contaminants that poisoned Flint’s drinking water for more than a year and that federal officials should have taken stronger action to correct repeated blunders by state regulators. “While Flint residents were being exposed to lead in drinking water, the federal response was delayed, in part, because the E.P.A. did not establish clear roles and responsibilities, risk-assessment procedures, effective communication and proactive oversight tools,” the 74-page report said. The inspector general called for the E.P.A. to check on states annually to make sure they are complying with federal lead and copper rules, to pay special attention to state regulators in Michigan, and to improve the federal response to water contamination emergencies. E.P.A. officials said they accepted the recommendations, though some Democrats said they remained skeptical that stricter monitoring would occur under the Trump administration. “You actually have to get out there and do the oversight,” said Representative Dan Kildee, a Democrat who represents the Flint area. “It has to be much more aggressive.” "
897,"To the Editor: Re “A Victory Is Declared on the War on Poverty” (news article, July 13): The fact that President Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers declared “that America’s long-running war on poverty ‘is largely over and a success’” can mean only two things: Either those top officials are totally disconnected from the reality on the ground, or they are willfully misrepresenting the actual situation in order to find ways to reduce the government’s responsibility to help those most in need in our society. My strong suspicion is that it is the latter. By supporting the latest tax giveaway to the wealthy and the big corporations, they manage to create huge budget deficits that will justify shredding the safety net for the poor. What better pretext could they use than to claim that the poverty problem no longer exists and therefore the poor can be left to their own devices to help themselves? MARTIN KARCHER, WASHINGTON The writer, an economist, is a former division chief, Population and Human Resources Project, at the World Bank. "
898,"Iran’s central banker was fired on Wednesday in the first senior shake-up since the United States abandoned the nuclear agreement nearly three months ago and restored sanctions, moves that worsened an already weak Iranian economy. The dismissed official, Valiollah Seif, governor of the central bank for five years, had been widely assailed for what critics called his mismanagement of Iran’s monetary policy, which contributed to a steep drop in the value of the country’s rial currency. Some also faulted Mr. Seif for failing to foresee that the Trump administration would withdraw from the nuclear agreement, which had eased economic sanctions in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear work. President Trump’s decision, announced in May, accelerated a capital flight from Iran that hastened the rial’s decline, unnerving Iranians who saw it as a warning of economic calamity. Mr. Seif may have been further impaired by the Trump administration’s decision, after reimposing sanctions, to blacklist him for what it called his role in money transfers to Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant organization that the United States regards as a terrorist group. The blacklisting made it difficult for international bankers to deal with Mr. Seif without risking American penalties. His departure, announced in Iran’s state-run media, made Mr. Seif the first top official in President Hassan Rouhani’s government to fall since the nuclear agreement began to unravel. Analysts expect more dismissals because of the tough new economic reality facing the nation of 80 million, where inflation and unemployment are on the rise. "
899,"This Thursday the Trump administration faces a deadline handed down earlier this summer by a United States District Court judge: reunite the children separated from their parents at the border by federal law enforcement. There’s no way the White House will pull it off. Reports indicate that hundreds of parents will not be seeing their children because the government can’t locate the parents or has already deported them. This entire catastrophe isn’t just the result of a deliberately cruel and incompetently implemented policy, though it is certainly that. These sundered families are the latest casualty of “zero tolerance” — a misguided mind-set that bludgeons the people it targets, no matter how vulnerable. For a generation, American policymakers have been addicted to zero tolerance as a response to all social ills: crime, drugs, sexual violations — even misbehaving schoolchildren. Start with crime. In the 1980s and 1990s, federal and state governments went on a criminal justice binge, vastly expanding our criminal codes, especially in the “wars” against crime and drugs and deploying zero-tolerance policing. The result is that some 70 million Americans have a criminal record — a number equal to Americans with a college degree, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. We remain the nation that “incarcerates a larger share of its population than any other,” according to a recent Pew Research Center report. This despite the fact that crime in the United States is at a modern low. But zero tolerance wasn’t just part of the criminal justice system. Under federal mandate, it became entrenched in schools. Among those caught was a 14-year-old girl in Ohio who, in 1996, gave a Midol tablet to a friend for her menstrual cramps. Administrators at her public junior high school found out, and the girl who supplied the Midol was suspended as a drug dealer.   She was black, and the family brought a suit claiming racial discrimination. They ultimately won, but those who have tracked the implementation and consequences of zero-tolerance policies have documented how black and brown people are disproportionately punished by them. "
900,"SAN FRANCISCO — Qualcomm called off its $44 billion deal to buy NXP Semiconductors after Chinese regulators did not rule on the transaction amid a trade war between Washington and Beijing. The company had already cautioned that the deal was likely to be scrapped, assuming no last-minute approval by Chinese authorities came by a midnight deadline. Both NXP and Qualcomm formally announced the termination on Thursday. NXP said it would receive a $2 billion termination fee from Qualcomm as a result, while Qualcomm said it would buy back up to $30 billion of its stock. The transaction failed after a series of trade moves by the Trump administration, including tariffs on numerous Chinese goods, and retaliatory measures from China. Trade experts had said China appeared to be withholding approval of the Qualcomm deal to gain negotiating leverage. Eight other jurisdictions, including the United States, had already approved Qualcomm’s purchase of the Dutch chip maker. China was the exception, dragging the review process out to more than 20 months. The developments followed actions by President Trump to aid Qualcomm earlier this year. In March, he blocked a $117 billion hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm by a rival chip maker, Broadcom, after a federal committee said an acquisition would reduce research spending on wireless technology essential to national security. "
901,"WASHINGTON — The United States and the European Union stepped back from the brink of a trade war on Wednesday, after President Trump said the Europeans agreed to work toward lower tariffs and other trade barriers, and to buy billions of dollars of American soybeans and natural gas. The surprise announcement, made by Mr. Trump and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, defused, for the moment, a trade battle that began with Mr. Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum exports and threatened to escalate to automobiles. “We’re starting the negotiation right now, but we know very much where it’s going,” Mr. Trump said, standing next to Mr. Juncker at a hastily scheduled appearance in the White House Rose Garden. Mr. Juncker said, “I had the intention to make a deal today, and we have made a deal today.” The two sides, he said, had agreed to hold off on further tariffs, and work toward dropping the existing ones on steel and aluminum, while they tried to work out a deal to eliminate tariffs, nontariff barriers and subsidies on industrial goods, excluding autos. It was hard to say, given Mr. Trump’s bluster and unpredictable negotiating style, if the agreement was a genuine truce or merely a lull in a conflict that could flare up again. Twice, Mr. Trump’s aides have negotiated potential deals with China, only to have him reject them and impose further tariffs. Cutting these trade barriers to zero would be an extraordinarily complex political challenge on both sides of the Atlantic. And Mr. Trump stepped back from punitive tariff threats for some relatively minor European concessions: the purchase of soybeans to make up for a steep falloff of buying by China, and the promise to purchase liquefied natural gas once the United States builds more export terminals, which are far away. For weeks, the president has portrayed the European Union as fleecing America with unfair trade, but he put away his saber as farm state Republicans were begging for relief. "
902,"SAN FRANCISCO — For nearly two years, Facebook has appeared bulletproof despite a series of scandals about the misuse of its giant social network. But the Silicon Valley company’s streak ended on Wednesday when it said that the accumulation of issues was starting to hurt its multibillion-dollar business — and that the costs are set to continue playing out for months. Facebook reported on Wednesday that growth in digital advertising sales and in the number of its users had decelerated in the second quarter. The company’s leaders, including its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, added that the trajectory was not likely to improve anytime soon, especially as Facebook spends to improve the privacy and security of users. Facebook has grappled with months of scrutiny over Russian misuse of the platform in the 2016 American presidential campaign and the harvesting of its users’ data through the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The results were among the first signs that the issues had pierced the company’s image and would have a lasting effect on its moneymaking machine. In response, Facebook’s stock tumbled more than 23 percent in after-hours trading, erasing more than $120 billion in market value in less than two hours. If those losses hold up through regular trading on Thursday, the one-day stock decline will be the biggest in Facebook’s history. “This is a fork-in-the-road situation for Facebook,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research for GBH Insights, a marketing research firm. He said the challenges included regaining public trust as well as increasing the number of people joining Facebook and the time they spent on the platform. "
903,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The trade war with the European Union appears to be off, at least for now. At a surprise news conference, President Trump and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said they would work toward lowering tariffs and other trade barriers. Details of the agreement were scant but hinted at collaboration against Chinese trade practices. At the same time, a very different story was unfurling. The release of a secret recording Tuesday night by Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, has unraveled some of the false statements the president has used as a shield against tough questions and embarrassing stories. _____ 2. The news from Washington took some other interesting twists, in a fairly compressed time frame. While President Trump was announcing a trade truce with the E.U., Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pressed President Trump’s case that, despite his conciliatory appearance last week with Vladimir Putin, Mr. Trump was being tough on Russia. "
904,"The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees will cut more than 260 jobs and curtail mental health services and mobile health clinics, it announced on Wednesday, the first reduction since the United States suspended tens of millions of dollars in funding this year. “These cuts are unprecedented in their scope and depth and their consequences are likely to be dramatic, widespread and unpredictable,” Christopher Gunness, the agency’s spokesman, said in an email. The cuts are the first outcome of a significant American reduction in contributions to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or Unrwa. The Trump administration has provided about $60 million this year. That reflects a drop of more than 80 percent from the $360 million the United States contributed in 2017. Historically, the United States has been one of the biggest donors to Unrwa, which provides food, education, health services and employment to many Palestinians classified as refugees in Gaza, East Jerusalem, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. The agency said its food assistance program would remain in place until the end of the year, but Mr. Gunness said he feared that agency-run schools would not open on time, in August, because of funding shortages. “We may have over half a million kids on the streets of the Middle East — more than half of them in Gaza — rather than in U.N. schools,” he said. “Whose interests does that serve?” The job cuts are spread out between the West Bank and Gaza. The agency said it would not renew the contracts of 154 workers in the West Bank and 113 in Gaza. In addition, 584 other workers will shift to part-time jobs. Trump administration officials have said any restoration of aid will be partly dependent on what they consider improvements in the agency’s efficiency and accountability. They also said other countries should share more of the financial burden. Critics of the funding cut have asserted that the United States was retaliating against Palestinians for their angry responses to its decisions favoring Israel in the protracted Israeli-Palestinian dispute, notably the recognition in December of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Pierre Krähenbühl, the commissioner general of Unrwa, said in a June interview with The New York Times that the funding cut had put the agency in its worst financial situation since its creation in 1949, a year after Israel was founded, and could disrupt vital services. In response to the cuts, the agency initiated a fund-raising campaign that collected $238 million between March and June. "
905,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A secret Trump recording, violence at Pakistan’s polls and a flag fracas for Australia. Here’s what you need to know: • A betrayal or “a new path”? President Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, released a secret recording in which Mr. Trump appears to have direct knowledge about hush money paid to a former Playboy model who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. Here’s how the audio clip has unraveled a web of false statements by Mr. Trump and his aides. Mr. Trump reacted at once: “What kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad!” But Mr. Cohen’s lawyer said that his client is “on a new path — it’s a reset button to tell the truth and to let the chips fall where they may.” Separately, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended Mr. Trump before Congress, saying he had “proof” that the president is willing to confront Moscow for its interference in American elections and misbehavior around the world. The White House, meanwhile, said a planned follow-up meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia will be postponed until after the investigation of the special counsel is concluded. _____ "
906,"Beware of oil companies bearing gifts. Recently, the lobbyists and former Senators Trent Lott and John Breaux, backed by companies like Exxon Mobil and Shell, have been campaigning for a federal tax on carbon dioxide emissions. This would increase energy costs, but all revenue from the tax would be returned to the public. A family of four might receive a $2,000 check from the government every year. And we would all have an incentive to reduce our use of carbon-based fossil fuels in favor of clean energy. Most environmentalists, including us, desperately want a meaningful tax on carbon. But several of the people involved in this proposal have shown little previous interest in climate change. The oil industry had few better friends than Mr. Lott, a Republican from Mississippi, and Mr. Breaux, a Democrat from Louisiana, when they were in office. So what is going on here? Well, Mr. Lott and Mr. Breaux aren’t simply proposing a tax, but a deal: a carbon tax in exchange for two other things. First, they want “an outright repeal of the Clean Power Plan,” which allows the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate carbon emissions and which the Trump administration is moving to cancel. Second — and most consequentially — they want to give fossil fuel companies immunity from lawsuits seeking to hold them accountable for damage they have done to the climate. As their proposal puts it, “Robust carbon taxes would also make possible an end to federal and state tort liability for emitters.” Not coincidentally at all, 14 local and county governments and the State of Rhode Island filed such lawsuits in the last year, trying to make big oil companies pay their fair share for climate adaptations — the fortifications against the consequences, for instance, of rising seas, extreme weather and prolonged droughts. (The Rockefeller Family Fund has funded organizations that support the goals of these lawsuits.) Making the polluter pay is a bedrock environmental principle and a matter of simple justice. If the companies most responsible for climate change can escape liability, then ordinary citizens will have to shoulder the burden of adapting to the changing climate, which over the next few decades will cost this country trillions of dollars. What Big Oil really fears, much more than a modest price on carbon, and what it is trying to escape through the proposed deal, is having to pay for its own actions. Climate science has made major advancements recently and can now demonstrate quite precisely the extent to which human-caused climate change is responsible for extreme weather. Peer-reviewed science can also show what percentage of greenhouse gas pollution any particular company has emitted since the Industrial Revolution. "
907,"Sean Spicer has written a book. And to promote it in interview after interview, he seems willing to relive his darkest moments as White House press secretary. A National Public Radio host grilled him last week about President Trump’s inauguration crowd, yet again. A BBC anchor told him Monday that he had “corrupted discourse for the entire world.” Fox News was gentler, asking his mother what it was like to raise “this amazing child.” (“Oh come on,” she replied, with a laugh.) “Some interviews are obviously more enjoyable than others,” Mr. Spicer told The New York Times in a phone interview on Wednesday. The confrontational BBC interview in particular has been shared with relish by his critics online, with some journalists calling the exchange “brutal” and “savage.” Emily Maitlis, the BBC anchor of “Newsnight,” grilled Mr. Spicer on his infamous first briefing, in which he falsely said that Mr. Trump’s swearing-in a day earlier had drawn the “largest audience to ever witness an inauguration.” Ms. Maitlis called the news conference the start of a “corrosive culture” in the United States and beyond and said Mr. Spicer had corrupted the political conversation “by going along with these lies.” "
908,"Facts don’t matter to millions of Americans anymore. That is just the truth. Republicans bewitched by Donald Trump have devalued the import of truth. It is a sad truth and a dangerous one. What is the operational framework of a society when the truth ceases to be accepted as true? There may be precedents in other countries, but one would be hard pressed to find a precedent here. It is becoming cliché now to say that we are in uncharted territory with Trump and his regime, but that is precisely where we are. There is tremendous possibility for peril, but luckily for Trump and the country, we have so far avoided all-out catastrophe. There is no guarantee that our lucky streak will be extended. Every day there is no catastrophe, every day yet another never-before-seen, outrageous scandal emerges from this administration and Trump is not destroyed by it, it strengthens him and numbs us and steels his supporters. The more he lies without paying a price for it, the more he weakens the power of the truth to defend right and condemn wrong. And he expands his latitude to lie more. "
909,"WASHINGTON — By the end of the night, Austin Juersivich, an 18-year-old attending a conservative leadership conference for high schoolers, had nearly lost his voice. That didn’t stop him from beaming. “That tells you how much I liked it,” Mr. Juersivich, of Akron, Ohio, said with a raspy voice on Tuesday. The four-day gathering, organized by Turning Point USA for about 700 high-school-age conservatives from across the country, is being marketed as a leadership conference that gives teenagers the tools needed to network, organize and campaign while hearing from a who’s who of politics and the news media. “They’re teaching us about how to handle politics and how to live in a world where some things aren’t good to say in public and how to deal with backlash on that,” said Genna Montalbano, a rising junior from Houston. But an elegant dinner Tuesday night at Trump International Hotel featuring Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, Donald Trump Jr. and Turning Point USA’s 24-year-old founder, Charlie Kirk, revealed that more than anything, this week is a chance for the teenagers to reject the stereotype that their generation is exclusively liberal and to finally be themselves, “Make America Great Again” hats and all. “You are the only real rebels left in this country,” Mr. Trump said, to thunderous applause. For some, the conference is an opportunity to swap stories about the struggle to express their conservative opinions at school. Jarrett Wiggonton, an 18-year-old from Virginia, said that at a recent pep rally, his and his friends’ Trump signs and paraphernalia were confiscated by teachers. "
910,"Mr. Pompeo is exaggerating the Trump administration’s support for the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. While the administration “gets credit for compliance, clearly it was Congress pushing the administration’s hand” to pass the law, said Alina Polyakova, a Russia expert at the Brookings Institution. The law, which was enacted in August, imposed new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea. It also upheld earlier sanctions that President Barack Obama had enacted through executive orders and it limited President Trump’s ability to lift sanctions against Russia. The legislation passed with overwhelming support — a veto-proof majority vote of 98 to 2 in the Senate and 419 to 3 in the House. Mr. Pompeo is right that Mr. Trump eventually signed the law. But the president did so reluctantly after the White House pushed to weaken the bill. Even as he signed it into law, Mr. Trump called the bill “seriously flawed” and said that it “included a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions.” As the law requires, the administration imposed economic sanctions in March on individuals and organizations linked to Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election.  In April, American sanctions were issued against some of Russia’s richest men and top government officials. More sanctions were imposed in June on individuals and organizations accused of directly supporting efforts to carry out cyberattacks in the United States and in Ukraine as well as on digital infrastructure around the world.

912,"Lanny J. Davis’s client list, like his quintessentially Washington career as an all-purpose lawyer, lobbyist, crisis consultant and television-talker, is lengthy, international — and more than occasionally contradictory. Mr. Davis has represented Harvey Weinstein and Penn State, a Ukrainian oligarch with links to President Trump’s indicted former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and an Ivory Coast strongman whom Mr. Davis today insists he was trying to help dislodge as part of a secret arrangement with the State Department. Now, Mr. Davis — best known as a high-profile spinner for Bill and Hillary Clinton, first in the White House and then on any cable news network that would have him — has set off on perhaps his least likely partnership: He is defending Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, who released a recording this week of a conversation that suggests Mr. Trump knew about hush money payments to a former Playboy model. It was Mr. Davis who went on CNN on Tuesday evening to tell the world about their gambit. “Don’t believe me, I’m a Democrat,” Mr. Davis said, addressing “red America” as he stared into the camera. “Believe your own ears.” That strategy, those who know Mr. Davis say, is “classic Lanny,” for better or worse, a sort of valedictory turn for an avatar of the capital’s forever-booming image-buffing industry. His book’s subtitle, lifted from his time as Mr. Clinton’s special counsel and as a self-described crisis guru, advises: “Tell it early, tell it all, tell it yourself.” For Mr. Cohen, this has translated to an aggressive defense in the news media — as much reputational management as legal wrangling — responding in kind to Mr. Trump and his team where other lawyers might be inclined to lie low, with federal prosecutors watching closely. "
913,"The White House barred a CNN journalist from attending a public appearance by President Trump in the Rose Garden on Wednesday, an apparent act of retaliation that drew immediate rebuke from news organizations and signaled the latest escalation of Mr. Trump’s hostilities toward the news media. Kaitlan Collins, a White House correspondent for CNN, said she was called into the West Wing and chastised by administration officials for what they deemed “inappropriate” questions that she had asked of Mr. Trump during an Oval Office photo opportunity earlier in the day. The officials — Bill Shine, the newly appointed deputy chief of staff, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary — then informed Ms. Collins that they would not allow her to attend Mr. Trump’s public remarks with the president of the European Commission, an event that was otherwise open to the media. “They did not like the questions I asked President Trump about the news of the day,” Ms. Collins said. It is standard practice for reporters to ask questions of Mr. Trump at the end of photo ops, where the president often engages at length even as his aides try to shuffle the reporters from the scene. On Wednesday, Ms. Collins — who attended as a pool reporter, representing the major television networks — asked Mr. Trump several times if he had concerns about the loyalty of his former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, whom the president had tweeted about on Wednesday morning. "
914,"WASHINGTON — A group of House Republicans escalated their feud with the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, on Wednesday, introducing articles of impeachment in a long-shot bid to oust the official overseeing the special counsel inquiry into Russian election interference. The move was seen as much as a political maneuver as an act of congressional oversight. The group of 11, led by Representatives Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Jim Jordan of Ohio, would need the support of a majority of the House and two-thirds of the Senate to convict Mr. Rosenstein. The resolution they filed does not require the entire House to vote before Congress adjourns for its summer recess on Friday. But it could provide President Trump with more ammunition to attack Mr. Rosenstein, who has been in Mr. Trump’s cross hairs since he appointed the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to investigate Russia’s plot to manipulate the 2016 presidential election and whether any Trump associates were complicit. Republican lawmakers have been sparring with Mr. Rosenstein for months. They accuse the Justice Department of being less than forthcoming with documents related to several of its most sensitive investigations, including the Russia inquiry. “It’s time to find a new deputy attorney general who is serious about accountability and transparency,” Mr. Meadows said in a statement on Wednesday. "
915,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s confrontation with China is beginning to ripple through American academic and research institutions, as a crackdown on visas for certain Chinese citizens has left the higher education community wondering how it will adapt to the administration’s effort to stop intellectual property theft and slow China’s push for technological supremacy. Educators and academic groups fear that the additional scrutiny could hinder scientific innovation, alienate talented applicants or intensify aggressions toward Chinese scientists already in the country. Academics are already wrestling with the increased attention. At an aerospace conference in Georgia last month, Ella Atkins, a University of Michigan professor, recalled a colleague approaching her with a dilemma. The colleague, an assistant professor at another university, had recently led and submitted a research proposal for a federal grant. But he worried that because he was Chinese, the judges would be biased against his team. “He said, ‘I need to figure out how to take myself off as the P.I., the principal investigator, if that’s going to compromise our project’s chances of being accepted,’” Ms. Atkins said, declining to name the academic for fear of jeopardizing his proposal. The professor, she added, was even considering withdrawing from the project completely to avoid holding back his co-researchers. It is a sentiment that some, such as Representative Judy Chu, Democrat of California, believe underscores a tone of racism behind the policy change. The restrictions, she said, equate to targeting “an entire ethnic group of people for suspicion that they’re spies for China.” "
916,"The Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, no stranger to speaking his mind and creating controversy, on Wednesday added fuel to an already confusing and rancorous debate about how the N.F.L. plans to handle players who demonstrate during the playing of the national anthem this season. At the opening of the Cowboys’ training camp in Oxnard, Calif., Jones said that all his team’s players would be required to stand on the field for the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner.” They would not be able to stay in the team’s locker room, something allowed under the league’s revised policy on the anthem. “Our policy is you stand during the anthem, toe the line,” Jones told reporters. Jones added that President Trump’s tweets criticizing the league’s handling of the players who protest had been “problematic” for the N.F.L. Jones’s comments came as the league and N.F.L. Players Association continue to discuss how to revise the anthem policy yet again. A number of players have chosen to kneel or raise a fist during the playing of the anthem, to draw attention to racism and police brutality. In May, the owners unilaterally said that players would be obligated to stand on the field for the national anthem but would have the option of staying indoors. The league reserved the right to fine teams whose players protest on the field during the anthem, while the teams, in turn, can penalize those players. Previously, players were obligated to be on the field during the anthem, but only encouraged, not forced, to stand while the song was being played. "
917,"An American pastor held on espionage charges in Turkey, the focus of an intensive campaign by top United States officials seeking his freedom, was moved from jail to house arrest on Wednesday because of health concerns. Andrew Brunson, a 50-year-old evangelical pastor from North Carolina, has been held for more than a year and a half in a case that has aggravated already tense relations between Turkey and the United States, longtime allies. He is one of 20 Americans who were charged after a failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 2016. President Trump spoke to Mr. Erdogan by phone about the case, and posted a message on Twitter last week urging the Turkish leader to “do something” to free the pastor. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also took to Twitter to say that while the United States welcomed the “long overdue news that Pastor Brunson has been moved from prison to house arrest,” the measure was “not enough.” “We have seen no credible evidence against Mr. Brunson, and call on Turkish authorities to resolve his case immediately in a transparent and fair manner,” Mr. Pompeo wrote. Just last week, a court in Turkey’s western Izmir Province upheld an earlier decision to place Mr. Brunson in jail while he awaited the continuation of a trial on charges of terrorism and espionage. His lawyer appealed the decision, citing unspecified concerns over Mr. Brunson’s health, according to the semiofficial Anadolu news agency. "
918,"The economy may be humming, but for American car companies, the year is looking less bright. All of Detroit’s Big 3 automakers issued downward revisions on Wednesday in their financial forecasts for the year, with each highlighting rising commodities costs that stem in part from the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The adjustments, made as the companies announced their second-quarter earnings, sent their shares down sharply. Ford Motor recorded the worst showing of the three, as net income fell by nearly half to $1.1 billion from the same period ago. Aside from higher materials costs, Ford is struggling in Europe, South America and especially China, where it has spent heavily in recent years to expand but made just $3 million in the quarter and has watched its sales fall. “The deterioration in this important global market has been swift,” Jim Farley, Ford executive vice president and president of global markets, said in a conference call. He said Ford’s joint ventures in China suffered from uncompetitive costs, weak dealer networks and a shortage of sport-utility vehicles in its model line. Ford is now “taking urgent action,” although its troubles will linger, he said. Casting a further cloud over the company was news it was postponing a daylong meeting with analysts scheduled for September, when Ford was supposed to detail the turnaround plan of its chief executive, Jim Hackett. Mr. Hackett was hired in May 2017 to reinvigorate Ford, but the lack of details on Ford’s plans have frustrated some analysts. “The postponement of the capital markets day is a pretty big deal, Jim,” Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley said on the call. In an unusually blunt question, he then wondered about Mr. Hackett’s future with Ford. “Will you be the one delivering the message or will someone else be doing it?” Mr. Jonas asked. After replying at some length about the progress he felt the company had made, Mr. Hackett concluded by saying: “And hell, yes, I expect to be in front of everybody declaring where we’re going and what we want to get done. So I think there should be zero question about that.” "
919,"WASHINGTON — The White House said on Wednesday that President Trump wants to delay a planned follow-up meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia until after the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is concluded — which the White House predicted would be next year. “The president believes that the next bilateral meeting with President Putin should take place after the Russia witch hunt is over, so we’ve agreed that it will be after the first of the year,” Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, said in a statement. Last week, Mr. Trump unexpectedly said he would invite Mr. Putin to Washington in the fall — a move that some interpreted as a show of defiance by Mr. Trump after a storm of criticism over his meeting with Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland. Mr. Trump directed Mr. Bolton to deliver the invitation. But the Kremlin had not yet accepted the invitation, raising questions about whether Mr. Putin was interested. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday in Moscow, Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin aide, acknowledged receiving the invitation but declined to say whether Mr. Putin would visit Washington this year. Mr. Ushakov said that the leaders had not discussed the future meeting while in Helsinki, but that Mr. Bolton had later conveyed the invitation to Russian officials. Mr. Ushakov said Russian and American officials had reached “an understanding that a meeting must take place,” but that “practical aspects will be discussed later.” He said that Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin would, in any case, have an opportunity to meet at a Group of 20 gathering in November in Argentina, and that “maybe there will be other international events which Trump and Putin will take part in.” "

mran Mohammad survived on Manus Island through sheer discipline. He got up every morning at dawn to run, cooked for large groups at night and in between he wrote a 1,200-page autobiography, by hand, in English. But the experience of Australia’s offshore detention center — where he was held despite his status as a Rohingya refugee from Myanmar — also nearly broke him. When I first met him in Manus, he whispered in public spaces, his eyes ever-darting, as if trying to hide from threats unseen. When we said goodbye, I remember thinking: If this guy ever gets out, he’s going to succeed wildly, or he’s going to be crushed by modern life. Now he is in the United States — and I’m still not sure which way he’s heading. We met in New York last week. He’d been resettled in Chicago a few weeks earlier, and he was traveling with another Rohingya refugee from Manus and an Australian couple from Queensland who flew to the United States to see them after years of long-distance support. As a foursome, they were a case study in hope and trauma. Imran looked physically stronger. He told me his life in the United States, as part of the refugee resettlement deal first brokered by President Barack Obama, started with elation. "

President Trump’s tariffs have provoked retaliatory levies on American pork, beef, soybeans and sorghum. It’s only a “short-term solution,” according to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. It still faces criticism. Farmers would rather sell goods than receive handouts. And if the World Trade Organization decides it’s an unfair subsidy, it could open the way to yet more retaliation. Then, as the editorial board of the NYT argues, there are the other candidates for trade aid: Elsewhere in trade: Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, will offer Mr. Trump ideas for easing tensions today (it could be a sticky meeting). Many U.S. manufacturers are taking tariffs in their stride (Apple may become an exception). The trade war could dampen Chinese enthusiasm for U.S. oil. And here’s how to spot if tariffs damage the economy. The Main Street Investors Coalition says it represents retail investors with no voice in corporate America. But it’s trying to reduce the influence of pension funds and large 401(k) plans, where most little guys keep their money.

But this coalition knows full well that individual investors rarely mount proxy contests, so its plans would probably leave boards and managers more secure.

922,"So the Ivanka Trump brand is over: kaput, shutting down, soon to be no more. Really? Don’t be silly. The Ivanka Trump brand is alive and well and working in the West Wing as a special adviser to President Trump. It’s the Ivanka Trump fashion line that is closing, as announced on Tuesday by the first daughter. The one was only ever a shadow expression of the other — or rather, a homage of sorts to what she liked to wear. Which was exactly the problem. The company was based on the premise that there was a group of women who would want to buy, with hard dollars and cents, the image Ms. Trump herself was selling to the world. The one she disseminated so relentlessly via guest appearances on her father’s television show and stories in Vogue and books and on her own Instagram page: Herself as the glassy blond embodiment of the woman who had it all — a big job, family, a perfect blow out, time to exercise. The promise for sale was that you could try this image on with the ease of slipping on a power sheath dress. It’s the promise of every celebrity- or personality-driven fashion line. It’s why Uniqlo was willing to pay so much for Roger Federer to become a brand ambassador; why Coach wanted to team up with Selena Gomez. Why so many actors and athletes now see their next career step as clothing, and why so many are willing to back them in that move. It’s not about aesthetic vision or achievement. Certainly, Ms. Trump’s clothing and accessories, polished and derivative as they were, weren’t changing anyone’s ideas about the ways fabric related to the body or the possibilities of form. The brand equity and value lies with the fame and myth of the personal brand, not the fashion brand. There’s a reason, after all, Ms. Trump did not name her line Gilded Futures, or some other such vague, kitschy title. And there’s a lesson in the last year and a half of this line for anyone who is tempted to conflate life and a shell-pink car coat. L'État, as Louis XIV said, c’est moi. The brand was her. The idea that she could dissociate herself from that sales pitch by “stepping back” from the company when she went to Washington was always patently silly. "
923,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Many Americans pay close to $100 a month for smartphone service. And this pricetag isn’t some natural reflection of the service’s value. In many other countries, smartphone plans cost much less. The economists Luigi Zingales of the University of Chicago and Mara Faccio of Purdue estimate that Americans pay $50 billion per year more than they would if they instead were paying European prices — for the same quality service. That translates into about an additional $30 per month for every American household. Zingales discusses this research in a Times op-ed and argues — correctly, I believe — that it highlights the problem with antitrust policy in the United States. We have allowed companies to grow too large, to the point that many of them have outsize power. They can raise prices, as they are doing in the cellphone market, as well as hold down wages and unduly influence government policy. Europe has taken antitrust more seriously and fought back against corporate gigantism. The recent fine against Google, for its behavior in the smartphone market, is just one example. “The United States invented antitrust and for decades has been the pioneer in its enforcement. Not anymore,” Zingales writes. “A recent paper shows that in the last two decades, enforcement in the United States has been much less strict than in Europe.” "
924,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) California has staked out a leadership role in harnessing alternative energy. But solar arrays and wind turbines are intermittent electricity sources: They don’t always produce power when it’s needed, and at times they generate so much that California must give some away to its neighbors. So the state has been looking at ways to better manage all the carbon-free energy that officials have required power companies to create. One undertaking is particularly ambitious: a $3 billion plan by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power to turn Hoover Dam into a giant battery, soaking up some of that solar and wind energy for later use. “Our challenge is: How do we get to 100 percent green?” Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said. “Storage helps. There’s no bigger battery in our system than Hoover Dam.” [Read more about the plan, including video, photos and an interactive look at how the project would expand the dam’s mission.] The proposal is the latest in a growing pool of ideas that California is grappling with to curb carbon emissions and combat climate change. As one of his last efforts before leaving office, Gov. Jerry Brown has set out to expand the state’s electric grid operator into a regional manager for most, if not all, of the West. A bill before the Assembly would expand the California Independent System Operator into a regional authority that utilities in other states could join. "
925,"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.
__________ Starbucks conducted racial bias training. Dick’s is no longer selling assault weapons. Patagonia is suing the president. In each case, a chief executive took a stand — a growing trend in corporate America. This kind of “C.E.O. activism,” which thrusts companies into politics, has been on the rise for a few years now. But recently it seems that hardly a week goes by without a senior executive inserting themselves into a contentious debate over social issues. Many Americans have noticed the trend. The public relations firm Weber Shandwick has released its third annual report on the trend, and DealBook got an early look at the study. The results underline the degree to which — whether companies like it or not — this appears to be the new normal. Here are some of the takeaways from the survey of more than 1,000 Americans: ■ People are increasingly aware of C.E.O. activism. More than a third view it favorably. ■ Nearly half of respondents believe C.E.O. activism can influence government policy. Democrats and Republicans agree that it can make an impact. ■ Less than 40 percent of respondents believe C.E.O.s “have a responsibility” to speak out. About two-thirds of Republicans said C.E.O.s should “stick to business.” ■ The top issues people want C.E.O.s to address? Training, equal pay and sexual harassment. Bottom of the list: gun control, nationalism, marijuana legalization and abortion. In a predictable effort to avoid ruffling feathers, the Weber study doesn’t call out many specific examples of activism. It doesn’t touch on Delta’s tussle with the National Rifle Association after the Parkland, Fla., shooting. There is no mention of the unraveling of the presidential advisory councils last year, when dozens of top C.E.O.s turned their backs on President Trump over his response to the Charlottesville, Va. white nationalist rally. Actually, the word “Trump” is conspicuously absent from the report. Nonetheless, the study serves as a reminder that business and politics are more entangled than ever before. “While most C.E.O.s are not accustomed to participating in the political arena,” writes Andy Polansky, the C.E.O. of Weber, “they and their companies need to be prepared to navigate these uncharted waters, whether they remain silent or not.” "
926,"Jason Spencer, the Georgia Republican lawmaker who was fooled into repeatedly yelling a racial epithet on the comedian Sacha Baron Cohen’s television series, intends to resign effective July 31. The decision was announced early Wednesday in an email from the office of David Ralston, the Georgia House speaker. It was the first real-world consequence of Mr. Cohen’s Showtime series, “Who Is America?” The show has pranked a long list of sitting and former lawmakers, including the former Vice President Dick Cheney; Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California; and the former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. The episode featuring Mr. Spencer aired on Sunday, and he initially resisted calls to resign, even from within his own party. Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican, said in a post on Twitter on Monday that “the actions and language used by Jason Spencer are appalling and offensive.” Mr. Spencer lost his primary in the spring in his bid for a fifth term and initially said he would serve out his final five months, but the drum beat became too loud. [Sacha Baron Cohen is duping Republicans. Is he the James O’Keefe of the left?] By the time the speaker’s office announced the resignation, a fierce bipartisan effort to cast Mr. Spencer out of office had taken shape. It was clear that he would face sustained public and private pressure, and black lawmakers had planned a state Capitol news conference for Wednesday morning to demand that Mr. Spencer step aside. State Senator Lester Jackson, a Democrat from Savannah and the chairman of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus, had vowed that he and other colleagues could not “continue to tolerate the well-documented and outright bigotry and reprehensible conduct” by Mr. Spencer. But Mr. Spencer faced some of the most intense condemnation from his own party, whose leaders, despite being focused on the final days of a contested primary runoff for governor, sensed deep political risk in a fast-growing state. "
927,"OSTERSUND, Sweden — A Swedish student activist stopped the deportation of an Afghan man this week by refusing to take her seat on a packed Turkish Airlines flight, and her dramatic video of the tense standoff has gone viral. The student, Elin Ersson, initially bought a ticket because she believed that a 26-year-old man from Afghanistan was being deported to Kabul from Landvetter Airport in Gothenburg via Istanbul. When she got on the plane, the 26-year-old was not there, but an Afghan deportee in his 50s was with the Swedish authorities. Ms. Ersson, 21, live-streamed the standoff on the flight late Monday on Facebook, and footage of the 14-minute video shows her in tears, at times being confronted by crew members and angry passengers. But she also garnered some support. “I’m not going to sit down until this person is off the plane,” she says in the video, “because he is most likely to get killed if he is on this plane when it goes up.” As Ms. Ersson narrates the video — which had 2.7 million views as of Wednesday afternoon — a male voice with an English accent can be heard calling her “frightening” and telling her to think of the children on the flight. “I am doing what I can to save a person’s life,” she responds. “As long as a person is standing up, the pilot cannot take off. All I want to do is stop the deportation, and then I will comply with the rules here. This is all perfectly legal, and I have not committed a crime.” "
928,"Reba McEntire, Cher, Philip Glass and Wayne Shorter will receive this year’s Kennedy Center Honors, the annual Washington distinction for artists who have made extraordinary contributions to culture. And in a first for the 41-year history of the awards, which have always gone to individuals, the Broadway musical “Hamilton” will receive a special honor. “I believe that this is a work that has transformed how we think about using art to talk about who we are as a society,” Deborah F. Rutter, the president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, said in an interview. Though typically a nonpartisan event, and one of the highlights of the Washington social calendar, the Kennedy Center honors presentation has not escaped the politicization of entertainment since the 2016 election. Last year, with a couple of the honorees, including the television producer Norman Lear, expressing discomfort with the president, Mr. Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, withdrew from attending, “to allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction,” marking just the fourth time a president missed the event. It is still unclear if the Trumps will attend this year; the White House referred questions to Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Trump, who said it was too early to say. At least two of the honorees have criticized Mr. Trump, as has Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of “Hamilton.” A representative for Cher, who campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and has compared the president to Hitler, did not return a request for comment. But in a statement through the Kennedy Center, she said, “When I was very young, I saw ‘Dumbo’ and ‘Cinderella’ and knew then what I wanted to be and the path my life would take and here I am! I am very grateful to the Kennedy Center.” "
929,"CHICAGO — For nearly five decades, the Title X family planning program has provided much needed funding for reproductive health care for millions of uninsured and underinsured people, covering basic services from cancer screenings to contraception to treatment for sexually transmitted infections. Now, the Trump administration is proposing a so-called domestic gag rule that would strictly limit how clinics that get this funding can refer patients for safe, legal abortions. Under the proposal, clinics will face a choice: either adhere to unacceptable restrictions on how they practice medicine or be cut off from funding that allows them to provide for millions of patients. As a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist, I can attest that this proposal is bad medicine; as a medical ethicist, I can also affirm it is an assault on both the patient-provider relationship and the autonomy of patients and health care providers. The consequences of the proposed rule, which is open for public comment through July 31, go beyond abortion access: It would greatly restrict patient access to effective and necessary services, from contraception to preventive care. The rule demands physical and financial separation requirements between areas that use Title X funding and those that use nonfederal funds to provide abortion services — separate physical spaces, accounting records, health records, phone numbers and more — demands that seem intended to make it impossible for clinics to operate effectively. The proposed rule is clearly an attack on Planned Parenthood, which cares for over 40 percent of Title X patients. But it also violates a more fundamental tenet of medical care: that providers be able to counsel patients about their medical options free from external interference by politically motivated rules that aren’t based on evidence. For several years, I worked at a Title X-funded clinic on the West Side of Chicago, caring primarily for patients who lacked insurance. I saw firsthand what it meant for people to have access to both preventive care and providers who were able to counsel them effectively — and what it meant when they didn’t.   I remember one patient in particular.  She was in her late 30s, and uninsured. She came to our clinic with an unintended pregnancy. She had been told, inaccurately,  that because of a medical condition, no method of hormonal birth control was safe, so she relied on condoms alone; in other words, she had received the sort of misinformation that Title X-funded clinics can help to combat. "
930,"The police have made an arrest in connection with the destruction of President Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame this week by a man with a pickax. A suspect, who has been identified as Austin Clay, 24, was arrested on Wednesday and released early Thursday morning, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff Department’s online records. He had been held on bail of $20,000 on a charge of felony vandalism, Officer Ray Brown, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department said. It is not clear who posted bail for Mr. Clay. James Otis, 54, who attempted to remove Mr. Trump’s star by smashing it with a pickax and sledgehammer in October 2016, said he had rushed to Mr. Clay’s aid but missed his mark — by the time he had arrived to help, Mr. Clay had already been released. The administrator of a GoFundMe page billed as raising money for the bail did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Clay’s next court date will be Aug. 15. “He’s a young kid,” Mr. Otis said by phone. “I’m sure he was very angry about something Trump had done. I wanted to help him because I had been in his footsteps a few years earlier. He’s got a lot to deal with.” Mr. Otis said he plans to help Mr. Clay find a lawyer or help out in any way that he can. Mr. Otis pleaded no contest to felony vandalism in February 2017. He agreed to pay $4,400 for the damage, and was sentenced to three years’ probation and 20 days of community service. "
931,"WASHINGTON — Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, told skeptical senators on Wednesday that the Trump administration has taken a truckload of punitive actions against Moscow as “proof” it is tough on Russia as the White House walked back an invitation for President Vladimir V. Putin to visit Washington this fall. Yet during a combative three-hour Senate hearing, Mr. Pompeo repeatedly declined to provide specifics about a one-on-one meeting between President Trump and Mr. Putin last week in Helsinki, Finland — including the possibility of relaxing sanctions on Moscow, military cooperation in Syria or the future of Crimea. Mr. Pompeo angrily dismissed questions about the deep gulf between the administration’s tough policies on Russia and Mr. Trump’s own warm statements about Mr. Putin. “You somehow disconnect the administration’s activities from the president’s actions,” Mr. Pompeo told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “They’re one and the same.” And for the first time, Mr. Pompeo acknowledged that North Korea is continuing to produce nuclear fuel for its weapons program, even as the administration claims progress toward the goal of denuclearization. “Yes, they continue to produce fissile material,” he told the committee, using the term for nuclear material that can be used in a bomb.

932,"This year’s Venice Film Festival will include new movies by Paul Greengrass, Alfonso Cuarón and the Coen Brothers, the festival announced at a news conference on Thursday. The 75th edition of the event opens on Aug. 29 and runs through Sept. 8. Damien Chazelle’s “First Man” — his first feature since the Oscar-winning “La La Land” — will open the festival. It stars Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong, and tells the story of the astronaut’s race to become the first person to walk on the moon. Other highly anticipated films in the lineup include “The Sisters Brothers,” a comedy Western starring Joaquin Phoenix and Jake Gyllenhaal; Rick Alverson’s “The Mountain,” starring Jeff Goldblum as a doctor who performs lobotomies; and the British director Mike Leigh’s “Peterloo,” about a notorious massacre of political protesters in 19th-century England. Those films are among 20 that will compete for the Golden Lion prize for best film. They will appear alongside television series, documentaries and a host of other movies that are not competing for that main prize. "
933,"WASHINGTON — Just before Election Day, when The Wall Street Journal uncovered a secret deal by The National Enquirer to buy the silence of a former Playboy model who said she had an affair with Donald J. Trump, his campaign issued a flat denial. “We have no knowledge of any of this,” Mr. Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, told the newspaper. She said the claim of an affair was “totally untrue.” Then last week, when The New York Times revealed the existence of a recorded conversation about the very payment Mr. Trump denied knowing about, Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, described the recording as “exculpatory” — suggesting it would actually help Mr. Trump if it became public. Finally, the tape has become public. And it revealed the statements by Ms. Hicks and Mr. Giuliani to be false. The recording, which was broadcast by CNN late Tuesday night, shows Mr. Trump was directly involved in talks about whether to pay The Enquirer for the rights to the woman’s story. The recording, and the repeated statements it contradicts, is a stark example of how Mr. Trump and his aides have used falsehoods as a shield against tough questions and unflattering coverage. Building upon his repeated cry of “fake news,” he told supporters this week not to believe the news. “What you’re seeing and what you’re reading is not what’s happening,” the president added. "
934,"WASHINGTON — Melania Trump has freedom over her own remote control. Though the standard operating procedure on Air Force One now requires televisions on board to be tuned to Fox, the president’s preferred channel, Mrs. Trump ultimately has freedom over what she watches, the East Wing said Wednesday. The statement was delivered in response to a report in The New York Times describing the president’s displeasure over Mrs. Trump’s television being tuned to CNN on the first couple’s recent European trip. In a statement sent to CNN, the first lady’s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said that it was “kind of silly” to ask what the first lady watches on TV, then added, in parenthesis, “any channel she wants.” The statement is consistent with one message the East Wing has tried to drive home on behalf of Mrs. Trump over the past year and a half. She has repeatedly directed her aides to declare that she operates independently of her husband. Examples abound. The separate events held on her trip through Europe with Mr. Trump earlier this month? “Mrs. Trump looks at her role independently,” Ms. Grisham said of activities that included visiting children and playing lawn bowls in London with the prime minister’s husband. The events the first lady held throughout the spring in her efforts to end bullying, despite being told to focus on something less controversial given her husband’s pugilistic tendencies? “Of course she knows there is going to be criticism, but she is an independent woman,” Ms. Grisham told reporters. The concern over the first lady’s health after a weeklong hospital stay and weeks out of the public eye? “Mrs. Trump has always been a strong and independent woman who puts her family, and certainly her health, above all else, and that won’t change over a rabid press corps,” Ms. Grisham said in June. And what about that jacket, inscribed with “I REALLY DON’T CARE, DO U?” that Mrs. Trump wore on the way to visit children held in detention centers near the United States border? “No one tells the first lady what to do,” Ms. Grisham said. “Our office has nothing to do with what clothing choices she makes and this situation was no different.” As far as the first lady’s channel-changing independence goes, Mrs. Trump and her office stay abreast of coverage of the White House, particularly anything about the East Wing. And she has said in the past that she prefers fictional TV dramas. She is a fan of the show “Empire,” and enjoys the Shonda Rhimes-created drama “How to Get Away With Murder.” She does not enjoy reality TV. On Wednesday, Ms. Grisham did not answer a question from The New York Times asking if Mrs. Trump agreed with her husband that his supporters should not believe what they hear in the news. "
935,"WASHINGTON — Education Secretary Betsy DeVos proposed on Wednesday to curtail Obama administration loan forgiveness rules for students defrauded by for-profit colleges, requiring that student borrowers show they have fallen into hopeless financial straits or prove that their colleges knowingly deceived them. The DeVos proposal, set to go in force a year from now, would replace Obama-era policies that sought to ease access to loan forgiveness for students who were left saddled with debt after two for-profit college chains, Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute, imploded in 2015 and 2016. The schools were found to have misled their students with false advertisements and misleading claims for years. Afterward, the Obama administration forgave hundreds of millions of dollars in student loans and began rewriting regulations to crack down on predatory institutions and bolster borrowers’ ability to seek debt relief from the federal government. But higher education institutions, including historically black colleges and universities and for-profit educators, maintained the new rules were far too broad and subjected them to frivolous claims that carried significant financial risks. In June 2017, just one month before the Obama rules were to take effect, Ms. DeVos announced that she would block and rewrite them. Now the Trump administration is proposing new rules that would require borrowers to prove that they have fallen into deep financial distress to file a claim for debt relief, or to prove that the higher education institutions they attended had intentionally misled them. The department would also require that relief applicants divulge personal information that could have impacted their job prospects beyond their college experiences, including drug test results, health concerns and performance evaluations. The proposal would establish a federal standard for what constitutes “misrepresentation” on the part of institutions, requiring that claims show “reckless disregard” through false or deceptive claims. It would also impose penalties on institutions that show signs of poor financial health, such as a high number of loan defaults or court judgments. "
936,"WASHINGTON — A lawsuit accusing President Trump of violating the Constitution by maintaining a financial interest in his company’s Washington hotel cleared a critical hurdle on Wednesday when a federal judge allowed the case to move forward. In the first judicial opinion to define how the meaning of the Constitution’s anticorruption clauses should apply to a president, Judge Peter J. Messitte of the United States District Court in Greenbelt, Md., said the framers’ language should be broadly construed as an effort to protect against influence-peddling by state and foreign governments. He ruled that the lawsuit should proceed to the evidence-gathering stage, which could clear the way for an examination of financial records that the president has consistently refused to disclose. The Justice Department is expected to forestall that by seeking an emergency stay and appealing the ruling. The two constitutional clauses at issue restrict a president’s ability to accept financial benefits or “emoluments” from domestic or foreign governments, other than his official salary. No federal judge before has ever interpreted what those bans mean for the president. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, the District of Columbia and the State of Maryland, say that Mr. Trump is violating those bans by accepting profits from the Trump International Hotel, a five-star hotel just blocks from the White House that is frequented by foreign and state officials. The judge earlier ruled that the local jurisdictions had standing to sue because the Trump hotel arguably siphons off business from their convention centers or hotels. Mr. Trump has resisted efforts to force him to provide more details about his personal finances, and in particular has refused to release his tax returns. Questions about Mr. Trump’s possible business dealings in Russia or with Russians have come up in connection with the inquiry being conducted by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. "
937,"For a business that concerns itself with fit and figure flattery, it has taken the fashion industry an unusually — some might say, unforgivably — long time to recognize the obvious fact that we are not all the same size. Worse, labels that did address those who are size 14 and over were relegated to a category all their own, as if they were not part of mainstream fashion. Now, however, a handful of pioneering companies are changing that pattern with inclusive sizing that covers both ends of the spectrum. Best of all, these labels don’t make a big show of it. They simply make cool clothes in a variety of sizes. Introduced in 2015, Universal Standard’s mission was simple: Make shopping as fun, and accessible, for a size 26 as it is for a size 6. The founders, Alexandra Waldman and Polina Veksler, thought that approach was sorely missing, even as the industry grapples with the fact that 67 percent of women in the United States wear a size 14 or above. “A lot of brands still think the solution to the problem is to launch a plus-size category,” Ms. Waldman said. “That is not the answer. We need to stop segregating women into two groups because the truth of the matter is that it’s not so much a size thing, but a style thing.” Ms. Waldman noted that the clothes being designed for women in double-digit sizes do not have the level of design or quality of smaller sizes. “It’s mostly a semi-disposable, hodgepodge of fast fashion,” she said. Universal Standard aims to bring the same attention to style, fit and fabric as any other contemporary label — an aspirational aesthetic that’s size accessible. It’s no wonder the label caught the attention of J. Crew, which collaborated on a summer capsule collection that’s as sophisticated as it is wearable. "
938,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Promises $12 Billion in Aid to Prop Up Farms” (front page, July 25): America’s hard-working agricultural producers deserve guaranteed access to markets, not government handouts. If President Trump believes  that his tariffs are the right move, he should be strong enough to persuade farmers of their wisdom or weather the political consequences, as opposed to buying them off with taxpayer money. Nic Arp
Iowa City To the Editor: Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, calls President Trump’s promise of $12 billion to America’s farmers “gold crutches,” a political payoff to limit the pain from Mr. Trump’s trade war.  A better analogy comes from your article on the taped conversation between the president and Michael Cohen about hush money for the Playboy model Karen McDougal (“Cohen Releases Tape of Trump, Adding to Feud,” front page, July 25). The president’s M.O. is consistent. In both cases, he turns to financial payments to try to get out of trouble and minimize personal damage. In Ms. McDougal’s case, we don’t know who fronted the hush money. In the case of the farmers, we do: It will come from you and me in order to buy a key Trump constituency’s silence, loyalty and votes. Richard Kazis

939,"Fewer than 50 pages into Beth Macy’s “Dopesick: Dealers, Doctors, and the Drug Company That Addicted America,” one of the many opioid users she talks to — this one a mother in Virginia — explains how her addiction started in the early 2000s, after routine gallbladder surgery. “The doctor didn’t force me to take them,” she said of OxyContin and Percocet, two powerful painkillers she was instructed to take concurrently. But her doctor, she assumed, was a “high-standard person, someone you’re supposed to trust and believe in.” If you want a glimpse into how the opioid crisis began, the woman’s words are a good place to start. She was aware of her own choice in the matter, but her physician instructed her to double up on highly addictive narcotics. An expert, someone supposed to know better, had betrayed her trust. Books like “Pain Killer,” by Barry Meier, a reporter for The New York Times, and “Dreamland,” by the journalist Sam Quinones, have covered the opioid crisis in detail, but they appeared before the 2016 election, when the places in the country most affected by the epidemic went for Trump. With “Dopesick,” her third book after “Factory Man” and “Truevine,” Macy has waded into a public health morass that has also become a political minefield. Commentators on the left have pointed out the gaping discrepancy between the sympathy extended to today’s opioid users, who are mainly white, and the brutal, racist handling of the war on crack. “Dopesick” touches on these political developments, but its emphasis lies elsewhere. Macy’s strengths as a reporter are on full display when she talks to people, gaining the trust of chastened users, grieving families, exhausted medical workers and even a convicted heroin dealer, whose scheduled two-hour interview with the author ended up stretching to more than six hours. Macy captures an Appalachian landscape in a state of emergency and in the grip of disillusionment, but there’s little here that’s new. Indeed, that’s part of her point — not enough has changed. Like Quinones and Meier, she traces the beginning of the current epidemic to 1996, when Purdue Pharma released OxyContin with the claim (preposterous in hindsight) that its new pills would be less addictive than other opioids on the market. Yes, OxyContin contained more medication than the others, but its time-release formula (the “contin” was pharma-speak for “continuous”) would frustrate an impatient addict looking for a quick high. "
940,"Workers may finally be getting a bigger piece of the economic pie — at least in Europe. Just don’t ask why, or whether it will last. In the decade since the financial crisis, much of the global economy has recovered and is back on stable footing. Companies are reporting record profits, unemployment levels are plummeting and overall global growth is back on track. Wages in most developed countries, however, have barely budged. The economic puzzle has ramifications for global political as well as financial stability. Resentment among middle- and lower-class workers, and the feeling they were not getting a fair share of economic growth, helped elect Donald J. Trump and contributed to the rise of right-wing parties in parts of Europe. “This is one of the big economic questions of our time,” said Ángel Talavera, lead eurozone economist at Oxford Economics in London. Europe may offer an exception to that trend. Wages in the eurozone are rising again after years of stagnation, a welcome development not only for working people but also for Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank. The central bank has been pulling out all the stops to push inflation back toward a level considered healthy for growth. But wage increases are effectively a prerequisite for sustained inflation, and, until recently, the bank had been frustrated by the failure of eurozone citizens’ paychecks to rise along with strong economic growth. "
941,"My fellow Americans: It is my honor today to announce the formation of a new political party, which I am calling “the Republican Party.” You can be forgiven for thinking, Wait, don’t we already have one of those? But please. Under Donald Trump, the Republican Party, at least as we once understood it, has become a fantastical entity, a creature not wholly unlike the Abominable Snowman, or the Chupacabra, or the mythical Squonk of central Pennsylvania, the imaginary creature that spends its days deep in the forest, weeping in despair at its own hideousness. “There is no Republican Party,” said John Boehner, a former Republican speaker of the House, back in April. “There’s a Trump Party. The Republican Party is kind of taking a nap somewhere.” While the Republican Party naps, the thing that has arisen in its place bears an eerie resemblance to another party in American history, one that we thought was gone for good. But more about that in a moment. In the meantime, I’d like to present the platform of my new Republican Party. It consists of things formerly believed by, you know, the Republican Party. "
942,"Good morning on this stillrainy Wednesday. Among the ways to get around this city — rickshaw, subway, scooter, ferry — we now have one more option: dockless bikes. Over the last week or so, more than 300 free-standing bikes were rolled out in the Rockaways, and more are on their way this weekend. The bikes are part of the city’s dockless bike-share pilot — think Citi Bike without the parking spot — and they will be installed in the Bronx, southern Brooklyn and Staten Island in the coming months. Using the bikes is a breeze. We spent the day yesterday testing them out at the beach. When we stepped out of the Beach 90th Street subway station at Rockaway Beach, we found one of the bikes waiting for us. There appeared to be one on every nearby block — parked in front of bakeries, playgrounds and up and down the boardwalk. To ride, we downloaded separate apps from Pace and Lime (the two operators), signed up for accounts, flipped up kickstands and off we went. The bikes are much the same, but Pace bikes require that you lock them to a designated bike rack or pole, while Lime bikes must be left in designated zones. Both Pace and Lime’s bikes cost $1 every 30 minutes. If you want to try them out, we suggest this weekend when Lime will be adding 100 pedal-assist bikes to its fleet. (Legislation allowing them in the city goes into effect on Saturday.) The bikes make pedaling easier and allow riders to travel faster and farther with less energy. "
943,"WASHINGTON — President Trump abruptly announced on Thursday that the United States would impose “large sanctions” on Turkey for detaining an American pastor accused of aiding a failed coup attempt there in 2016, escalating a bitter dispute among the two NATO allies. Mr. Trump’s declaration on Twitter appeared to be more of a muscular threat than an official statement of policy; the administration made no announcement of specific punitive measures against the Turkish government, and the White House declined to provide any details about the steps it was ready to take. It came one day after Andrew Brunson, 50, an evangelical pastor who has been imprisoned in Turkey for 21 months, was moved from jail to house arrest because of health concerns. Mr. Brunson is one of 20 Americans charged after the failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. His case has elevated tensions between the United States and Turkey even as Mr. Trump has sought warmer relations with Mr. Erdogan. On Thursday, Mr. Trump ratcheted up the pressure for Mr. Brunson’s immediate release, telling Mr. Erdogan in a private phone call that the pastor’s continued imprisonment was unacceptable, according to a White House official who described the conversation on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it publicly. And the president vowed on Twitter to impose substantial sanctions on Turkey for Mr. Brunson’s detention. "
944,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Thursday gave the green light to a lawsuit seeking to block the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census, saying plaintiffs had made a plausible case that the move was a deliberate attempt by the White House to discriminate against immigrants. The ruling, by United States District Judge Jesse M. Furman in Manhattan, set the stage for a trial this fall that is expected to delve into how and why the Trump administration decided in March to add a question to the next census about citizenship status. The plaintiffs, which include state and local governments and advocacy groups, claim that asking residents to verify their citizenship would “fatally undermine” the accuracy of the head count because both legal and undocumented immigrants would refuse to fill out the form. A reduced count in areas with large immigrant populations could reduce Democratic representation when new state and congressional districts are drawn in 2021, and skew the distribution of hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants and other spending. Judge Furman rejected a claim that Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr., who made the decision to add the question to the census form, lacked the authority to do so. But the judge said the circumstances surrounding Mr. Ross’s actions, including his shifting explanation of what he did and why, raised questions about his true intent. Mr. Ross originally said he acted at the request of the Justice Department, which he said needed better citizenship data to enforce the 1965 Voting Rights Act. But he later admitted — and Commerce Department documents confirmed — that he had discussed the citizenship question with administration officials from almost the beginning of his tenure in the department, and that he or his aides had asked the Justice Department to request that the question be added. "
945,"It didn’t take long last week for President Trump to blast America’s latest economic foe, the European Union, for imposing a $5.1 billion antitrust fine on Google’s parent company. “I told you so!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. Calling Google one of “our great companies,” he asserted that the European Union “has truly taken advantage of the U.S., but not for long!” Let’s put aside the fact that Google controls more than 90 percent of the internet search market in most of the union’s member states, according to the European Commission (compared with just 63.5 percent of the market in the United States). That makes it hard to argue that the Europeans have somehow “taken advantage” of Google. But on the merits of the antitrust case, Mr. Trump has a point. It’s hard to find any antitrust expert, European or American, who has endorsed the logic or outcome of the ruling by the European Commission. The commission, which is the union’s executive arm and oversees its competition policy and antitrust law, found that Google had run afoul of those regulations in several respects. But the heart of the decision involved Google’s insistence that mobile phone manufacturers that use its Android operating system and want to preinstall the Google Play app store must also install a suite of Google apps, including the company’s search engine, its Chrome browser and its mapping, calendar and photo programs. "
946,"WASHINGTON — Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a powerful hard-line conservative who has been embroiled in a sexual abuse scandal from his days as a college wrestling coach, announced on Thursday that he will run to succeed Paul D. Ryan as House speaker. Mr. Jordan’s bid is sure to roil the already shaky succession of power that Mr. Ryan set in motion when he announced that he would retire at the end of the year. Publicly, Republican leaders have backed the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California. Privately, some Republicans have said Mr. McCarthy would not be able to unite the fractious party, and the No. 3 Republican in the House, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, is waiting in the wings. Now comes the divisive figure of Mr. Jordan, who has the backing of the small but important House Freedom Caucus, which he founded, and outside conservative groups that have been pushing him to run. He has divided Republicans repeatedly with his aggressive tactics, most recently this week by filing articles of impeachment against the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein. Mr. Ryan responded Thursday by saying he would not back the action, and the House left for its monthlong August recess without taking it up. “I don’t think we should be cavalier with this process or with this term,” the speaker told reporters. “I don’t think that this rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors.” But in some sense, the political damage to Republicans was done. Looking for a foil ahead of the midterm elections, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, latched on, suggesting that conservatives had moved to impeach Mr. Rosenstein merely to divert attention from the former college wrestlers who have accused Mr. Jordan of knowing about sexual misconduct at Ohio State University and doing nothing.

947,"To the Editor: Re “Pompeo Defends President as Being Harsh With Russia” (news article, July 26): Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is no wallflower. He’s a West Point graduate, at the top of his class, and I remember his grilling then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during her 11 hours of testimony on the Benghazi hearings when he was a representative. His questions were withering, but Mrs. Clinton held her own and then some. So I expected Mr. Pompeo to be a bulldog in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But I also expected a fierce pushback from the senators on that committee. These men and women are our elected representatives, and I expect them to react to stonewalling by breaking through that wall — although I do applaud Senator Bob Corker for his principled stand as committee chairman. Mr. Pompeo’s performance was pompous and sarcastic. He was incredibly disrespectful to duly elected officials, and he was among their ranks at one time! He referred to backing up a truck with documents to prove Donald Trump’s zeal in holding Russia accountable. The only truck I want backing up is a moving van to the White House door. Len DiSesa

948,"To the Editor: Re “The Truth About ‘Trump Country,’” by Sarah Smarsh (Op-Ed, July 20): People’s use of the convenient “Trump country” label to describe the states that voted for the president not only lacks nuance, but is also a subliminal tool of differentiation and condescension that only exacerbates the growing urban and rural divide that plagues America. This term is wielded to write off these places as just aberrations from what supposedly smart and sane politics would yield. It contributes to the sentiment on the left that these people in rural areas who voted for a perceived huckster and demagogue are a lost cause, that now that these people cast their lot with this man, it is beyond conceivable to engage with them, understand them and empathize with them. This notion is pervasive, but for Democrats to take back the Midwest and make inroads in the South, it must be expunged. Tyler Coady
Nashville To the Editor: Sarah Smarsh misses the mark in blaming the media for its alleged one-dimensional portrait of the working class. “Elites” are fully aware that people of color actually make up a good bit of the working class. That Trump supporters do not all rant about race or immigration does not absolve them of attaching themselves to a demagogue who does, to say nothing of the misogyny, disrespect for veterans and public servants, willful ignorance of world affairs and other disgraces. It is time to stop blaming “liberals” for the ascent of Donald Trump. His supporters (and enablers) got us into this mess and continue to abide his venality. As Ms. Smarsh acknowledges, not all Trump voters — even in the heartland — fit the working-class stereotype. Many of them are well educated, gainfully employed, Chardonnay-drinking professionals with summer homes and are set for life. In a word, elites. Helene Kopal
Katonah, N.Y. To the Editor: Sarah Smarsh notes a rise in populism, not just on America’s right wing, but the socialist left wing as well. As a psychologist I am privileged to hear people’s uncensored opinions about the world in the context of their lives. Almost everyone I speak to believes he or she is being victimized by “big business” or “big government,” depending on which cable news stations they watch. The problem is not with business or government itself, but how “big” institutions tend to objectify people. As these institutions continue to grow in influence, over Trump country and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez country, so will populism on both sides grow. John G. Cottone
Stony Brook, N.Y. To the Editor: Sarah Smarsh is caught in the very trap she accuses “the college-educated white liberals” of being in. She seems to assume that the white liberal elite is monolithic and thinks that working-class folks wield bats and belittle women. Her whole premise is off. The college-educated folks in this country are as varied across the board as those with just a high school degree. Her specious argument is unhelpful to the healthy discussion this country desperately needs to have about its future. Margaret A. Lambert

949,"MUMBAI, India — Last year, the Trump administration blocked a Chinese company from buying an Ohio-based aluminum maker, Aleris, citing concerns about national security. Will President Trump and his advisers feel differently about an Indian company purchasing Aleris instead? On Thursday, one of India’s biggest industrial conglomerates, the Aditya Birla Group, announced that its aluminum and copper subsidiary had struck a deal to buy Aleris for $2.6 billion, including the assumption of existing debt. The transaction would make the Birla subsidiary, called Hindalco, the second-largest aluminum producer in the world by volume, after China Hongqiao Group. Under federal rules, the deal requires approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a secretive panel of government officials that advises the president on whether to stop acquisitions of American companies by foreigners. In recent years, the panel, known as Cfius, has been particularly skeptical of Chinese companies seeking to buy American businesses in important industries like computer chips and financial services.

951,"The Commerce Department recently asked for public comments on the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on automobiles and auto parts. When the deadline for submissions hit, more than 2,000 individuals, businesses and organizations had had their say. The vast majority were opposed to the tariffs. Following are edited excerpts from some of those comments. During the Great Recession of 2007-2009, Honda did not lay off any of its full-time permanent associates in the U.S., and we have continued to increase our employment numbers since then. If the concern is that imports are damaging the national economy, Section 232 [of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962] is not the right tool to address the problem. There is an arsenal of weapons in U.S. trade law that enable the government to address economic risk. Actions can be brought for dumping, countervailing duties, patent infringement and safeguard protections, to name a few. VWGoA [Volkswagen Group of America] does not see how continuing imports of automobiles and automotive parts at current levels could impair U.S. national security. This proposition — supported by no U.S. motor vehicle manufacturer — is implausible. VWGoA’s plant has created 12,400 full-time jobs in Tennessee and helped attract 17 supplier companies to the Chattanooga area. These supplier companies in turn have invested over $275 million in Tennessee and, in so doing, created an additional 1,100 jobs. VWGoA’s manufacturing operations likewise have increased local and state tax revenues by $53.5 million annually. "

953,"Frank Bruni, a Times Op-Ed columnist, hosted an online conversation with two prominent Democrats: Representative Tim Ryan, a congressman from Ohio; and Jane Harman, the director and president of the Wilson Center and a former congresswoman from California. They discussed the challenges and opportunities that the 2018 midterms pose for Democrats. Frank Bruni: The week began with a few polls that show that Democrats have an advantage of over 10 percentage points when voters are asked if they theoretically prefer to vote for a Democrat or a Republican in a House race. Is a blue wave on the way? Jane Harman: I’ve seen lots of waves crest a week before the election. Democrats need to have a strong, positive message. Bruni: And are you hearing such a message, or is the party still fumbling around for it? Harman: Democrats announced a strong economic message (“a better deal”) early in the year, but it hasn’t gotten much traction. Sadly, most of the rhetoric is focused on how bad the Republican leadership is in Congress and the enormous number of mixed messages by the administration. Bruni: Few congressional primary-race victors have received as much attention, and generated as much big-picture debate, as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. What does and what doesn’t she say about the Democratic Party right now and about its best course to win the House? Tim Ryan: As someone who at 29 years old took on two sitting Democratic members of Congress to get to Congress, I’m always inspired by the energy of the insurgent-type campaigns. We have many inspiring candidates, mostly women, running all over the country. To help end the corruption of the current political system. "
954,"Michael Lewis has spent his career excavating subjects that seem, at first glance, almost aggressively boring: esoteric areas like sabermetrics, heuristics, mortgage-backed securities and credit-default swaps, algorithmic trading based on high-frequency financial data, sovereign debt. No matter how arcane the material, he invariably finds some fascinating narrative thread to suck readers in. His latest work, about government bureaucracy, is no exception. “The Fifth Risk,” which W.W. Norton will publish in October, paints a dire picture of the chaos and mismanagement in the departments of Energy, Agriculture and Commerce during the transition from President Barack Obama to President Trump. Within these seemingly dull, benign bureaucratic systems, Mr. Lewis encountered devoted public servants struggling with understaffed and neglected agencies while confronting potentially catastrophic risks. In the Department of Energy, which oversees international nuclear risk, understaffing means there might not be enough inspectors to track down black market uranium. Proposed cuts within the Department of Agriculture could dilute critical anti-poverty programs like school lunches and food stamps. “I was shocked by the richness of the material,” Mr. Lewis said. “Buried in the middle of this is a civics lesson, for myself as much as anyone else.” The book began last year as a series of dispatches for Vanity Fair, where Mr. Lewis was a contributing writer for a decade. (He has since left the magazine and shifted his longform journalism to Audible, the audiobook producer and retailer). Mr. Lewis went to Washington to report on how different departments were adapting under the Trump administration. His dreary-sounding assignment was to study the material that had been prepared for political appointees coming in to head the departments under the new administration. (Agriculture employees, for example, had prepared a 13-volume overview of its programs that spanned 2,300 pages). He found it riveting. In another section, which will be released as an audio original by Audible next week, Mr. Lewis writes about the Department of Commerce, and efforts by AccuWeather chief executive Barry Myers, who has been nominated to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to privatize weather forecasting. [ Read more about how Mr. Lewis and other best-selling authors who are writing audio originals ] Although he’s covered political campaigns, writing about the inner workings of government was a first for Mr. Lewis, who is best known for narrative page-turners like “Moneyball” and “The Big Short.” He says he approached it the same way he’s infiltrated other seemingly impenetrable institutions. “It’s not that different from writing about Wall Street, these big, gray institutions that are suddenly interesting,” he said. “From a literary point of view, Trump has electrified the material by the threat of neglect and mismanagement on a scale that we haven’t seen before.” "

Colbert also got a kick out of a Fox News interview in which Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer for Trump, said he had heard there were 12 extant tapes of Cohen and Trump speaking, before quickly adding, “Don’t quote me on that.” Seth Meyers teamed up with his former “Saturday Night Live” colleague Amy Poehler for a segment called “Really!?!” The subject was James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, who said on Twitter this week that the Democratic Party should not move leftward.

956,"Gender Letter is a weekly take on news and culture. Tell me what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com. My friend’s question was simple: Are there any foods that help ease the intensity of hot flashes? She went online hoping to find a community of women who could help her navigate a transition — menopause — that half the population will experience. What she found instead were recommendations for drugstore supplements like ginseng and ... tofu. I was surprised, but I shouldn’t have been. Women’s health issues and biological processes have long been shrouded in secrecy and shame. Who among us hasn’t hidden our pad or tampon wrappers under a wad of toilet paper, lest we appear unattractive or messy? The result: We feel alone, often at a young age, when we are anything but. [Sign up here to get future installments of the Gender Letter delivered to your inbox.] Worse yet, data suggests that bias can lead doctors to dismiss women’s health problems. (Even Serena Williams felt her concerns after childbirth were snubbed by hospital personnel.) And for girls and women around the world, these taboos can have tragic consequences: In a corner of Nepal, girls have died after being banished from their homes while menstruating; in Kenya, poorer girls may trade sex to afford pads. But there’s a growing wave of women who are speaking openly and unabashedly about their health issues, giving the middle finger to modesty and bringing these once-private struggles into the public sphere.

957,"When President Trump accused Twitter of “shadow banning” Republicans in a tweet on Thursday morning, it was the latest salvo in a long-running debate over whether social media platforms suppress conservative users because of their political views. The president’s tweet came a day after a widely circulated article published by Vice News said that Twitter was shadow banning “prominent Republicans.” But many in the tech world said the Vice story — which was shared by prominent conservatives on Twitter, including the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy; James O’Keefe; and Donald Trump Jr.  — was based on a misunderstanding of the concept of shadow banning that could make an already tense debate more acrimonious. So, what is going on here? What is shadow banning? Was Twitter actually doing it? Why is the president involved? We’ve got you covered. When a person is shadow banned, their posts on a platform are rendered essentially invisible to everyone but themselves. Their experience using a site may not change — they feel like they are still posting normally — but other people cannot see the material they produce, said Monica Stephens, a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo who studies social media. “Shadow banning is when you are algorithmically being kind of shut down, and that often has to do with, particularly, the content that you are posting,” Ms. Stephens said. “Maybe it doesn’t violate the terms of service, but they make it so other people can’t see that content.” "
958,"WASHINGTON — When he ran against Donald J. Trump in 2016 for the Republican presidential nomination, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky quipped that “a speck of dirt would make a better president” than the bombastic businessman from New York. Then came President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, his government’s interference in a White House campaign in which Mr. Paul barely made a ripple and last week’s presidential summit meeting in Helsinki, Finland, which pretty much everyone but Mr. Paul deemed a diplomatic disaster. Suddenly, in the mind of the junior senator from Kentucky, Mr. Trump has soared from lower than that speck of dirt to high enough for Mount Rushmore. “The hatred for the president is so intense that partisans would rather risk war than give diplomacy a chance,” Mr. Paul fumed on the Senate floor last week in a long defense of Mr. Trump’s Helsinki meeting. “This is crazy.” As the lonely Senate voice extolling Mr. Trump’s diplomatic acumen, Mr. Paul has become the commander in chief’s wingman. He has nabbed broad visibility for views once deemed fringe, and coveted White House access: “Thank you @RandPaul, you really get it!” the president tweeted. It was the senator’s idea to suspend the security clearances of Mr. Trump’s political enemies, an idea embraced at the lectern by the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. "
959,"SEOUL, South Korea — Growing up here in the 1970s, Kyungah Ham would occasionally find propaganda leaflets sent from North Korea via helium balloons. Like her classmates, Ms. Ham turned in the leaflets at school, where she was given a reward for doing a small part in South Korea’s simmering ideological war with its neighbor. In 2008, when Ms. Ham found another North Korean leaflet — this one under the gate of her parents’ home — it felt like an alien object, blown in from a different planet. By then, she was a multimedia artist who had come to distrust much of the history she’d been taught, and she knew that South Koreans were sending leaflets of their own over the border. That got her wondering: Could she communicate directly with people who, through a geopolitical tragedy now 65 years old, she is forbidden to contact? It was the birth of what might be the art world’s most extraordinary, ongoing collaboration. For a decade, Ms. Ham has been producing designs on her computer that are printed and smuggled into North Korea through intermediaries based in Russia or China. Then a group of anonymous artisans, whom she has never met or spoken to, are paid to convert them into embroideries, using exquisitely fine stitching. With bribes and subterfuge, the works are smuggled back out. Ultimately, they are shown and sold at galleries and exhibitions. The most ambitious pieces are large-scale renderings of luminous, glittering chandeliers, some nearly 12 feet wide and 9 feet high, that from a distance look like photographs set against black backdrops. Get closer, and a filigree of stitches appear. Both chandelier and backdrop have been painstakingly composed of silk thread. On one level, her embroideries are an attempt to reunite through art people who were forcibly separated in 1953 through war. The work marries the strength of the South (technology) to the strength of the North (craftsmanship), and it is confected through a hazard-filled maze. "
960,"In his first inaugural address in 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio invoked the names of legendary reformers, from Fiorello La Guardia to Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, and said that in their honor and spirit, he would “commit to a new progressive direction in New York.” The anticipation for many of Mr. de Blasio’s supporters was particularly keen because it built on the sense that his predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, had presided over the city’s growth in a way that benefited the well-off and left the poor behind. But midway through his fifth year in office, Mr. de Blasio has disappointed some of his most loyal backers, who point to a range of issues, from criminal justice reform and homelessness to the protection of immigrants, where the mayor has fallen short of his promises. On Monday, Mr. de Blasio found himself having to explain why, after enacting a policy to end solitary confinement in city jails, the city Department of Correction increased the number of inmates shipped upstate, where they were put in solitary. He defended the actions as rare and necessary for safety. Other promises have also run up against reality. The city has not succeeded in opening new neighborhood-based homeless shelters as fast as Mr. de Blasio had vowed. His recurring pledge to raise taxes on high-earners has been dashed in Albany, where the mayor holds little sway and has been embroiled in a yearslong feud with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. "

The president’s tweets attacking Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey are being scrutinized as part of a broad inquiry into possible obstruction of justice. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, above, is examining whether the actions add up to attempts to obstruct the investigation by both intimidating witnesses and pressuring senior law enforcement officials to tamp down the inquiry. Mr. Mueller wants to question the president about the tweets. Mr. Trump’s lawyers said that none of the evidence Mr. Mueller is looking at constitutes obstruction. Here’s how Mr. Trump’s private and public statements line up in a possible obstruction case. _____ "
962,"A powerful commander in Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps escalated the invective duel with President Trump on Thursday, calling his threat against Iran’s president “cabaret-style rhetoric” in remarks that political analysts called worrisome. The commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, who wields enormous influence in Iran, may emerge as its future leader and is considered a terrorist mastermind by the United States. He said that Mr. Trump should pick a fight directly with him and not Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani. In a Twitter message on Sunday posted in all-capital letters, Mr. Trump warned Mr. Rouhani that he would suffer “consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before” if he threatened the United States. Top aides to Mr. Rouhani dismissed Mr. Trump’s warning, apparently viewing it as an attempt by the American president to replicate his strategy of threats against another adversary, North Korea. But General Suleimani’s public challenge to Mr. Trump appeared to signal that the Iranian hierarchy felt obliged to send a more assertive reply. "
963,"WASHINGTON — When President Trump called a truce with the European Union over trade, the general outlines of his plan sounded familiar. It echoed of earlier negotiations — the ones started under President Barack Obama and shelved by Mr. Trump last year. Mr. Trump, in many ways, is taking credit for solving a crisis of his own making. After taking office, he criticized the deals of his predecessor and cut off trade talks with the European Union. He raised the stakes by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum, prompting retaliatory measures by the European Union. Then he stoked the tensions by calling Europe a “foe.” Now, Mr. Trump, in hashing out an agreement on Wednesday with president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, is declaring victory. He said the two sides would work to lower tariffs and other trade barriers. They would reduce bureaucratic roadblocks to industrial goods flowing across the Atlantic, while ending conflicting regulations for drugs and chemicals. The United States was pursuing much the same under Mr. Obama through a deal called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. And the collapse of the deal still smarts for large segments of American and European business who had fervently hoped to create a trans-Atlantic version of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The European Union has repeatedly told the Trump administration that it would be happy to revive trade talks. “Most of the deal is stuff we were already on the verge of agreeing on in the T.T.I.P. negotiations, before that deal got deep-sixed after Trump’s election,” said Rufus Yerxa, the president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents exporters. “But at least the President is talking about more open trade instead of how great tariffs are.” Both European and American officials resisted comparisons to previous negotiations. But it was not immediately clear what would set the new talks apart from those carried out by the Obama administration, beyond their more limited scope. Unlike with the previous round of negotiations, European officials said that the agricultural sector would be excluded from a deal with the Trump administration. "
964,"We live in the age of extinction, a quiet catastrophe that surely ranks as one of the great ecological and moral crises of our time. The best tool for saving America’s imperiled animals and plants is the Endangered Species Act, first passed by Congress in 1973. But you wouldn’t know it from what’s been happening recently in the nation’s capital. Last week, the Trump administration proposed major changes to the law. Although some offered welcome clarifications and efficiencies, others would strike at the core of the law that now protects more than 2,000 threatened and endangered species, from the largest animal on the planet, the blue whale, to the Florida perforate cladonia, a two-inch lichen found only in the state. Among the most worrisome is a proposal that would allow cost considerations to influence whether a species qualifies for protection or should be left to its fate. Decisions are now based on the best available science, and references to economic impacts are prohibited. Introducing cost criteria would circumvent the science that keeps the listing process honest. The plan also would give the administration the discretion to  scale back protections for some species listed as threatened in future determinations. The administration’s proposal joins legislative efforts to retool the law. In examining them, we should ask two questions: Will these changes increase populations of endangered species, or at least slow their decline? And will they advance cooperation and reduce conflicts between the federal government and states, industries and landowners? Almost none of these recent proposals pass this test. Several weeks ago, Senator John Barrasso, a Republican of Wyoming, introduced perhaps the most comprehensive proposal in over a decade to retool the law. His bill promotes the longstanding desire of many, mostly Western, states to claim control over endangered species management. If it were to become law, the bill would hurt efforts to save many species. "
965,"Over 100 years ago, Coco Chanel transformed herself from peasant orphan into the founder of a fashion empire. She was the avatar of a new century — unmarried and independent, a woman who took lovers and took off her corset. Chanel’s alluring life became her most bankable commodity. Women clamored for Chanel products (or inexpensive imitations of them) not just for their sleek looks, but because those products seemed to grant entry into the designer’s enviable world. By turning her initials into a logo — those famous interlocking C’s — Chanel crystallized her marketable identity into a recognizable badge of prestige. Chanel invented a business model that fashion companies still use, wherein success depends as much on a glamorous life narrative as on particular garments. Within this model, which I call “immersive dreamscapes,” customers buy not just products but also aspirational identities. By acquiring merchandise bearing logos or signatures, they label themselves with the desired identity. Not coincidentally, Chanel’s movement peaked in influence between the two world wars, precisely as fascism became a pan-European force. Like luxury-logo fashion, fascism enticed followers with an alluring narrative about an exclusive world  (the myth of the superior Aryans)  and a logo  (the swastika)  betokening membership in that world. Chanel traveled in fascist circles and invented her double-C insignia in 1921, just one year after the Nazis adopted the swastika, which they treated like a fashion label, stamping it on jewelry, clothing, even lingerie, in addition to military uniforms. To be clear, wearing Chanel does not make one a Nazi. But the joint rise of her brand and fascism came about because both tapped into and manipulated certain all-too-human, paradoxical yearnings, particularly resonant at the time: to belong to a select elite and to lose oneself in a crowd, to conform. Chanel was deeply in dialogue with her era’s politics; as is Ivanka Trump. We can trace the descent of “dreamscape” businesses from Chanel, to Ralph Lauren (Bronx-born Ralph Lifshitz, peddling a dream world of polo-playing WASP privilege), through Tory Burch, directly to Ms. Trump, whose brand, which she announced this week was shutting down, employs both her full signature and an initial insignia, although her logo feels rather unmemorable. (Her “IT” motif bears a curious resemblance to back-to-back C’s.) "
966,"Prepare to be excited about a blockbuster economic report on Friday morning — but not too excited. Preliminary data from the Commerce Department is expected to show that United States gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of more than 4 percent in April through June. Some economists think growth may have topped 5 percent — a figure reached only once in the eight years of the Obama administration as the economy recovered from the recession. While he said he didn’t know the actual number, President Trump didn’t wait to herald the rosy news. At an event in Iowa on Thursday, he said he was expecting a very strong result, noting predictions that ran to 5 percent or higher. “It could be very close,” he said. “Could even happen.” “We’ll take anything with a four in front,” he added. [Update: On Friday the government said that the economy grew at a 4.1 percent annual rate last quarter.] Even a number starting with a four, though, will almost certainly be misleading. Several one-time factors — including a surge in exports tied, at least in part, to Mr. Trump’s trade policies — probably combined to pump up growth in the second quarter. Those effects won’t last, and economists expect growth to slow in the second half of the year. Pretty much no one outside the White House thinks a growth rate of 4 percent is sustainable in the long term. Still, recent data does suggest that the pace of growth has picked up this year. Some economists think full-year growth in gross domestic product could hit 3 percent in 2018 for the first time since 2005. “The bottom line is that the economy is doing better,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist for the accounting firm Grant Thornton. "
967,"SAN FRANCISCO — The finger-pointing over the scuttled $44 billion transaction between the chip makers Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors has begun. Richard Clemmer, chief executive of NXP, had some harsh words on Thursday for officials in China over the deal’s collapse amid a trade war between Washington and Beijing. The acquisition was terminated after it failed to secure regulatory approval from Chinese authorities before a deadline set by the companies at midnight Eastern time on Wednesday. In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Clemmer said Chinese authorities gave no explanation for withholding approval for the transaction. He said that there were no government requirements or regulations that the deal did not meet, adding that Qualcomm and NXP had both agreed to undisclosed concessions to address antitrust concerns raised by Chinese authorities. “For the issues they raised, remedies were provided and they agreed on those remedies,” Mr. Clemmer said of Chinese officials. “There was no clear explanation of why they wouldn’t approve it.” Mr. Clemmer and NXP had tried for nearly two years to get the deal done. In 2016, Qualcomm and NXP had struck an agreement to combine. But the transaction could not be completed until it had obtained regulatory approval from nine jurisdictions. Eight of those, including the United States, had approved the deal; China had been the lone holdout. The situation was complicated by the Trump administration’s recent trade moves, including placing tariffs on numerous Chinese goods. Trade experts said Chinese authorities appeared to be withholding approval of the Qualcomm and NXP deal to gain negotiating leverage in retaliation. "
968,"A federal judge in Oregon issued a ruling this week in favor of transgender students, saying that forcing them to use restrooms that correspond with the gender they were assigned at birth would violate civil rights law. In a 56-page opinion released Tuesday, Judge Marco A. Hernández of Federal District Court in Portland said that transgender students should be allowed to use bathrooms that match the gender they identify with. The ruling upheld the policy of a school district in Dallas, Ore., that allowed a male transgender student to use the boys’ restrooms, showers and locker rooms. The judge dismissed claims by some students and parents saying that other male students experienced “embarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, intimidation, fear, apprehension and stress produced by using the restroom with students of the opposite sex.” Judge Hernández wrote in his opinion, “Forcing transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity would undoubtedly harm those students and prevent them from equally accessing educational opportunities and resources.” An evolving battle over transgender rights is taking place across the country, and it has been waged most prominently over access to school bathrooms. In 2016, North Carolina legislators ignited a nationwide controversy when they passed a law requiring people in publicly owned buildings to use the restroom that corresponded with the gender they were assigned at birth. "
969,"WASHINGTON — For years, President Trump has used Twitter as his go-to public relations weapon, mounting a barrage of attacks on celebrities and then political rivals even after advisers warned he could be creating legal problems for himself. Those concerns now turn out to be well founded. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is scrutinizing tweets and negative statements from the president about Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, according to three people briefed on the matter. Several of the remarks came as Mr. Trump was also privately pressuring the men — both key witnesses in the inquiry — about the investigation, and Mr. Mueller is examining whether the actions add up to attempts to obstruct the investigation by both intimidating witnesses and pressuring senior law enforcement officials to tamp down the inquiry. Mr. Mueller wants to question the president about the tweets. His interest in them is the latest addition to a range of presidential actions he is investigating as a possible obstruction case: private interactions with Mr. Comey, Mr. Sessions and other senior administration officials about the Russia inquiry; misleading White House statements; public attacks; and possible pardon offers to potential witnesses. None of what Mr. Mueller has homed in on constitutes obstruction, Mr. Trump’s lawyers said. They argued that most of the presidential acts under scrutiny, including the firing of Mr. Comey, fall under Mr. Trump’s authority as the head of the executive branch and insisted that he should not even have to answer Mr. Mueller’s questions about obstruction. But privately, some of the lawyers have expressed concern that Mr. Mueller will stitch together several episodes, encounters and pieces of evidence, like the tweets, to build a case that the president embarked on a broad effort to interfere with the investigation. Prosecutors who lack one slam-dunk piece of evidence in obstruction cases often search for a larger pattern of behavior, legal experts said. "
970,"As an economist who shares President Trump’s belief that we should be cutting taxes and shrinking government, I might be expected to be enthralled by his policies. But that is not the sentiment I and many other libertarians feel when it comes to his decision to impose tariffs on steel, aluminum and a host of other products made overseas, particularly in China. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said they had reached an agreement to step back from a trade war and to discuss ways to lower tariffs and other trade barriers, and possibly increase European imports of American soybeans. But the outcome of those talks is far from certain, and trade tensions between the United States and China remain very high. What is driving the president’s apparent eagerness to impose tariffs is a simple and wrongheaded idea that plays to a large part of his base: A trade war will spur job growth in America. He is trying to use tariffs to give a leg up to American industries against countries that manufacture the same products that we do — whether steel, aluminum or cars — but more efficiently. And who could be against that if it creates more jobs? In reality, however, creating jobs alone does not make for a strong economy. What we really want is to increase production. And to achieve that, we need to allocate labor as efficiently as possible. One way to do that is to ensure that if other countries can make certain goods more efficiently than we can, we trade with them for these items, rather than manufacture them ourselves. The result is cheaper goods, which is to our advantage. But tariffs do nothing to improve this efficient allocation of labor. They also do not increase or decrease employment. They just shift jobs around, and almost always in a manner that hurts the economy. As an illustration, assume Mr. Trump is the governor of New York. He is devoted to making the Empire State “great again.” Right now, both New Yorkers and Iowans raise pigs — but Iowa produces far more than New York. So Governor Trump sets up a protective tariff against the importation of Iowa-raised pork. Will this make New York great again? "
971,"On Feb. 12, 1946, Tech. Sgt. Isaac Woodard Jr. boarded a bus in Georgia to return home to his wife in South Carolina after completing service in New Guinea and the Philippines. During the ride, Woodard, who was black, asked the bus driver if he would have time to “take a piss” at the next stop. The driver, objecting to Woodard’s language, said, “Boy, go on back and sit down and keep quiet and don’t be talking out so loud.” Fresh from serving his country in wartime, the soldier shot back: “Goddamn it, talk to me like I’m talking to you. I’m a man just like you.” An hour later during a scheduled stop in Batesburg, S.C., the incensed bus driver called over local law-enforcement officers, telling them that the soldier’s foul mouth offended a white female passenger. The police confronted Woodard and dragged him out of sight of the other passengers to unleash a barrage of baton strikes and punches to the face that ruptured his eyeballs. Still in uniform, he was taken to jail and held overnight. The next morning, his eyesight now permanently gone, the police gave him a hot towel and some eye drops and left him at the nearest veterans’ hospital. Woodard survived war overseas only to be blinded by the war at home. Civil rights leaders met with President Harry Truman seven months later to encourage him to end lynch-mob violence against black Americans. After hearing stories of a black veteran and his wife who were executed in a hail of bullets in Georgia, another mutilated with a meat cleaver and blowtorch in Louisiana and the violent blinding of Woodard, Truman’s face fell pale. He rose from his chair and exclaimed: “My God! I had no idea it was as terrible as that! We’ve got to do something!” The next day Truman informed his attorney general that policy was needed to prevent lynchings and, in December, Truman created the President’s Committee on Civil Rights to look into racial violence and civil rights. A year later, the committee published its report proposing a number of reforms, including the abolishment of poll taxes, anti-lynching legislation and exempting members of the armed forces from segregation within the military and in society at-large. Though anti-lynching legislation died in Congress and the poll tax was deemed a constitutional issue, Truman could act on the desegregation of the armed forces on his own. July 26 marks the 70th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9981, Truman’s landmark directive to desegregate the United States military — and the signature achievement of his nascent civil rights program. He declared it was his administration’s policy that “there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed services without regard to race, color, religion or national origin.” Truman took this action despite significant resistance from defense leadership. Kenneth Royall, then secretary of the Army, argued that the Army shouldn’t be used as an “instrument of social evolution.” The Marine Corps commandant, Clifton Cates, complained that “the problem of segregation is not the responsibility of the Armed Forces but is a problem of the nation,” and that it was dangerous to use the military to change the nation’s racial politics. Overruling the Pentagon, Truman employed the military in a racial-desegregation social experiment in hopes of improving the American one. His use of executive powers signaled a commitment to a more inclusive version of the United States. Fast forward to today, and President Donald Trump is also using the military to practice his version of racial politics. The last several months have seen the Trump administration come under fire for its policies allowing the deportation of undocumented veterans under certain circumstances, undocumented family members of active-duty military personnel and the discharge of immigrants serving in the military hoping to earn citizenship. Trump has deployed the National Guard to the nation’s southern border in response to crossings by asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants, proclaiming, “Until we can have a wall and proper security, we’re going to be guarding our border with the military.” He has even proposed using the military’s budget to pay for the wall. And after facing significant backlash for his zero-tolerance immigration policy that separated migrant children from their parents, he signed an executive order to stop the practice and directed immigrant families be interned on military bases instead. Though some of these actions are not unique to Trump, they cannot be divorced from his rhetoric on immigrants of color throughout his campaign and presidency. The approaches by Truman and Trump are representative of a larger truth: If you want to know what a president believes, examine his use of the military. This is not just a question of national security and international relations; it’s reflected in domestic issues like race relations, gender equality and L.G.B.T.Q. rights. Often to the chagrin of defense leaders, presidents have used the military to test-run preferred social policies because congressional approval isn’t required, making implementation easier. The decision to use the military to advocate for social policy never occurs in a vacuum and is rarely the result of personal politics alone. The military is an effective vehicle within the commander in chief’s direct authority that can help make the case to the country and demonstrate responsiveness to specific constituencies. "
972,"July 26 marks the 70th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9981, President Harry Truman’s directive to desegregate the United States military. To commemorate the milestone, Theodore Johnson compares Truman’s strategic use of the military to make the country more inclusive to President Trump’s politics that equate immigrations with national security and has stoked racial tensions on a national scale. Both approaches demonstrate that the military is an effective vehicle for pushing broader social policies and influencing the mood of the United States. "
973,"The filmmaker Michael Moore’s movie “Fahrenheit 11/9,” about the presidency of Donald Trump, is scheduled to open in September. His nonfiction show, “Michael Moore TV Nation,” will have its premiere on TBS in October. But first there’s the 14th annual Traverse City Film Festival in Michigan, from July 31 to Aug. 5. Mr. Moore founded the festival and movies, and honorees have his imprint. For the 2016 festival, all of the selections from the United States were directed by women. (“I just wanted to make the statement that 2 to 4 percent of the films made by Hollywood are made by women,” he said. “That’s just wrong.”) In 2017, the festival showcased work by filmmakers from countries affected by the Trump administration’s travel ban. The documentary filmmaker Barbara Kopple won a “Mid-Life Achievement” award in 2014; this year, Jane Fonda will receive a Lifetime Achievement Award. (Mr. Moore won an Academy Award for best documentary feature  in 2003 for “Bowling for Columbine.”) Many of the films are shown at the State Theater and the theater Bijou by the Bay, both renovated under Mr. Moore’s direction and run by the festival. Both show first-run features and the State offers 25-cent morning movies (classics like “The Band Wagon” and  “Anatomy of a Murder”). The popcorn recipe is Mr. Moore’s. He lives within walking distance of the theaters and seems to be everywhere during the festival (I was in the audience one summer for a late-night showing of “The Shining,” for which his introduction was both scholarly and hilarious.) Here, edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Moore. What inspired you to renovate the State movie theater and start a film festival in Traverse City? My family had vacationed up there every summer; we’d rent a cabin somewhere, and then we decided to build a cabin and live there full time. I had been there for about three years and was constantly going by this boarded-up movie theater. They had kept it climate-controlled, they had patched the roof. There was no leaking, there was no mold; it was in pretty decent shape for a 100-year old theater. I said this thing shouldn’t be closed, this should be open. "
974,"A heavily funded Democratic group will spend tens of millions of dollars to mobilize voters in the Republican-leaning states where control of the Senate is likely to be decided this November, stepping in to fill a void left by years of decay in Democratic infrastructure at the state and local level. Senate Majority PAC, the principal “super PAC” supporting Democratic efforts to capture the chamber, intends to steer at least $20 million into the voter-mobilization campaign ahead of the midterm elections, officials with the group confirmed. The program, which follows a similar — successful — Democratic effort in Alabama last year, underscores the degree to which outside groups that can take massive donations have supplanted the traditional role of political parties. The initiative by Senate Majority PAC — which will run through an affiliated nonprofit group, Majority Forward — will span more than a dozen states where Senate seats are at stake. But it is to focus on four states above all: Missouri and Indiana, where endangered Democrats are seeking re-election, and Arizona and Tennessee, where strong Democratic challengers are running for open seats currently held by Republicans. Those four races are among the country’s most competitive. And for Democrats to take control of the Senate, they would likely have to win at least three of them, or perhaps all four, depending on the outcome of races in other states. Republicans currently hold the Senate by a slim majority, with 51 seats, but Democrats are largely on defense this year because so many of their senators in red states are running for new terms. Paul Dunn, a strategist for Senate Majority PAC, said that in those four states, Democrats need both to drive up turnout among left-leaning voters and to make inroads in more conservative communities. "
975,"About 700 teenage conservatives visited the nation’s capital this week for a four-day leadership conference organized by Turning Point USA, a group founded in 2012 to promote activism skills among high school and college students and help young conservatives network with leaders in the movement. Many of the biggest names in the Trump administration and conservative activist circles, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions (who echoed the crowd’s chants of “lock her up” during his speech to the conference on Tuesday), former White House spokesman Sean Spicer, Donald Trump Jr. and billionaire Mark Cuban, led sessions at the conference about battling liberal college bias, opposing big government, protecting the Second Amendment and promoting free markets. We sat down with a few attendees to hear what it’s like for them to be red in schools they say are overwhelmingly blue. The interviews have been edited for clarity and brevity. Daniel Jakob, 15, is a high school student from Tenafly, N.J. Why are you here? The mainstream media makes it seem like the left is winning, but being here and seeing all these conservatives, it lets me know I’m not the only young conservative here. It’s nice to be with a group of people I can relate to while at the same time contributing to the cause to further endorse conservatism. What does “conservative” mean to you? I’m a conservative because I believe the government should be fair and that the Constitution shall not be infringed. Where I live in North New Jersey, to get a license for a gun is really difficult. Without a gun in your house, you’re vulnerable, and not just from terrorists or criminals but also from the government, because the whole point of the Constitution is to protect us from the government. Things like gun control that the left are trying to implement, that’s what they’re trying to take away, the right to protect ourselves. Are your classmates also conservative, or are you an outlier? A majority of kids in my high school are liberal. I do know a few conservative kids. All my teachers are very liberal. Whenever I’m in a class and I share my political opinion, I’m basically the bigot, that’s what I’m called. In my literature class we were reading “1984,” and my teacher compared “1984” to President Trump’s America, and when I refuted that, the class just shut me down. "
976,"Ken Kurson is a confidant of Rudolph W. Giuliani. He is a onetime speechwriter for Donald J. Trump. And he is a close friend of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, who appointed Mr. Kurson to run his weekly newspaper, The New York Observer. This spring, those relationships appeared to yield a prestigious offer from the Trump White House: a seat on the board of the National Endowment for the Humanities, a federal body that doles out millions of dollars a year in grants to cultural institutions. First, Mr. Kurson had to undergo a government background check. As part of that process, the Federal Bureau of Investigation learned about allegations that he had harassed a New York doctor in 2015, according to Mount Sinai Hospital, where the doctor worked. In late spring, the F.B.I. interviewed Mount Sinai doctors and others about the alleged harassment, according to several people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to discuss a delicate situation. The female doctor had become so worried that Mount Sinai arranged for someone to accompany her to and from the hospital for at least a few days, two of the people said. “In November 2015, Mount Sinai began an investigation into allegations of harassment made by two of our doctors against Ken Kurson,” the hospital said in a statement. “We also took measures to protect our staff and the alleged harassment ceased shortly thereafter. We are cooperating with the F.B.I. on their current background check of Mr. Kurson.” Mr. Kurson said in an interview last week that he withdrew from consideration for the government post around early June, citing the amount of paperwork involved in the vetting process. "
977,"On a hazy day in early February, some of the most powerful men in India’s government gathered at Chhatrasal Stadium in New Delhi, an arena famous for its boisterous wrestling bouts. The men had come for a different kind of spectacle — a biographical film epic, whose initial episodes (out of 57 total) would be shown for the first time that evening. At the center of a makeshift stage, surrounded by smiling politicians and cabinet members, was the person whose life was being celebrated: a slender figure in saffron robes with a long, dark beard, his chest-length hair tied in a bun. He needed no introduction. This was Baba Ramdev, one of the most famous men in India. Ramdev took the microphone and introduced the phalanx of several hundred Hindu religious students, known as brahmacharis, sitting in neat rows on the field. Everyone repeat after me: “Bharat mata ki jai!” he shouted. The crowd raised their arms and pumped their fists as they chanted the words — “India my motherland is great” — that have become a defining slogan of the Hindu nationalist movement. One by one, the dignitaries rose to recount Ramdev’s extraordinary career: how he brought physical fitness to the Indian middle class with his mass yoga camps and television empire; how he built his medicine-and-consumer-goods company, Patanjali Ayurved, into a multibillion-dollar colossus. “Swamiji has changed the direction of the world, the thinking of the world,” one speaker shouted, referring to Ramdev with an affectionate honorific. “That is how great he is. Swamiji has changed India, which was going toward the West — its dress and food and culture — and has changed its direction to yoga!” At last silence fell, and the 50-foot screen flickered to life. For the next hour, India’s political elite watched in humble silence as Ramdev’s life unfolded, from his birth in a remote rural village to his early days as a lissome yogi (the remaining episodes had been condensed into trailer form). As a film, it was a shambolic melodrama that seemed to treat Ramdev almost as a divine messenger. But as an expression of the Indian public’s feelings, it wasn’t far off the mark. Ramdev has been compared to Billy Graham, the Southern Baptist firebrand who advised several American presidents and energized the Christian right. The parallel makes some sense: Ramdev has been a prominent voice on the Hindu right, and his tacit endorsement during the landmark 2014 campaign helped bring Prime Minister Narendra Modi to power. He appeared alongside Modi on several occasions, singing the leader’s praises and urging Indians to turn out for him. Ramdev has called Modi “a close friend,” and the prime minister publicly lauds Patanjali’s array of ayurvedic products — medicines, cosmetics and foodstuffs. Although Modi campaigned heavily on promises to reform India’s economy and fight corruption, there were frequent dog whistles to the Hindu nationalist base, some of them coordinated with Ramdev. A month before Modi’s landslide victory, a trust controlled by Ramdev released a video in which senior leaders of Modi’s party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (B.J.P.), including the current ministers of foreign affairs, internal security, finance and transportation, appeared alongside him with a signed document setting out nine pledges. These included the protection of cows — animals held sacred in Hinduism — and a broad call for Hindu nationalist reforms of the government, the courts, cultural institutions and education. After Modi won, Ramdev claimed to have “prepared the ground for the big political changes that occurred.” "
978,"At the Rally to Restore Sanity in 2010, Jon Stewart delivered a funny political speech to a crowd of his fans on the mall in Washington, D.C. He praised reasonableness, compromise and the virtue of working together with our opponents. Insanity however proved resilient. Last month, he told an audience that it was an error to mistake cultural power for real power, adding: “I, being a part of that machine and mechanism, do feel oddly culpable.” For Mr. Stewart, who more than anyone elevated the political stature of the late-night talk show, to make such a concession is jarring. But it fits the mood right now, one defined not by the army of his television successors but by the Australian stand-up Hannah Gadsby. Her ferocious special “Nanette” tapped into a growing cultural anxiety about the limits of comedy. She skewered the nature of jokes, arguing that because they inevitably lead to incomplete stories, they evade difficult truths. [Hannah Gadsby on the toll of performing “Nanette.”] The media gravitated to her bracingly categorical argument. Slate announced that “Nanette” was evidence that comedy was “broken,” and a Vulture review concluded from her argument that jokes “can’t really challenge or change anything — and are therefore more conservative than progressive.” Such critiques are just as common in the conservative media. Reviewing Sacha Baron Cohen’s new series, “Who Is America?,” a critic for The Federalist lamented, “Comedy is supposed to connect us as humans. Now it’s tearing us apart.” When did comedy become the worst medicine? It is a relatively new development. Until recently, comedy had been rapidly expanding, increasingly co-opting areas of our culture previously dominated by sober voices. One of the most memorable responses to the Sept. 11 attacks was David Letterman’s emotional on-air speech processing his grief, which set a precedent for talk-show hosts offering healing words after national tragedies. Corporations and business schools now regularly hire troupes like Second City to teach them how the principles of improv can help their bottom line. But the role of comedy has particularly moved into the political sphere. Before he left the series in 2015, Mr. Stewart’s “Daily Show” was a trusted news source for many young people, frequently earning him comparisons to Walter Cronkite, and political analysis with funny quips became part of the nightly ritual of comedy. When Sarah Silverman spoke alongside then-Senator Al Franken at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, the fact that a onetime comedian and a current one were playing roles at the highest level of presidential politics didn’t even seem notable. "
979,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. The U.S.-E.U. trade war halts, scientists discover water on Mars and a new exhibition showcases Gala Dalí’s life. Here’s the latest: • The U.S. trade war with the E.U. appears to be off, at least for now. At a surprise news conference, President Trump and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, above left, said they would work toward lowering tariffs and other trade barriers, temporarily defusing a battle that began with Mr. Trump’s tariffs on European steel and aluminum exports. Given Mr. Trump’s unpredictable negotiating style, it was not clear whether the agreement was a genuine truce or merely a lull in a conflict that could flare again. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump’s tariffs may be starting to hurt the Big 3 automakers in Detroit, all of whom revised their financial forecasts downward, sending their shares down sharply. _____ "
980,"KNOXVILLE, Iowa — Today President Trump is visiting Dubuque, Iowa, where every year at harvest time, millions of tons of grain come via rail and truck to be loaded onto barges on the Mississippi River and shipped to Mexico, China and much of the rest of the world. Harvest puts coin into the hands of farmers, and they and their communities — indeed all of America — profit. Not this year. The president is here to trumpet a $12 billion plan to aid American farmers. Why do they need aid? For Iowans, it’s because 33 percent of our economy is tied, directly or indirectly, to agriculture, and Mr. Trump recklessly opened trade wars that will hit “Trump country” — rural America — hardest and that have already brought an avalanche of losses. Indeed, the impact of his tariffs will probably be felt by family farms and the area for generations. So perhaps visiting Dubuque is the least he could do. The cost of being shut out of overseas markets for soybeans, beef, pork, chicken and more will be in the billions. Once those markets are gone, they will be difficult to recover. Commodity prices continue to drop, and good weather suggests an excellent crop is in the making, which will drive prices further down. Brazil is ready to step in with increased soybean production, and China has already shifted its purchasing power there. But the fallout will not just be tallied in statistics. In farm country, U.S.A., the Trump tariffs have poured gas on what has been a slow-burning conflagration. Rural America is about to undergo a major demographic shift. President Trump didn’t start it, but he has accelerated a crisis that might have taken a generation or two to play out. Now it might take only a few years. "
981,"Nov. 4, 2020 In the end, a bitterly fought election came down to the old political aphorism, popularized during Bill Clinton’s successful 1992 run against George H.W. Bush: “It’s the economy, stupid.” This time, however, it was the Republican incumbent, not his Democratic challenger, who benefited from that truism. Donald J. Trump has been decisively re-elected as president of the United States, winning every state he carried in 2016 and adding Nevada, even as he once again failed, albeit narrowly, to gain a majority of the popular vote. Extraordinary turnout in California, New York, Illinois and other Democratic bastions could not compensate for the president’s abiding popularity in the states that still decide who gets to live in the White House: Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida. Yet, unlike 2016, last night’s outcome came neither as a political upset nor as a global shock. Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have consistently polled ahead of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and her running mate, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, since July. The New York Times correctly predicted the outcome of the race in every state, another marked change from 2016. In exit poll interviews, Mr. Trump’s supporters frequently cited the state of the economy to explain their vote. “What part of Dow 30,000 do the liberals not understand?” Kevin O’Reilly of Manchester, N.H., told The Times. Senators Warren and Brown never seemed to find a compelling answer to that question, despite an economy that continues to struggle with painfully slow wage growth, spiraling budget deficits and multiplying trade wars that have hurt businesses as diverse as Ohio soybean farmers and California chipmakers. "
982,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump welcomed “a new phase in the relationship between the United States and the European Union” on Wednesday, after reaching an agreement to hold off on imposing further tariffs and to work toward dropping existing ones on steel and aluminum. Mr. Trump made the announcement in the Rose Garden with the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. (Not in attendance: A CNN reporter who was barred for what the White House deemed “inappropriate” questions.) The U.S. has already imposed billions of dollars in tariffs on European products for what the Trump administration has labeled unfair trade practices, raising costs for American companies and consumers. • Separately, the federal budget deficit is growing much faster than economists had predicted, in part because the amount of corporate taxes collected by the federal government has fallen after the tax overhaul. "
983,"Corporate earnings are the strongest they have been in years. Headline numbers suggest the economy is doing pretty well under President Trump. The stock market, however, is starting to signal that the good times might not last for many. On the surface, stocks look to be performing well. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index is up more than 6 percent this year, and it is close to getting back to the historic high it hit earlier this year. A deeper look, however, suggests there is increasing concern among stock investors. A small group of the largest technology companies has driven much of the recent rally. The stocks of other types of companies have not performed nearly as well, in part because of worries that Mr. Trump’s tariffs will harm corporate profits. The stock market is not a perfect predictor of the future, but the lackluster performance of a large part of it may portend a difficult period for many companies in which they pull back on their businesses and perhaps shed jobs in the process. The trade talks announced on Wednesday between the United States and the European Union could prevent an escalation of the fight between the two trading partners. Some investors have been betting that Mr. Trump’s bellicose stance was a bargaining tactic. Stocks jumped after news of the talks was reported. But a joint statement from the United States and the European Union merely laid out their intentions to talk and did not provide many details. Failure to make progress in negotiations with the European Union and continued tensions with China could dampen investors’ spirits. "
984,"Even as corporate America has unleashed insatiable consumer demand for innovative low-cost goods and technology, it has driven economic trends that continue to increase inequality, stall wage growth and strengthen the power of business. That in the face of this onslaught Republicans now control the White House, both branches of Congress, both legislative branches in 32 states and the Supreme Court is a testament to the continuing electoral liabilities of the Democratic Party and the vulnerable spots of the liberal agenda. Nearly half the country’s voters support a president who embraces upwardly redistributive policies that many of them do not benefit from. Why? Because on race, religion, abortion, LGBTQ rights and immigration, President Trump — unlike previous Republican presidents — has given his voters exactly what they want. This is patently true in the case of immigration. As The Washington Post reported in June, “The Trump administration has ramped up arrests of illegal immigrants, slashed refugee programs, criminalized unauthorized border crossings” and secured a ban on travelers from six majority-Muslim nations. But recent scholarly research shows how the interests of those on top of the economic pyramid are gaining strength. "
985,"Good Thursday morning. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.) The latest earnings report suggests its scandals are finally starting to hurt. Growth in users and advertising has slowed, and the company doesn’t expect its figures to improve quickly, especially as it spends more on privacy and security. Facebook’s stock tumbled more than 23 percent in after-hours trading. That wiped $120 billion off the company’s market value — and $17 billion off Mark Zuckerberg’s. The earnings conference call was dramatic, too, Barron’s reports. Particularly when one of the analysts on the line — Ross Sandler of Barclays — translated a forecast of revenue growth declining “by high-single-digit percentages from prior quarters sequentially” into a drop to “around 20 percent by the fourth quarter of this year.” Daniel Ives of GBH Insights counsels calm: Shira Ovide at Bloomberg Opinion doesn’t agree: Nor does Dan Gallagher at Heard on the Street: Elsewhere in technology: Facebook faces more Senate questioning in September over foreign interference, the WSJ reports, alongside Google and Twitter.

Rao in London. ____________________________ President Trump and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said after a meeting yesterday that they would work toward lowering tariffs and other barriers. The Europeans also agreed to buy more American soybeans and natural gas. "
986,"When President Trump met with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, at the White House, the two said they were entering a new phase in their relationship. Crucial to that will be natural gas. Demand for natural gas — a cleaner-burning fossil fuel than coal or oil — is rising worldwide, and the United States is a growing supplier of liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G. The European Union, meanwhile, wants to diversify its energy supply, which remains somewhat dependent on Russia, with which it has a difficult relationship. Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that the 28-nation European Union would be “a massive buyer of L.N.G.,” before adding, “We have plenty of it.” Any such shift won’t happen overnight, though. In simple terms: Europe’s consumption of natural gas is increasing, and its domestic production is falling. Its imports have risen rapidly in recent years, and will most likely increase further in the future. “The question is: Where will these increased imports come from?” said Marco Alverà, chief executive of SNAM, an Italian natural gas infrastructure company. Many of the region’s power plants are switching from being fired by coal, which has high levels of carbon emissions, to running on gas, which is significantly better for the environment (though not entirely clean). "
987,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Millions of people from across the world visit Yosemite National Park each year for an opportunity to take in the sweeping vistas at one of America’s most treasured natural preserves. But hundreds of visitors were ordered to evacuate the park Wednesday as firefighters struggled to contain the encroaching 38,000-acre Ferguson Fire, which has roared for nearly two weeks and remains just 25 percent contained. Dry conditions have made it difficult for firefighters to contain the flames. “The conditions are incredibly strenuous, and we’re seeing triple-digit temperatures in places,” said Dan McKeague, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service. “Some sections are extremely remote. Access is limited because there aren’t a ton of existing roads.” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at U.C.L.A., said that long-term drying caused by rising global temperatures has exacerbated the risk of wildfires in the western United States. “Over decades there has been a trend toward less moisture in the soil and forest, and that is affecting how dry the vegetation is becoming in summer,” he said. Mr. Swain said the drought several years ago and resulting bark beetle infestations in forests have combined with rising temperatures to create difficult conditions for containing wildfires. Scott Gediman, a park ranger and spokesman for the National Park Service, said the last major closing because of fire at Yosemite was in 1990 during the A-rock Fire. A flood in 1997 closed the park for about two and a half months, he said, and since then there have been partial closings every so often. "
988,"LAHORE, Pakistan — Imran Khan, a charismatic cricket star who has fiercely criticized American counterterrorism policy in a region plagued by extremism, appeared poised on Thursday to become Pakistan’s next prime minister. After preliminary results showed his party decisively ahead in an election that critics say was deeply marred, Mr. Khan addressed the nation on television, outlining what he would do as prime minister. He said he would fight corruption at the highest levels, improve relations with China, seek a “mutually beneficial” relationship with the United States and create a just welfare state along the lines of what the Prophet Muhammad did centuries ago. “We’re going to run Pakistan in a way it’s never been run before,” he said. He also said he would never live in the prime minister’s mansion. In a country of so many poor people, he said, “I would be embarrassed” to stay in such a house. For years, Mr. Khan had tried but failed to take the reins of this nuclear-armed Islamic republic, which has struggled with poverty, economic stagnation and instability and which is increasingly torn between its two biggest allies: China and the United States. But this time around, he found a powerful ally in Pakistan’s military. In recent months, army and intelligence officers pressured, threatened and blackmailed politicians from rival parties, human rights groups have said, steadily thinning out Mr. Khan’s competition. "
989,"BRUSSELS — When he arrived in the Oval Office for negotiations over their growing trade war, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, brought a small gift for President Trump, a renowned admirer of military commanders. It was a photograph of the cemetery in Luxembourg where Gen. George S. Patton is buried. Mr. Juncker, a wily, if often maligned, former prime minister of tiny Luxembourg, added an inscription, alluding to the shared sacrifice of Americans and Europeans during World War II. “Dear Donald,’’ it read. “Let us remember our common history.” Mr. Juncker left the Oval Office on Wednesday with a deal — or at least a truce — that for the moment has defused the Trump administration’s growing trade war with Brussels, while bringing relief across Europe, especially in Germany. Yet if Europe’s political and business leaders are cautiously optimistic that an economic crisis has been averted, they are also wary, given their history with Mr. Trump in the 18 months since he has taken office. Even as Mr. Trump cast the meeting on Wednesday as a great success, and offered gratitude to Mr. Juncker, the question is whether the deal represents a meaningful improvement in the severely strained trans-Atlantic alliance, or is simply another example of the unpredictable approach of a president who has spent months mocking and undermining European leaders — even describing the European bloc as a “foe.” “The question is, how much do you give in to a bully?” asked Maria Demertzis, the deputy director of Bruegel, an economic research institute in Brussels. “This could just be perfunctory, and if it just stops extra tariffs, that’s fine. But you can’t really depend on Trump. His understanding of global trade is bilateral balance, which is as good as arbitrary, given global supply chains. And it depends on what side of the bed he wakes up on tomorrow.” "
990,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The first Michael Cohen-Donald Trump tape is a bit of a black box. It’s not clear exactly what either one is saying or what they mean. We now know that President Trump and his aides have repeatedly lied about the efforts to cover up an alleged affair he had with a former Playboy model. Almost everything else — including whether the tape creates new legal problems for Trump — is unknown at this point. For anyone trying to follow this story, I’d offer one overarching tip: You should put zero weight on the claims made by Trump and his team, including Rudy Giuliani. They have shown that they’re willing to lie whenever it suits their cause. Giuliani’s earlier description of the Cohen-Trump tape — from just six days ago — now appears laughably inaccurate. I am not saying that Trump and Giuliani are always lying. When the truth helps them, they speak it. But the mere fact that they make a claim shouldn’t alter anyone’s judgment about its likely veracity. Related, from The Washington Post: “The government has seized more than 100 recordings that Cohen made of his conversations with people discussing matters that could relate to Trump and his businesses and with Trump himself talking.” Georgia. The Cook Political Report yesterday upgraded the chances of Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia. The Republican, Brian Kemp, is still favored, Jennifer Duffy of The Cook Political Report writes, but only modestly, because he’s an extreme candidate who may turn off swing voters. One statistic in Duffy’s piece captures why Kemp remains favored. Abrams generated enormous excitement in the primary. She’s an appealing candidate — the first female African-American gubernatorial nominee in any state — with an uplifting message. When I watched her victory speech on primary night, I thought I might be witnessing a new national star. And yet for all the excitement about Abrams, turnout in the Republican primary was still higher than in the Democratic primary. In fact, more Republicans voted in this week’s runoff — won by Kemp — than Democrats voted in the original primary. There are simply more Republican than Democratic voters in Georgia. Yes, Abrams can significantly improve her chances by turning out even more progressives — especially younger and nonwhite voters — in the general election. But she almost certainly needs to win over some traditional Republican voters too. The extreme nature of Kemp’s campaign should help. So should her populist message. It’s a fascinating race. “Wait a second, you might be thinking, Hillary Clinton lost Georgia by only 5 percentage points in 2016. And Georgia has been getting bluer. Is Abrams’s climb really that steep? Yes, it is,” Perry Bacon Jr. wrote for FiveThirtyEight earlier this year. You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook.

991,"The former cricket great Imran Khan is on the verge of becoming prime minister of Pakistan. Innumerable jocks have turned into politicians around the world, starting from the high school quarterback who is elected class president. But the confluence of all-time great athlete and head of government represented by Khan is rare. If you don’t follow the sport, you might not know that Khan was not merely a garden-variety professional athlete, but was probably the greatest cricketer ever from Pakistan, a country where cricket is by far the dominant sport. He is also one of the sport’s best ever all-rounders, players who can both bat and bowl well. Now on the cusp of the top office in the land, he is looking for a rarely achieved double. Among those who have served in high office around the world are Lasse Viren (four track gold medals, Finland parliament), Sebastian Coe (two track gold medals, M.P., now Lord Coe), Vitali Klitschko (heavyweight champion, mayor of Kiev), Manny Pacquiao (multiple boxing championships, Philippines senate), Romário (World Cup Golden Ball, Brazil senator), and Ilie Nastase (tennis star, Romanian senate). But none of them were presidents or prime ministers. The closest to achieving what Khan is poised to achieve may be George Weah, a productive striker who was the winner of soccer’s highest award, the Ballon d’Or, in 1995, playing for A.C. Milan. Last year, he was elected president of Liberia. He and Khan sit at the top of the pile for now. At least until LeBron James, Usain Bolt or Roger Federer takes a shot at high office. In the United States, you could almost fill a Congress with former pro athletes who have served: Their numbers have included the A.F.L. quarterback Jack Kemp, who was also a vice-presidential nominee. He was joined as a legislator by the baseball Hall of Famer Jim Bunning; the basketball superstar Bill Bradley; the decathlete Bob Mathias; football stars Steve Largent, J.C. Watts, Jon Runyan and Heath Shuler; Tom McMillen of the N.B.A.; and the sprinter Ralph Metcalfe, among many others. "
992,"On Wednesday, a federal district court made history. Judge Peter J. Messitte of Maryland allowed a lawsuit to move forward against President Trump, alleging that he is violating the Constitution by continuing to do business with foreign and domestic governments. In doing so, he became the first federal judge ever to rule on the meaning of the word “emolument” in the Constitution. Coverage of the lawsuit, which was brought by two of us (with the third, Mr. Eisen, among the co-counsels), has sometimes cast doubt on the usefulness of the Emoluments Clauses, which we have argued forbid presidents from using their office to “profit, gain or advantage.” Critics have noted how rarely they have been deployed. That’s why Judge Messitte’s ruling is so important: It opens a path to enforcement of the ethics regime that the framers developed as a bulwark against corruption in the highest office in the land. The decision could not be more timely. As our suit makes clear, the head of the executive branch of our government is more embroiled in commercial activities, from his hotel near the White House to business deals half a world away, than any president in American history. The Foreign Emoluments Clause — specifically, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of the Constitution — declares that “no Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.” The Domestic Emoluments Clause — Article II, Section 1, Clause 7 — states that “The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.” By ruling that the word “emolument” in these clauses means “profit,” “gain” or “advantage” in essentially any form from a foreign or domestic government, Judge Messitte has correctly found a way to enforce the framers’ anti-corruption mechanism. The framers understood the potential corrosive influence of commercial profit in the executive and wrote the Constitution “against a background of profound concern” regarding “possible foreign influence upon the president (and, to be sure, upon other federal officials),” as Judge Messitte noted. They designed the Emoluments Clauses as a prophylactic measure to prevent actual corruption and the specter of corruption — where a foreign power (or a domestic government) buys favorable policy decisions by engaging with the head of the executive branch commercially, outside the normal avenues of state. "
993,"GRANITE CITY, Ill. — President Trump came to a newly revived steel mill here on Thursday to take credit for jobs created by American tariffs against China and other steel exporters. But his triumphal message was muddied by the woes of Midwestern soybean farmers, who have been caught in the crossfire of Mr. Trump’s multifront trade war. “To see an old big monster plant like this reopening, that is a great honor,” he declared to a raucous crowd, clad in a mix of hard hats and “Make America Great Again” baseball caps. “The days of plundering American jobs and wealth — those days are over.” “I could be one of you,” the president added. “I’d be happy if I was, because you’re opening up plants all over the country.” Mr. Trump introduced his daughter Ivanka, who congratulated the workers at the plant, where the owner, United States Steel Corporation, has begun firing up the second of two blast furnaces after a long shutdown. Then, she thanked her father for “enabling it to happen.” At the Granite City Works on Thursday, Donald J. Trump was the only thing bigger than U.S. Steel. With his obligatory attacks on the news media, his leisurely digressions into his 2016 election victory, his professions of affection for strongmen like Kim Jong-un of North Korea, and the thumping classic-rock soundtrack, Mr. Trump could have been at one of his political rallies. Still, the president’s trip to the Midwest on Thursday, which included a stop in Iowa, also cast a light on farmers, whose soybean exports dried up after China struck back over the tariffs. While praising President Xi Jinping as a friend and a “great guy,” he said China was punishing farmers so it could continue its longstanding practice of stealing technology from American companies. "
994,"The federal government reported Thursday that it would meet a court-ordered deadline to reunite the last “eligible” migrant families separated at the Southwest border, but hundreds of children remained in federal custody as a result of a contentious immigration policy that has drawn international condemnation. Officials with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency reunited 1,442 of the last group of children with their families and said they expected to complete all “eligible” reunifications by midnight Thursday, Pacific time. “By the court deadline this evening, we are on track to reunite all eligible parents within ICE custody,” said Chris Meekins, chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services. But in a day that saw government officials and community volunteers scrambling to bring families together, multiple reports of failed reunifications raised questions about whether the deadline had in fact been met. Further confusing the issue was a change in the way the government tallied its progress, with the latest report counting children rather than parents, a reversal from prior reports. “The data is dynamic,” a government official said of the discrepancy in a conference call with reporters. Even if Thursday’s deadline was met, the government’s work to address the effects of the family separation policy was far from over. The parents who were deemed eligible for reunification represent only about a third of all those who were separated from their children after crossing the border, a practice that began last summer and escalated in May. "
995,"Delays in China that led Qualcomm to call off its acquisition of a rival microchip maker had nothing to do with escalating trade tensions with the United States, a spokesman for the Chinese Commerce Ministry said on Thursday. Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors first announced their $44 billion union nearly two years ago. Qualcomm is based in San Diego and NXP in the Netherlands, but both do significant business in China, which is why its antimonopoly authorities had say over whether the deal would go through. But as frictions between the United States and China intensified this year, Beijing’s prolonged antitrust review came to be seen as a form of leverage over the negotiations. The Trump administration imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods this month, and Beijing immediately retaliated with levies of its own. Chinese regulators never formally rejected the deal, which had been approved by eight other jurisdictions, including the United States. But Beijing dragged its review out to more than 20 months. Speaking Thursday at a news conference after Qualcomm said it was expecting to walk away from the deal, Gao Feng, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, denied the link to trade, according to a transcript posted on the ministry’s website. Qualcomm and NXP formally announced the cancellation later on Thursday. “As of what I know, the case is about antimonopoly law enforcement,” Mr. Gao said, referring reporters to the State Administration for Market Regulation, which has official oversight of antitrust matters. The market regulator has not commented on the matter recently. "

Facebook fends off trolls, Greece fights an uphill economic battle and a U.S. judge blocks blueprints for “ghost guns.” Here’s the latest: • Facebook announced that it had identified a coordinated political influence campaign, with dozens of inauthentic accounts and pages that are believed to be engaging in political activity ahead of U.S. midterm elections in November. The company has been working with the F.B.I. to investigate the activity, which some officials suspect is tied to Russia. Like the Russian interference campaign in 2016, the recently detected campaign deals with divisive social issues. Above, Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, testifying before Congress this spring. Also in Washington, President Trump reiterated his threat to shut down the federal government this fall if Congress does not agree to build his border wall, and the bank and tax fraud trial of Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, got off to a quick start. _____ "
999,"TAMPA, Fla. — President Trump brought a message of a booming economy with him to Central Florida on Tuesday evening. He boasted about his administration’s economic accomplishments at an event at a local high school, where a supporter cheerily praised him as “the best president.” And he signed a piece of work force legislation, holding up a scrawled piece of paper for all to see. But the tone changed when Mr. Trump traveled to a “Make America Great Again” rally at a fairground auditorium in Tampa. The president, in a feisty but unfocused mood, stood before a group of supporters, called himself “the most popular person in the history of the Republican Party” — a debunked claim — and took aim at his usual list of piñatas, boogeymen and political targets. “Those people,” Mr. Trump said of his perceived detractors, “how they have gotten us wrong. And yet on Election Day, people were asking, ‘Where did these people come from?’” Mr. Trump, a former campaign firebrand, is happiest out on the trail reiterating the divisive messaging that won him the presidency. So on Tuesday, between promoting healthy job numbers and the low unemployment rate, he spent a significant amount of time riling up the crowd by drawing a firm divide between the people who support him and everyone else. In a freewheeling speech, Mr. Trump defended his hard-line stance on immigration, calling for voter ID laws just before inexplicably bragging about saving “Merry Christmas” as a holiday greeting. And he railed repeatedly at the news media for, among other perceived sins, dinging him for not acting presidential. “I can be more presidential than any president in history except for maybe Abe Lincoln with the big hat,” Mr. Trump said. “I admit it, Abe Lincoln is tough.” "
1000,"Chinese investment in the United States is about to get a bit harder. Legislation expanding the powers of a federal body that reviews foreign investments in the United States for national security threats passed the Senate 87-10 on Wednesday as part of a $717 billion defense policy bill, and it is now headed to President Trump for his signature. The bill, known as the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, broadens the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius (pronounced SIFF-ee-yus). The committee will soon have more power to investigate, and possibly block, foreign deals. “We cannot continue to let bad actors, like China, erode our national security advantage by circumventing our laws,” said Senator John Cornyn, the Texas Republican sponsoring the bill. “This bill will modernize the process and help put an end to the backdoor transfer of dual-use technology that has gone unchecked for too long. Mr. Trump has previously said an expansion of Cfius would be a powerful tool national security and economic tool “that better protects the crown jewels of American technology and intellectual property from transfers and acquisitions that threaten our national security — and future economic prosperity.” Here is what an expanded Cfius will look like: The current committee investigates only cases in which a foreign company’s attempt to acquire or merge with an American company poses a national security risk. The committee, which is made up of members of the State, Defense, Justice, Commerce, Energy and Homeland Security Departments and is led by the Treasury secretary — sends its findings and a recommendation to the president, who has the power to suspend or prohibit the deal. Cfius’s ruling, however, is typically enough to kill even the largest billion-dollar deals. "
1001,"The anguish still rises unmistakably from the pages of the deposition, which is now nearly 40 years old. In it, a witness named David Hall hesitates as he testifies, and a lawyer asks if he needs a short break. Hall declines and continues. By the time he is done, he has provided a devastating account of the final moments in the life of Thurman Munson, the Yankees catcher who died at age 32 when the plane he was flying crashed short of the runway at Akron-Canton Airport in Ohio on Aug. 2, 1979. Hall was in the plane when it slammed into the ground. In the deposition, he describes how in the immediate aftermath of the crash, Munson lay motionless, his head turned sideways and pressed against the instrument panel. Munson’s neck, it turned out, had been broken by the impact of the crash. His body was paralyzed. Still, Hall testified, Munson managed to ask him and Jerry Anderson, the other passenger in the plane, if they were O.K. And then, Hall testified, flames began to lick at the fuselage of the Cessna Citation turbojet, and Munson gasped, “Fire extinguisher.” What followed, Hall said, were the final words uttered by Munson, the hard-nosed All-Star and team captain. “Help me, Dave,” he said. "
1002,"ALEXANDRIA, Va. — To the manager of Alan Couture, a high-end men’s wear boutique in Manhattan, Paul Manafort was one of his top five customers, spending more than $900,000, paid by wire transfer, over five years ending in 2014. The controller for the House of Bijan in Beverly Hills, Calif., sometimes called “the world’s most expensive men’s store,” said he was “a very good customer.” A neighbor of Mr. Manafort’s in suburban Virginia recalled how he showed him a $1.9 million home and Mr. Manafort decided to “go for it,” offering the seller full price. The second day of the trial for Mr. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, on tax and bank fraud charges felt at times more like “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous” than a first, politically charged courtroom test of the inquiry led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. But the prosecutors on Mr. Mueller’s team had a very specific goal in calling witnesses to testify about Mr. Manafort’s spending habits: to present the jury with detailed evidence that he wired millions of dollars from secret overseas bank accounts to buy and renovate homes in places like the Hamptons and suburban Washington, shop at the country’s most exclusive men’s boutiques and snap up one luxury vehicle after another with income he hid from the tax authorities. In offering vivid details about Mr. Manafort’s thirst for the finer things in life, the prosecutors sought to paint him as a man driven by greed, adept at lies and shrewd enough to cover his tracks with false invoices, sham companies and wire transfers from financial institutions in a city in Cyprus that his vendors in the United States had never heard of. They were curbed, to an extent, by Judge T. S. Ellis III of the United States District Court in Alexandria, Va. He repeatedly held the prosecutors at bay, refusing to allow them to describe Mr. Manafort’s new pool house at his home in the Hamptons or to show jurors photographs of Mr. Manafort’s closets of expensive suits at his condominium in Arlington. "
1003,"Former President Barack Obama took a public step back into the electoral arena on Wednesday, issuing a slate of 81 endorsements for Democrats running in the 2018 elections and giving his stamp of approval to more than a dozen veterans of his administration and election campaigns who are seeking office in their own right. Among the most prominent candidates to earn his backing were Richard Cordray, the former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, who is running for governor of Ohio; J.B. Pritzker, the private equity executive and Hyatt Hotels heir who is the party’s nominee for governor in Illinois; and Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia House minority leader who is vying to become the first African-American woman elected governor of a state. But Mr. Obama also extended his political blessing to Democrats running far down the ballot, backing legislative candidates in states such as North Carolina and Texas, as well as Democrats running for relatively low-profile offices, including secretary of agriculture in Iowa, state auditor in Ohio and lieutenant governor in California and Illinois. [Here’s what’s coming up next on the primary calendar.] The former president unveiled his endorsements with little fanfare and no advance notice, posting the list on Twitter with a concise explanatory note that called the candidates “as diverse, patriotic and big-hearted as the America they’re running to represent.” Without rebuking President Trump or the Republican Party directly, Mr. Obama took up the rhetoric of change that Democrats have trumpeted in their campaigns this year. "
1004,"Those watching President Trump’s rally in Tampa on Tuesday couldn’t help but be exposed to a fringe movement that discusses several loosely connected and vaguely defined — and baseless — conspiracy theories. In one shot on Fox News, the president was partially obscured by a sign in the crowd reading “We Are Q.” In another shot during the president’s speech, a sign promoting the debunked Seth Rich conspiracy theory, with the hashtag #Qanon, came into focus in the center of the screen. Some attendees wore T-shirts with a blocky Q. Others held up signs with the letter. They were all self-described “followers of Q,” an anonymous person or group of people who claim to be privy to government secrets. That supposedly classified information has been revealed on the 4chan and 8chan message boards and spread around mainstream internet platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Q has attracted people — the exact number is hard to know — eager to consume his “bread crumbs,” or new details in a sprawling web of conspiracy theories. What is going on? Here is the short version: Q claims to be a government insider exposing an entrenched, international bureaucracy that is secretly plotting all sorts of nefarious schemes against the Trump administration and its supporters. The character uses lingo that implies that he or she has a military or intelligence background. It’s a stew of various, but connecting, conspiracy theories that generally hold Mr. Trump as a conquistador battling a cabal of anti-American saboteurs who have taken over government, industry, media and various other institutions of public life in a plan to … well, the overarching goals of the nefarious actors are not clear. "
1005,"HONG KONG — Google withdrew from China eight years ago to protest the country’s censorship and online hacking. Now, the internet giant is working on a censored search engine for China that will filter websites and search terms that are blacklisted by the Chinese government, according to two people with knowledge of the plans. Google has teams of engineers working on a search app that restricts content banned by Beijing, said the people, who asked for anonymity because they were not permitted to speak publicly about the project. The company has demonstrated the service to Chinese government officials, they added. Yet the existence of the project does not mean that Google’s return to China is imminent, the people cautioned. Google often builds and tests different services that never become publicly available. Google’s reversal in China, which was reported earlier by The Intercept, is the latest example of how American tech companies are trying to tailor their products to enter the huge Chinese market, even if it means tamping down free speech. LinkedIn censors content in China, for example. And Facebook developed software to suppress certain posts from appearing on the social network, with the aim of potentially deploying it in China, though there was no indication it was offered to Chinese authorities. Many of these overtures appear to fall short of winning over Beijing. Last month, Facebook briefly gained approval to open a subsidiary in China’s Zhejiang Province, but that approval was abruptly withdrawn after a matter of hours. Google’s work on a censored search engine for China has already caused an outcry among human rights activists. Many are concerned that the company would block a long list of foreign websites including Facebook, Twitter and The New York Times, as well as Chinese search queries including the 1989 Tiananmen massacre and information about the Chinese leadership. "
1006,"LONDON — Lakshmi N. Mittal, the chairman and chief executive of ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steel maker, is the rare business leader who applauds President Trump’s protectionist approach to trade. For Mr. Mittal, the White House’s tariffs on steel imported into the United States have driven up prices, which, along with strong global demand, have delivered his company’s best results since 2011. On Wednesday, ArcelorMittal said profit rose to $1.9 billion in the second quarter, a 41 percent increase from the same period a year earlier, on sales of $20 billion. The remarks, and the earnings, stand in stark contrast to fears voiced by companies and analysts in the United States and elsewhere over Mr. Trump’s protectionist push. The White House has imposed steel and aluminum tariffs on a wide range of countries, and, while it has pulled back in recent weeks on the threat of even more aggressive levies on some allies, several businesses have cited the uncertainty over trade as hurting business. “The industry has quite changed,” Mr. Mittal said in an interview after ArcelorMittal reported its results. “Trade actions in various countries have really helped in structurally changing the landscape of the steel industry.” Mr. Mittal built ArcelorMittal into the world’s only truly global steel maker through a series of deals in the 1990s and 2000s. But in recent years the company’s profitability has been sapped by a combination of weak global demand and sharply increased supply from China, which now accounts for about half the world’s steel-making capacity. Now, protectionist measures in the United States and elsewhere, combined with strong global demand, are paying off for ArcelorMittal and other steel producers. "
1007,"LONDON — Are you in the market for 1,200 rolls of toilet paper? A broken Dyson vacuum cleaner? A Sony camera in unknown working condition — which doesn’t come with a charger? If so, you’re in luck. The United States Embassy in London is holding an online auction in which you can also find a used Volvo S80, a photocopier, a printer table and 22 plastic chairs, among other items. This is far from the first auction to be held in the embassy in London, but it might be the only one to have garnered so much attention online. In January, the embassy moved from a building listed as having high architectural interest, in the upmarket Grosvenor Square in central London, to a fortified, high-tech glass construction on a redevelopment site near the River Thames. The move attracted the ire of President Trump, who railed at the cost of the new building as a “bad deal” and canceled a visit to London to open it. There are four other active online auctions of surplus properties from American embassies. “All of our embassies around the world regularly hold auctions in order to dispose of surplus property,” an embassy spokeswoman said by phone on Wednesday. None of the items bear the United States insignia or are of historical value, the spokeswoman added. But you can bid on a stained rug, used mattress or an X-ray machine from the United States Embassy in Yereman, Armenia; and an air-conditioning unit from the one in Tirana, Albania. Get a light-green living room set on which diplomatic visitors to the embassy in Kiev, Ukraine, may have made themselves comfortable. Snap up two tangerine arm chairs sold in Ankara, Turkey. Whether it’s in euros, pounds, or Turkish lira, the revenue from the online auctions goes back to the budget of the United States government. “If foreign excess personal property is not disposed of by transfer or return to the United States, it may be sold if in the best interest of the U.S. government,” according to the country’s Foreign Affairs Manual. The toilet roll set, for example, had attracted 32 bidders by Wednesday afternoon, and was going for almost $335. The embassy spokeswoman said that embassy move had created a need for smaller toilet rolls. “The new embassy has a different toilet roll dispenser,” she explained, adding that this auction was an opportunity to discard the toilet rolls from the old embassy building. So hurry — the online auction will be running until Aug. 8. "
1008,"WASHINGTON — President Trump escalated his trade war with China on Wednesday, ordering his administration to consider more than doubling proposed tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent, as talks between Washington and Beijing remain at a standstill. Mr. Trump instructed the United States trade representative to look into increasing tariffs on Chinese imports like fish, petroleum, chemicals, handbags and other goods to 25 percent, a significant step in a dispute that is beginning to take a toll on industries and consumers in both countries. A final decision on the size and scope of the tariffs is not expected before September. The effort to further punish China is being led by hard-line advisers to Mr. Trump, who believe inflicting painful measures on Beijing is the best way to force it back to the negotiating table on trade. But that approach is once again creating fissures within Mr. Trump’s own team, with his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, adamantly opposed to ratcheting up the tariffs and Peter Navarro, a key trade adviser, advocating the higher duties, people with knowledge of the discussions said. Stephen K. Bannon, who left the White House last August, has also been counseling the president to pursue tougher tariffs, according to people familiar with his thinking. The potential for a 25 percent tax is being fueled by deep frustration within the Trump administration over its unsuccessful attempts to press China to change its trade practices, as well as by a sharp decline in the value of China’s currency. Administration officials have also been concerned that China may be manipulating prices of commodities like soybeans to harm American farmers, and hurting American companies through regulatory practices — for example, detaining shipments of agricultural products in customs until they rot. “We have been very clear about the specific changes China should undertake,” Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said in a statement Wednesday. “Regrettably, instead of changing its harmful behavior, China has illegally retaliated against U.S. workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses.” Since formal talks between Beijing and Washington broke down in May, Mr. Trump has doubled down on his threats, saying he is prepared to impose tariffs on all Chinese imports. Beijing has promised to retaliate with its own measures, and both countries have already imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other’s products. "
1009,"Marla Hohner was at home in Dallas when a text message arrived from an unfamiliar number. “Hi Marla,” it read. “This is Nate volunteering w/ Beto For Texas. Beto O’Rourke is running for Senate to represent Texans statewide, not special interest megadonors. And unlike Ted Cruz, Beto doesn’t take any money from PACs. Can we count on your vote?” Ms. Hohner, a senior adviser for a financial firm, was puzzled. She had heard of Mr. O’Rourke, a Democrat running against Mr. Cruz in November. But she had never volunteered for his campaign, given him money or agreed to be contacted by his volunteers. “It felt like a real invasion,” she said. “My first reaction was, who is this? How do they know my name? And how did they get my cellphone number?” Welcome to the age of the political mass-text. Candidates in this year’s midterm elections are still sending mailers, putting ads on TV and knocking on doors to drum up support. But they’ve added a new, hard-to-ignore tool to their arsenal: personalized text messages sent to voters’ phones. In a mobile-first age when TV ads are skipped and email inboxes automatically filter out junk and promotions, it’s not surprising that campaigns are desperate for a tool that can reliably get voters’ attention. What is surprising is how influential the lowly SMS text message, a tool that was invented during the elder President George Bush’s administration, has remained. This year, as social media platforms like Facebook lure political advertisers with the promise of microtargeted ads, old-fashioned texting has had an unlikely resurgence. Both Democratic and Republican campaigns are relying on mass-texting apps that take advantage of a clever legal loophole to send huge numbers of texts per day without running afoul of anti-spam laws. "
1010,"The Trump administration has just completed rules that will allow people to shop for a new kind of health insurance. So-called short-term plans will be offered for relatively long periods — just under a year at a time, with renewals for up to 36 months — and they will be marketed extensively in most states. They will tend to have substantially lower prices than the insurance people can buy in Obamacare markets, and for some people they may look like a better option. But the plans are cheaper for a reason: They tend to cover fewer medical services than comprehensive insurance, and they will charge higher prices to people with pre-existing health problems, if they’ll cover them at all. That means that it’s really important to shop carefully. Such plans frequently contain a lot of fine print and tend to have a lot more holes in coverage than the Obamacare plans that most people who buy their own insurance currently have. Currently, short-term plans are allowed in most states but can be sold for only three months at a time. The new, longer-term short-term plans will become available 60 days from now. "
1011,"WASHINGTON — President Trump called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday to end the special counsel’s inquiry into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, issuing an unambiguous directive on Twitter to shut down an investigation that even now is scrutinizing his tweets for evidence of obstruction. The White House and Mr. Trump’s lawyers moved quickly to minimize the president’s statement, dismissing it as merely a case of venting by a president who has grown increasingly angry with an investigation that he considers illegitimate — and not a direct order to a cabinet secretary to interfere with a continuing federal law enforcement matter. But in saying that Mr. Sessions, the United States’ top law enforcement official, should take specific action to terminate the investigation, the tweet crossed a line that Mr. Trump has never explicitly crossed — until now. It immediately raised more questions about whether Mr. Trump was attempting to obstruct justice, already an issue being examined extensively by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation. The trial of Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, which entered its second day Tuesday, has made the stakes of Mr. Mueller’s investigation increasingly clear. And even as Mr. Trump was calling for the investigation to end, it was revealed that he had pushed his lawyers to make another attempt to reach an agreement to sit for an interview, an objective that the president has long sought because of his belief that he can convince Mr. Mueller of his version of events. But the morning tweet signified a new chapter in the public feud between the president and Mr. Sessions, the product of Mr. Trump’s rage and sense of betrayal at his attorney general for recusing himself from the Russia inquiry. That has made it impossible for the president to control an investigation that he sees as undercutting his legitimacy. “This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further,” Mr. Trump wrote in a morning tweet. “Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!” "
1012,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) It has been two months since officials at the University of Southern California announced that the university’s president, C.L. Max Nikias, would resign. The announcement came after a sustained outcry from faculty, students and alumni over the way the administration dealt with Dr. George Tyndall, a longtime gynecologist accused of inappropriate behavior for decades. The faculty offered a vote of no confidence, and hundreds of top professors publicly called for his resignation. But while the board of trustees announcedon May 25 that Mr. Nikias “agreed to begin an orderly transition” to a new administration, little has changed on campus this summer. Now, more than 650 professors have signed a letter demanding that he leave before students arrive this month. “With no follow-up regarding an interim president or a presidential search process, we find ourselves in a state of turmoil and uncertainty,” the letter addressed to the board of trustees said. “President Nikias cannot be the one who stands up to greet the new students at the convocation. If he is, we face the prospect of student protests and walkouts, parent outrage, and a broad public perception that we have gone back on our commitment to accountability and transparency, as the world outside U.S.C. believes he has already resigned.” Brenda Maceo, the university’s vice president for public relations and marketing, said in an email that Mr. Nikias is on vacation, as is his top deputy, Provost Michael Quick. In their absence, Jim Staten, the chief financial officer of the university, is acting president until Mr. Quick returns, she said. The board of trustees is scheduled to meet next Tuesday, Ms. Maceo said, and will vote then on the formation of a presidential search committee that will work with a recruiter to make recommendations to the board. She added that Rick Caruso, the chairman of the board, “has had a number of constructive conversations with students, faculty, staff and alumni about the future of the university and its next president and will continue to seek broad input.” Still, Ms. Maceo could not say whether Mr. Nikias will step down so that an interim president can take his place during the search. "
1013,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration issued a final rule on Wednesday that clears the way for the sale of many more health insurance policies that do not comply with the Affordable Care Act and do not have to cover prescription drugs, maternity care or people with pre-existing medical conditions. President Trump has said that he believes that the new “short-term, limited-duration insurance” could help millions of people who do not want or need comprehensive health insurance providing the full range of benefits required by the health law. The new plans will provide “much less expensive health care at a much lower price,” Mr. Trump said. The prices may be lower because the benefits will be fewer, and insurers do not have to cover pre-existing conditions or the people who have them. Democrats derided the new policies as “junk insurance” that will lure healthy people away from the broader insurance market, raising premiums for sicker people and putting purchasers at risk. “After an illness or an injury, many Americans who enroll in these G.O.P. junk health coverage plans will end up being hit by crushing medical bills, finding that they have been paying for coverage that doesn’t cover much at all,” said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader. Under the current rule, issued in late 2016 by the Obama administration, short-term insurance cannot last for more than three months, as it was meant to be a stopgap. Under the new rule, the limit would be 364 days, and insurers would be allowed, but not required, to extend policies. The maximum duration, including any extensions, would be 36 months. "

The company removed 32 pages and fake accounts focused on divisive social issues — from a sequel to last year’s “Unite the Right” white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., to a campaign to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement. (NBC reports that Facebook didn’t reveal the most divisive rhetoric it removed.) Facebook says it resembles past work by the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency, but can’t yet prove a connection to Russia. In 2016, Facebook played down the impact of such activity — now it’s trying to get out ahead. More meddling: Vice President Mike Pence blamed Russia for 2016 election interference, and promised tougher security. The iPhone maker’s profits increased to $11.52 billion in its most recent quarter, it reported yesterday — up nearly a third year on year. But the number of iPhones sold grew less than 1 percent. Where was the cash from? Pricier devices: Customers paid nearly 20 percent more on average (thank the $1,000 iPhone X). Services, too: Revenue from apps, data storage, music and the like grew 31 percent. The earnings exceeded Wall Street estimates, and shares rose nearly 4 percent after-hours. That will ease concerns about Apple’s growth slowing, as it edges toward becoming the first $1 trillion public company. "
1015,"LONDON — Tommy Robinson, the jailed British far-right activist backed by the former Trump aide Stephen K. Bannon but reviled by others who call him a violent purveyor of hate, was ordered to be freed on bail Wednesday, after challenging his conviction for contempt of court. Mr. Robinson was arrested in May after he live-streamed a video from outside a criminal trial in Leeds, England, which had a news media blackout, revealing the defendants’ identities. He was sentenced to 13 months in prison for contempt of court, provoking an international outcry in far-right circles. On Wednesday, the Court of Appeal ordered his release, pending a new hearing in his case. The court questioned the speed with which he had been tried and convicted, noting that it took five hours from the time of his arrest to a conviction. Who is Tommy Robinson? Mr. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon, is the founder of the English Defense League, an anti-Islam and anti-immigration movement known for violent street protests. Born and raised in Luton, north of London, he worked at the town’s international airport but lost that job after assaulting an off-duty police officer. He was also arrested after being accused of inciting soccer violence, as a supporter of the Luton soccer club. “Wherever he has gone in his career he organized demonstrations that have resulted in extreme violence,” said Joe Mulhall, a senior researcher at Hope Not Hate, an organization in London that researches hate groups. "
1016,"With fewer than 100 days to go until the midterms, the evidence continues to pile up that America’s electoral system remains a hot target for hackers, most notably agents of the Russian government. Last Thursday, Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat up for re-election this year, confirmed that she was one of two or possibly three congressional candidates whose computer networks had been unsuccessfully targeted by the Russians last year. The phishing attack, which occurred last August, was thwarted by Microsoft, which subsequently alerted her to the attempt. “While this attack was not successful, it is outrageous that they think they can get away with this,” said Ms. McCaskill in a statement. Three days later, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, acknowledged that, in an unrelated episode, her office also had been a target of multiple spear-phishing attacks, the origins of which have yet to be officially determined. The effort bears similarities to Russia’s handiwork, but the matter is still under investigation. Ms. Shaheen said she had been told that this problem “is widespread, with political parties across the country, as well as with members of the Senate.” (Ms. Shaheen, a staunch critic of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, also received a phone call in November from someone impersonating a Latvian official and hoping to gain inside information on American sanctions against Russia. The F.B.I. is looking into that episode as well.) Attempts to disrupt America’s government and electoral system are widespread and multifaceted. This week, in fact, Facebook announced that it had identified and removed dozens of pages and accounts linked to a coordinated effort aimed at influencing the November elections. But it’s no mystery why Russia and other bad actors would assume they could get away with such incursions. Despite repeated warnings from United States intelligence agencies regarding the nation’s vulnerabilities, there remains no focused, coordinated plan by the White House for dealing with this crucial security issue. Nor does President Trump seem comfortable criticizing, much less holding accountable, the baddest of bad actors identified by American intelligence agencies — Mr. Putin. Quite the opposite: When it comes to cyberattacks on American democracy, the message coming from this president reeks of confusion, equivocation and weakness. After the humiliating Trump-Putin cuddlefest in Helsinki, Finland, one might have expected Mr. Trump to clarify America’s displeasure regarding Moscow’s meddling. Instead, the president continues to dither and blow smoke. One minute he’s insisting that he supports the findings of American intelligence, the next he’s tweeting that the notion of Russian meddling is “all a big hoax.” "
1017,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration imposed sanctions on Wednesday against two top Turkish government officials over the detention of an American pastor being held on espionage charges, threatening to plunge already-fraught relations with a vital NATO ally into crisis. The move was an extraordinary use of financial sanctions against an allied government. It is sure to inflame tensions that were already simmering over a litany of disagreements, including Washington’s refusal to extradite a cleric suspected of leading a failed 2016 coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and his country’s growing use of what many Western analysts have described as hostage diplomacy. “The relationship is now officially in crisis, and the only way out is for Erdogan to do what he hates the most: back down,” said Julianne Smith, the deputy national security adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The sanctions target Abdulhamit Gul, Turkey’s justice minister, and Suleyman Soylu, the interior minister. They were issued just days after President Trump warned the Turkish government to immediately release the pastor, Andrew Brunson — a demand he made directly last week in a telephone call with Mr. Erdogan. The sanctions mark a rare public break between Mr. Trump and Mr. Erdogan, two combative leaders and allies in the ongoing military campaign against the Islamic State. A senior Trump administration official said the American president’s ire resulted in part because he thought he had struck a deal with Mr. Erdogan to free Mr. Brunson if Israeli authorities released a Turkish woman being held on charges of funding Hamas.

1018,"Recently, two Opinion columnists imagined the outcome of the next presidential election and the circumstances which would lead us there. First, Bret Stephens presented a scenario in which President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence easily best their opponents, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and her running mate, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, because the Democrats swing even further left and turn off their base. In response, David Leonhardt painted a picture that one reader described as “liberal erotica”: an unpopular incumbent who, without the help of a flawed rival and meddling Russians, loses “bigly” to Ms. Warren and former Attorney General Eric Holder and their campaign against a greedy, corrupt administration. In thousands of comments, our readers praised and lamented each version and offered their own takes on what newspaper headlines might report on Nov. 4, 2020. Selections from those comments are below; they’ve been edited for length and clarity. The Democrats, having learned their lesson from the 2016 debacle, finally got their act together. They stopped blaming Russia, Susan Sarandon, Jill Stein, Julian Assange and the Easter bunny and conducted an extensive self autopsy. Under fresh new leadership, the Democratic National Committee ran a fair and transparent primary with many debates scheduled at prime time. They banned superdelegates and agreed not to accept “super PAC” money. They also banned the terms “Bernie Bro” and “I’m With Her.” Bernie Sanders then easily won the primary race. “I decided to play it safe and only run on what the American people support,” said Sanders. “Practical, incremental, moderate things, like Medicare for All, free college tuition, legalizing marijuana, and breaking up the big banks.” Bernie then chose Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to be his running mate, prompting Fox News to immediately open a satellite office in Venezuela. — G.Janeiro, Global Citizen What was long anticipated was confirmed by yesterday’s election: President Trump has been elected for a third term winning a commanding 97 percent of the popular vote. In an exclusive interview with White House press secretary Sean Hannity, Mr. Trump’s running mate, Jared Kushner, acknowledged Mr. Trump’s thanks to the American people.
— Jabarry, Maryland As a moderate Republican, I abhor Trump. I was hoping for Jeb Bush and John Kasich. Bret’s make-believe story is too upsetting to imagine. I voted but for a third party. If we had been smart we would have voted for Hillary Clinton, the lesser of two evils.
— Nurse Jacki, Conn. Bret, what goes up must come down. This economy has been in expansion mode since 2010, and in bubble mode since 2017. Don’t count on it continuing between now and November 2020. Furthermore, don’t be surprised if health issues rear their head between now and then. And if Warren is indeed the candidate in November 2020, she is winning this thing.   "

An extraordinary request in Washington, trouble with dams in Southeast Asia and the decade that almost stopped climate change. Here’s what you need to know: • “Stop this rigged witch hunt right now.” President Trump called on his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to end the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible ties to Trump associates. Some lawyers immediately questioned whether the extraordinary request, made on Twitter, was an attempt to obstruct justice. Mr. Trump’s lawyers suggested that he was giving his opinion, not an order.

1020,"SAN FRANCISCO — When Facebook revealed on Tuesday that it had identified a political influence campaign ahead of the November midterm elections, the company’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, was front-and-center in speaking on the issue. But Mr. Stamos will exit the social network this month, just as Facebook steps up its efforts to combat misinformation and foreign interference. In an interview, Mr. Stamos, 39, said he planned to join Stanford University in September as an adjunct professor and will also become part of a faculty working group called Information Warfare where he will examine the role of security and technology in society. The timing is tricky as Facebook grapples with potential threats including election meddling and hackers. The New York Times reported in March that Mr. Stamos planned to leave Facebook in August and that his day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others last December, but the Silicon Valley company does not plan to appoint a successor for chief security officer. In an internal Facebook post from January written by Mr. Stamos, which was obtained by The Times, he said the company’s security team was being reorganized and would no longer operate as a stand-alone entity. Instead, he wrote, Facebook’s security workers would be more closely aligned with the product and engineering teams and focus either on protecting the company’s corporate infrastructure or its users. “The safety and security challenges we face today are dispersed across many surfaces, and addressing them requires the focus of many teams across the company,” Mr. Stamos wrote in the post. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, said in a statement on Wednesday that Facebook would continue to collaborate with Mr. Stamos in his new job at Stanford. "

The administration is considering raising tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese products to 25 percent — not the 10 percent previously indicated — in a bid to bring Beijing back to the bargaining table. _____ "
1022,"WASHINGTON — President Trump pushed his lawyers in recent days to try once again to reach an agreement with the special counsel’s office about his sitting for an interview, flouting their advice that he should not answer investigators’ questions, three people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday. Mr. Trump has told advisers he is eager to meet with investigators to clear himself of wrongdoing, the people said. In effect, he believes he can convince the investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, of his belief that their own inquiry is a “witch hunt.” Mr. Mueller, whose team has negotiated the parameters of an interview with Mr. Trump’s lawyers for eight months, sent his latest proposal in a letter Tuesday night, the three people said. Investigators stood firm on the scope of and topics for their questions for Mr. Trump: possible coordination between his associates and Russia’s election interference and whether he tried to obstruct the investigation. They did shift slightly on format, agreeing to accept some written answers, including matters in which they want to preserve the ability to have Mr. Trump answer follow-ups in person. In doing so, they firmed up a previously expressed willingness to allow certain answers in writing. The president’s lawyers are unwilling to concede to follow-ups in person, citing concerns that Mr. Trump will increase his legal exposure, the people said. They have been prepared to tell Mr. Mueller’s office there will be no interview, risking a court fight over a subpoena that could drag into November’s midterm elections, but Mr. Trump pushed them to continue negotiating. The lawyers are likely to counter Mr. Mueller’s proposal in the coming days, according to the three people. “We’re in the process of responding to their proposal,” the president’s lead lawyer for the investigation, Rudolph W. Giuliani, told reporters after an event in Portsmouth, N.H., on Wednesday. The special counsel’s office declined to comment. "

1025,"WASHINGTON — The mandate given to Robert S. Mueller III and his team was broad: to investigate not just Russian election interference but also any related crimes they might unearth. So when this group of seasoned prosecutors began rooting around Washington, they pounced on a ripe target — lobbyists taking millions of dollars from foreign governments. At the trial of Paul Manafort, an unflattering picture has emerged of lawyers, lobbyists and consultants from both political parties winning big paydays for work on behalf of a Kremlin-aligned former Ukrainian strongman. Some spent the money on cars and homes, prosecutors said, and a jacket made of ostrich for Mr. Manafort. The vigor with which Mr. Mueller has investigated the flows of foreign money from Ukraine, Turkey and other countries into Washington could be as much a part of his legacy as special counsel as whatever he discovers about possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign or presidential obstruction of justice. The Manafort case is part of a broader inquiry into the lucrative work done on behalf of the former president of Ukraine, Viktor F. Yanukovych, and Mr. Mueller has handed some elements of the investigation to prosecutors in Manhattan. Beyond the special counsel’s office, the Justice Department has also recently been pursuing foreign influence cases with greater urgency. All of this has prompted lobbyists to hunt for advice about how to comply with laws governing that sphere, long viewed as toothless. “The phone rings much more often with this question than it did two years ago,” said Tom Spulak, a partner at the King & Spalding law firm who advises on lobbying compliance. Over the past year, Mr. Mueller and the Justice Department have pursued numerous cases both under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, and related to foreign influence operations more broadly. FARA prosecutions were once almost unheard-of, according to a Justice Department inspector general report: For nearly a half-century, from 1966 until 2015, the department pursued only seven. "
1026,"Two Air Force cargo planes left South Korea for Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii on Wednesday carrying 55 flag-draped crates that are thought to contain the remains of American troops lost during the Korean War. The bones, which were turned over by the North Korean government after a meeting in June between Mr. Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, are bound for a forensic laboratory run by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency in Honolulu, for testing that may finally offer answers to families that have been waiting for 65 years or more. “I was a kid who would run to the phone and the mailbox every day, hoping there was some news about my dad — it never came,” said John Zimmerlee, 69, whose father was a navigator in a B-26 bomber that was shot down over Korea in 1952. But if past efforts to identify remains returned by the secretive dictatorship are any indication, experts say, it will be no simple task to put names to any of the latest batch, and the job may never be entirely completed. [How the Defense Department identifies the remains of American service members] To start with, it is unlikely that the 55 crates — the most in a single release from North Korea since just after the fighting ended — contain the remains of just 55 men. Bones from several bodies have often been jumbled together: The total of 208 coffins delivered in the 1990s turned out to include remains from at least 400 people. “I was there when they opened one of the crates that the North Koreans said held one soldier and his identification card,” said Paul Cole, a former researcher for the RAND Corporation who wrote a series of government reports on the locations of Korean War dead. “It turned out to be a partial skull, five femurs and a cheap wallet calendar.” "
1027,"They covered their tracks, using software to camouflage their internet traffic. They created Facebook pages for anti-Trump culture warriors, Hispanic activists and fans of alternative medicine. And they organized protests in coordination with real-world political groups. The people behind an influence campaign ahead of this year’s elections, which Facebook disclosed on Tuesday, copied enough of the tactics used by Russians in the 2016 races to raise suspicion that Russia was at it again. But the new efforts also revealed signs of a maturing adversary, adapting and evolving to better disguise itself, while also better imitating real activists. The coordinated activity — a collection of memes, photos and posts on issues like feminist empowerment, indigenous rights and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency — show the enormity of the challenge ahead of Facebook, as it tries to weed out impersonators. As the forces behind the accounts become harder to detect, the company is left to separate the ordinary rants and raves of legitimate users from coordinated, possibly state-backed attempts to sway public opinion. “This is not a one-time event limited to the 2016 election,” said Michael Posner, the director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University’s Stern School of Business, which recently published a report about Russian influence campaigns. “It’s a daily drumbeat. These are entities trying to disrupt our democratic process by pushing various forms of disinformation into the system.” Facebook said it had shut down 32 accounts that were collectively followed by 290,000 users. Many of the accounts had few followers, and the overall scope of the operation was smaller than the 2016 Russian campaign. The announcement from the company reinforced concerns in Washington that the federal government and social media companies would not be able to keep foreign actors out of this year’s election. Facebook said it found enough evidence to shut down the accounts, pull the pages and remove the events they organized. But it did not immediately say who was behind the campaign, or where it was based, even as some lawmakers immediately pointed the finger at Russia. "
1028,"The baby wearing a “CNN Sucks!” pin pretty much summed it up. In the back of a fairground auditorium in Tampa, Fla., on Tuesday night, as President Trump presided over a rally dedicated to denigrating his enemies, the journalists dispatched to cover the proceedings attracted their own raucous crowd. “Stop lying!” shouted a man in an American flag T-shirt, one of dozens of Trump supporters who hurled invective at the assembled press corps. Facing the reporters’ work space — and away from the stage where Mr. Trump was set to speak — they flashed middle fingers and chanted “CNN Sucks!” as Jim Acosta, a CNN White House correspondent, attempted to speak on-air. Menacing the media was a theme of Mr. Trump’s campaign rallies in 2016. News networks hired security guards for some correspondents — a practice that, in Mr. Acosta’s case, has continued — and reporters found themselves taunted and disparaged by attendees repeating Mr. Trump’s refrain of “fake news.” In Tampa, though, several journalists described an atmosphere of hostility that felt particularly hard-edge. And far from condemning these attacks on the press, the president and his team have endorsed them. That night, Mr. Trump tweeted out a video of his supporters jeering Mr. Acosta, along with an approving comment from his son Eric: “#truth.” When the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, was invited at Wednesday’s press briefing to condemn the menacing behavior, she declined. "
1029,"WASHINGTON — Just when it seemed like Tuesday’s “Make America Great Again” rally in Florida would end with the typical punch list — Democrats, journalists, immigrants — President Trump added new spice to his usual extemporaneous potpourri by asserting that supermarket shoppers need to show valid identification in the checkout aisle. “You know,” Mr. Trump knowingly told the approving crowd, “if you go out and you want to buy groceries, you need a picture on a card. You need ID.” It is not often that Mr. Trump, a mold-breaking billionaire, is seen as behaving presidentially, which he thinks would be too boring, anyway. But with this particular offhand and baldly inaccurate comment, the president landed himself in the company of other presidents and presidential hopefuls who have fumbled while trying to showcase their everyman appeal. The obvious question immediately surfaced: Has Mr. Trump ever been in the checkout line at a grocery store? Several of the president’s friends — one of them a billionaire owner of a chain of grocery stores — said they cannot recall Mr. Trump ever doing his own grocery shopping. John A. Catsimatidis, the owner of Gristedes Foods, a chain of small grocery stores in Manhattan and Brooklyn, said in an interview that he has known the president for 40 years, but cannot recall a time when Mr. Trump entered one of his stores. “I wouldn’t know,” Mr. Catsimatidis said. “I don’t have any pictures with him in Gristedes.” Thomas J. Barrack Jr., another billionaire friend of the president’s, was blunt when asked if Mr. Trump ever did his own grocery shopping. "
1030,"It is simply not healthy for the country to have a president stuck perpetually in attack mode, fighting enemies real and imagined, pushing a toxic agenda that mixes the exaltation of grievance and the grinding of axes. The president’s recent rallies have come to resemble orgies for Donald Trump’s ego, spaces in which he can receive endless, unmeasured adulation and in which the crowds can gather for a revival of an anger that registers as near-religious. They can experience a communal affirmation that they are not alone in their intolerance, outrage and regression. At these moments, the preacher and the pious share a spiritual moment of darkness. Such was the case again this week at a Trump rally in Florida, at which his supporters aggressively heckled and harassed the free press that Trump incessantly brands with the false descriptor of “fake news.” In fact, there is no such thing as fake news. If something isn’t true, it isn’t news. Opinions, like mine here, are also not news, even if printed in a newspaper or broadcast by a news station. There may be news in such opinions, but the vehicle is by definition subjective and a reflection of the writer’s or speaker’s worldview. This “fake news” nonsense isn’t really about the dissemination of false information. If it were, the administration could demand a correction and would receive one from any reputable news outlet. No, Trump has made a perversion of the word “fake,” particularly among his most ardent supporters, so that it has come to mean news stories he doesn’t like, commentary that is unflattering to him and inadequate coverage of what he views as positive news about him and his administration. "
1031,"No one is above the law — or jury duty for that matter. The denizens of City Hall seldom wander three blocks north to the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building, but the courthouse’s dimly lit halls were buzzing with the city’s peculiar brand of liberal politics on Wednesday, as the mayor reported for jury duty and a city councilman went on trial on charges he was disorderly during an immigrants rights protest. Inside Jury Room 5 on the fourth floor, Jumaane Williams, a Democrat from Flatbush who is also running for lieutenant governor, took his place at the defendant’s table in a packed courtroom to confront charges he blocked an ambulance at a protest against President Trump’s immigration policies. Mr. Williams rejected the standard no-jail plea bargain offered in similar cases and instead decided to challenge his arrest and use the trial as a political platform to highlight what he has described as the country’s unfair enforcement of immigration laws. “I’m looking forward to being able to have my day in court,” he said. Around the same time, on the 15th floor, Mayor Bill de Blasio chatted with fellow jurors in the jury assembly room. With him were about 150 people, several of whom took the opportunity to share their gripes about the city. A few passers-by stopped in to say hello. Like every other potential juror, the mayor responded to questions about his background and his availability to serve. “I think it’s important to serve. It’s really one of the best examples of democracy,” Mr. de Blasio said to reporters. “I think it’s also important for people to see that everyone has to serve. No matter what your title, or what your role is in society.” Back on the fourth floor, Mr. Williams said it was his duty as an elected official “to make sure that everyone is being taken care of, and that there’s justice, there’s equitable policies and that there’s protections.” "
1032,"President Trump will nominate Kelvin Droegemeier, a well-regarded meteorologist who studies severe storms, to be director of the federal Office of Science and Technology Policy. The director acts as the president’s chief adviser on science. The post has been vacant since Mr. Trump’s inauguration, by far the longest the office has been without a director since the position was created in 1976. “I am deeply honored to have been selected by President Trump to serve the nation as director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and I look forward to the Senate confirmation process,” Dr. Droegemeier, 59, said in a statement. Through a spokeswoman, he referred inquiries to the White House science office. If he is confirmed by the Senate, Dr. Droegemeier will join an administration roundly criticized by scientists as dismissive of their work. [New England Journal of Medicine Condemns Trump Approach to Coronavirus and Science] Mr. Trump entered into negotiations with North Korea over its nuclear armaments without counsel from a senior nuclear physicist, for example. He withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement over the objections of most climate scientists. "
1033,"WASHINGTON — When the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE was hit with crippling United States sanctions in April, it chose a very American solution: It loaded up on Washington lobbyists. For three months, the company, based in Shenzen, engaged in a furious — and ultimately successful — campaign to win a reprieve from penalties that threatened to put it out of business and derail diplomatic relations between the United States and China. It hired former lawmakers, legislative aides and a Trump campaign official to try to sway lawmakers with the kind of behind-the-scenes lobbying that President Trump has long derided as a problem of the “swamp.” Top lawmakers met with ZTE lobbyists. High-profile senators mingled at a party given by Hogan Lovells, the primary law firm working on ZTE’s behalf. And the law firm’s political action committee made donations to legislators who had the power to influence ZTE’s fate. Some of the lobbyists involved privately boasted that their efforts scuttled an attempt by Congress to keep ZTE’s sanctions in place. All told, ZTE USA, the company’s American subsidiary, spent nearly $1.4 million over three months trying to influence lawmakers and administration officials. In 2017, the company spent a total of $510,000 on lobbying, according to congressional lobbying filings. On Wednesday, those efforts paid off when the Senate passed a bill containing a much weaker punishment than lawmakers had originally intended — one that will allow ZTE to escape tough penalties related to its violation of American sanctions on Iran and North Korea. "
1034,"STUTTGART, Germany — Hundreds of American troops in Africa would be reassigned and the number of Special Operations missions on the continent would be wound down under plans submitted by a top military commander, a response to the Trump administration’s strategy to increasingly focus on threats from China and Russia. Defense Department officials said they expected most of the troop cuts and scaled-back missions to come from Central and West Africa, where Special Operations missions have focused on training African militaries to combat the growing threat from extremist Islamist militant groups. The plan by Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, the leader of United States Africa Command, follows an ambush in Niger last fall that killed four American soldiers and an attack in southwestern Somalia that killed another in June. In an interview with The New York Times, General Waldhauser said his plan would help streamline the military’s ability to combat threats around the world — but not retreat from Africa. “We’re not walking away,” General Waldhauser said at his Germany headquarters last week, adding that the United States would still “reserve the right to unilaterally return” to protect American interests. Africa has increasingly become an emerging battlefield for the United States in the fight against Islamist militant groups, including the Islamic State, Boko Haram and others across the continent that have sworn loyalty to Al Qaeda.

"
1036,"NEWARK — New Jersey officials announced on Wednesday that they were pursuing several lawsuits targeting former industrial sites around the state where communities are still grappling with the persisting effects of pollution that has seeped into soil, groundwater and nearby waterways. Officials described the lawsuits, which are centered on a half-dozen sites scattered around New Jersey, as a reflection of a push by the administration of Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, for stricter enforcement of the state’s environmental regulations. The move also signals New Jersey positioning itself as a counterbalance to federal environmental officials under the Trump administration who have taken a more lenient approach toward polluters. “They show that today is a new day for environmental enforcement in New Jersey,” Gurbir S. Grewal, the state’s attorney general, said of the lawsuits at a news conference at one of the sites, which had housed a cigarette lighter factory that had closed more than 30 years ago in the Ironbound neighborhood of Newark. “They involve different polluters, and they involve different pollutants,” Mr. Grewal added, referring to the various allegations raised in the lawsuits. “They involve damage to different natural resources. But what they all have in common is that environmental pollution affects all of New Jersey, North and South, rural and urban, rich and poor.” Environmental advocates said that New Jersey, long known for its industrial history, has adopted some of the strongest laws to combat pollution, but they said they welcomed the lawsuits on Wednesday because they signaled a changing tide after years of the state, in their view, growing too lax in enforcing those laws. “Regulations matter, and so do the enforcement of those laws,” said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. “I think the biggest thing is that polluters out there can violate the law because you’ll either not get caught, or if you do get caught, you’ll get off the hook.” "
1037,"ALBANY — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is the de facto leader of the New York State Democratic Party. His formal nomination for a third term came with splashy endorsements from party leaders like Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. For months, he has rallied and railed against Republicans in Congress, calling them traitors and derelict in their duties. And yet, come November, Mr. Cuomo will likely be sitting on the same ballot line as a whole slate of the same Republicans he says need to be voted out of office. The ballot line belongs to the Independence Party of New York, which is run by Frank M. MacKay, a radio and television host who in December endorsed Mr. Cuomo’s campaign for governor, as he has twice before — calling Mr. Cuomo “one of the most accomplished and effective elected officials in the country.” If Mr. Cuomo remains on the Independence Party line, and there is every indication he will, the governor will be collecting votes right alongside a number of Republicans whom he has repeatedly excoriated — and may even help them by his presence on the ticket. They include Representative Chris Collins, the firebrand conservative from the Buffalo area, one of Donald Trump’s earliest and most ardent supporters, who has called the governor “a bully, a blackmailer and an extortionist.” Mr. Cuomo, in turn, has accused Mr. Collins of “putting millions of people at profound risk” by not backing gun control measures. Mr. Collins will be on the Independence line, his spokesman confirmed last week. So will Representative John Faso, whom Mr. Cuomo accused of violating his oath of office by backing a federal reduction in state and local tax deductibility. (Mr. Faso ended up voting against the reduction in deductiblity.) "
1038,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Tells Sessions to ‘Stop This Rigged Witch Hunt Right Now’” (nytimes.com, Aug. 1): President Trump has given us another rant about the “witch hunt,” trying to make the Mueller investigation and its offshoots disappear. And no wonder! Not only is Michael Cohen probably starting to spill his beans, but Paul Manafort is on trial, and if he is convicted will have additional incentives to trade what he knows for a lighter sentence. The best exemplars of our federal government, in the persons of Rod Rosenstein and Robert Mueller, continue to issue indictments. In his anger and frustration, all Mr. Trump can do is tweet his melodic equivalents of Henry II’s plea referring to Thomas Becket (quoted by James Comey at a Senate hearing), “Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?”   Or, to offer another quote that is more and more applicable every day: President Harry Truman’s admonition that “if you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.” I’d be pleased to show Mr. Trump the door. Robert J. Bloch
Pikesville, Md. To the Editor: The arrogant corruption is awe-inspiring. Having recused himself, Attorney General Jeff Sessions can’t “stop” the investigation; he has no legal power to do so. President Trump’s tweet refers to Robert Mueller’s “17 Angry Democrats.” I can’t understand what would be in it for Mr. Mueller, either professionally or otherwise, to staff an investigation with other than the most qualified attorneys available, which by all accounts — save Mr. Trump’s and his lackeys’ — Mr. Mueller has done. Finally, nor can I understand why these repeated demands to shut down Mr. Mueller’s investigation into collusion and obstruction of justice do not themselves constitute obstruction, in spirit if not by statute. Hurry, November! Robert Yarbrough

1040,"In the eight years of the Obama presidency, there were three cycles of policymaking. First came the attempt to pass an ambitious liberal agenda through a Democratic-controlled Congress, which ended with the Republican House takeover in 2010. Then came the attempt to strike bargains, grand and otherwise, with John Boehner and congressional Republicans, which petered out early in Barack Obama’s second term. And finally came the imperial phase, in which activists appealed to the president to claim powers that he had previously abjured, and override or sidestep congressional gridlock on immigration, climate policy and health care through the power of the presidential pen. Under Donald Trump the imperial phase might arrive much sooner. The possibility for further ambitious conservative legislation seems to have died away already; it's hard to imagine Trump successfully making deals with Democrats if his party loses the House in November, and so two years may stretch ahead of us in which literally nothing passes Congress except the necessary budget deals. In the last few weeks we’ve had a preview of how pro-Trump voices will fill that vacuum — with appeals that mirror the appeals of liberal activists in the late Obama years. Dear Mr. President, don’t you realize that you have the power to do [thing that most people assume the president doesn’t have the power to do]? Dear Mr. President, fortune favors the bold. Dear Mr. President, just act. For instance, two weeks ago Michael Anton, erstwhile national security staffer and “Flight 93 Election” essayist, took to The Washington Post with the claim that birthright citizenship isn’t required by the 14th Amendment — and that therefore the president himself, through his constitutional powers, can end jus soli via executive fiat. Meanwhile, cheered on by supply-siders, Trump is considering using a power that previous Republican administrations felt the president did not possess to cut investment taxes sharply by indexing capital gains calculation to inflation. I wrote a lot, sometimes shrilly, about liberal Caesarism in the late Obama years, and the ideas being urged on Trump would represent the right-wing version of that tendency. For observers in the market for authoritarian scenarios, they also point to the surest path to a real constitutional crisis in our staggering republic: an aggressive president who first claims new powers to fill the void where Congress used to work, and then defies the other branches, the courts especially, when they attempt to check his ambitions.

Here’s what you need to know: • The social media giant announced on Tuesday that it had removed 32 pages and fake accounts that were part of a potential effort to influence this fall’s midterm elections. The company did not definitively link the campaign to Russia but said some of its tools and techniques were similar to those used by the Kremlin-linked group accused of interfering in the 2016 election. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said he would make Facebook’s disclosure a central part of a previously scheduled hearing today, when lawmakers plan to press outside experts about foreign influence on social media networks. • Last week, Facebook announced it would spend more on moderation and security, sending tech stocks down sharply. But don’t let that fool you, our tech columnist writes: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft are still on their way to dominating the future. • A federal judge on Tuesday granted a temporary nationwide injunction preventing a man from sharing blueprints for making plastic guns on 3-D printers. "
1042,"Have conservatives hijacked the First Amendment? Critics are increasingly making this claim, maintaining that under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., the First Amendment, once an important safeguard for progressive speech, has become a boon to corporations, conservatives and the powerful. But in most instances, the First Amendment doesn’t favor speech of the right or the left; it simply takes the government out of the business of controlling speakers by virtue of what they say. It often empowers the powerless. And most important, it helps check official abuse. To be sure, conservatives and corporations are invoking the First Amendment, and sometimes winning. In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the Roberts court deployed the First Amendment to guarantee that corporations can engage in unlimited campaign spending. A recent study found that the Roberts court has more often protected conservative than liberal speakers. Justice Elena Kagan herself, dissenting in Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, accused her conservative colleagues of “weaponizing the First Amendment” when they ruled that public sector unions cannot charge nonmembers “agency fees” because it amounts to compelled speech. But these developments should not lead liberals or progressives to lose faith in the First Amendment. For starters, the amendment’s core requirement is that the government must remain neutral regarding the content and viewpoint of speech. As a result, a decision protecting conservative speech will equally support liberal speech. When the Roberts court ruled that the First Amendment prohibited holding the Westboro Baptist Church liable for displaying anti-gay signs outside a military funeral, its rationale would equally protect Revolutionary Communist Party demonstrators holding anti-Christian signs outside the Westboro Baptist Church.

WASHINGTON — The acting chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, Andrew Wheeler, has come under scrutiny for his years spent as a powerful energy lobbyist. He has represented an electric utility, a uranium producer, and, most significantly, a coal magnate who paid Mr. Wheeler’s former lobbying firm more than $2.7 million over eight years. Mr. Wheeler is now in a position to act upon issues he once raised on behalf of his clients. And he is expected to be grilled on his relationships in the Senate on Wednesday, when he makes a regular appearance before the Committee on Environment and Public Works. It will be his first testimony in Congress since assuming leadership of the agency in July, when Scott Pruitt resigned as E.P.A. administrator. In an interview, Mr. Wheeler provided fresh details about his lobbying activities, including specifics not included in his government-required disclosure forms, which have been criticized for their lack of detail. Mr. Wheeler also said that, well before Mr. Pruitt’s ethics scandals hit the E.P.A., he had begun stepping away from lobbying activities related to the E.P.A., on the chance he might serve at the agency. His recent activity as a coal lobbyist, he said, was pushing to kill a rule before the Interior Department that would have restricted coal companies from dumping waste into streams. He also advocated for the Miners Protection Act, he said, a bill that would have used funds earmarked to clean up abandoned mines to bolster mine workers’ health care and pension plans. Mr. Wheeler acknowledged working with Robert Murray, the head of Murray Energy, a coal company, to fight former President Obama’s signature climate change regulation, the Clean Power Plan. But he distanced himself from a series of memos that Mr. Murray earlier had presented to top Trump administration officials — including Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Mr. Pruitt — involving direct E.P.A. issues like eliminating a major regulation on smog and reversing a scientific finding that global warming harms human health. "
1044,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve raised its already high marks for the state of the economy on Wednesday, refusing to bow to President Trump’s recent push for the central bank to pause its march toward higher interest rates. Federal Open Market Committee officials voted unanimously at the end of their two-day meeting to keep interest rates unchanged, at a range of 1.75 to 2 percent. But the statement they issued keeps the Fed on track to raise rates next month and again in December, after two rate increases in the first half of the year. Its revised assessments of economic growth and the inflation rate could signal that those coming increases are even more likely than investors previously thought. The statement declared that the job market continues to strengthen and that “economic activity has been rising at a strong rate.” That is a change from the June statement, when the Fed said economic growth was “solid.” Officials also improved their assessment of consumer spending, saying that it has “grown strongly.” The Fed statement did not convey any concern that Mr. Trump’s trade policies could hamper growth, nor did it suggest worry about the sluggish pace of wage increases for most workers. The Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, fielded a barrage of questions from members of Congress on those topics in testimony last month. In their statement on Wednesday, Fed officials said the overall inflation rate and the rate that excludes volatile food and energy prices both “remain near 2 percent,” which is the Fed’s target level. In June, officials said those rates “have moved close to 2 percent.” In keeping with previous statements, officials continued to signal they will raise rates again soon, saying they expect “that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.” "
1045,"You may have heard that the tech giants are on their heels. Over the last two years, lawmakers and the public around the globe have been awakened to fears about the expanding powers of the largest technology companies, particularly the ones I’ve called the Frightful Five: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, the most valuable companies on the American markets. The concerns span the gamut. There are calls for renewed antitrust investigations. Some people have accused the companies of political biases, while others have criticized their lack of diversity and how narrowly they distribute their wealth. Then there are the questions of their vulnerability to foreign influence and their capacity for addicting us to their products. In different ways, the companies have conceded some of these fears and have vowed to address them. Taking stock, cleaning up, admitting “moral responsibility” for their contributions to society — these are the buzzwords of a tech ecosystem that is supposedly subsumed by remorse and committed to rehabilitation. Yet there is something deeply incongruous at the heart of the supposed “techlash”: It is not really making a huge dent in the tech giants’ financial performance. Over the last two weeks, each of the five reported earnings that were brimming with mostly fantastic news for its investors. Amazon, which has long conditioned shareholders to expect a lot of growth but not much earnings, reported a record profit. Microsoft and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, both handily beat Wall Street’s projections. On Tuesday, so did Apple; if its price jumps as a result, it could become the first company to reach a market valuation of more than $1 trillion. Wait, but what about Facebook, which told investors to expect lower growth rates and higher expenses, causing its stock to lose $120 billion in market value in a single day? In a strange way, the social network’s troubles only underscored its dominance. Even after its stock crash, Facebook remains the fifth most valuable corporation in the American markets, ahead of Berkshire Hathaway, and there are almost no serious calls for its chief executive to resign, as you might expect for any other company experiencing such a loss. That’s because the company reported little to cause experts to alter their long-term outlook. Pretty much everyone who studies Facebook believes that it will hold its grip on the culture and the advertising industry for the foreseeable future. "
1046,"WASHINGTON — The White House is considering a second sharp reduction in the number of refugees who can be resettled in the United States, picking up where President Trump left off in 2017 in scaling back a program intended to offer protection to the world’s most vulnerable people, according to two former government officials and another person familiar with the talks. This time, the effort is meeting with less resistance from inside the Trump administration because of the success that Stephen Miller, the president’s senior policy adviser and an architect of his anti-immigration agenda, has had in installing allies in key positions who are ready to sign off on deep cuts. Last year, after a fierce internal battle that pitted Mr. Miller, who advocated a limit as low as 15,000, against officials at the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department and the Pentagon, Mr. Trump set the cap at 45,000, a historic low. Under one plan currently being discussed, no more than 25,000 refugees could be resettled in the United States next year, a cut of more than 40 percent from this year’s limit. It would be the lowest number of refugees admitted to the country since the creation of the program in 1980. The program’s fate could hinge on Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state. His department has traditionally been a strong advocate for the refugee program, but Mr. Pompeo is now being advised by two senior aides who are close to Mr. Miller and share his hard-line approach, according to the people briefed on the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to reveal internal deliberation about a decision that has yet to be completed. A White House official who also did not want to be identified declined to confirm or deny whether deep cuts to the program, including a cap of 25,000, were under consideration. But the official implicitly made the case for substantially reducing refugee admissions. A “migration crisis” was gripping the country, the official said, and the administration was instead prioritizing asylum cases in which a person is already in the United States and claims a credible fear of returning home. "
1047,"In June,  Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri asked voters at a big political dinner to stand up if they had a pre-existing health condition. She’d been hearing from voters at town hall meetings that they were worried about health care. “I just thought of it frankly at the podium,” she said. “I was just betting this is not that different from my town halls.” The room was suddenly filled with standing voters. “Even I was stunned just how few people kept their seats,” she said. Now, Ms. McCaskill asks the question at every event. A few weeks ago, she mentioned the experience to her colleague Joe Donnelly of Indiana, another Democratic senator in a close race for re-election this year. His version — asking coal workers at a Boonville, Ind., rally how many  knew someone with a pre-existing condition — “really moved me,” Mr. Donnelly said. It has become a staple of his campaign events, too. After nearly a decade of playing defense on the issue, Democratic congressional candidates  around the country are putting a health care message at the center of their campaigns. After the Republicans’ failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Democrats have detected a newfound concern that the consumer protections established under the law might go away. And that fear has turned into a potent campaign theme. "

In recent days, responding to a flurry of news related to the Russia investigation, members of President Trump’s team have been making a two-pronged argument: They say that collusion is not a crime, but that it doesn’t matter anyway because Trump’s campaign never colluded with Russia. Trump tweeted to that effect on Wednesday. Stephen Colbert said that argument sounds like a non sequitur to him. Then Colbert played footage from various Trump speeches of the president saying, “No collusion.” A new public school founded — and largely funded — by LeBron James opened this week in Akron, Ohio. It’s an ambitious project that uses state-of-the-art techniques and resources to teach an underserved population. "
1049,"HONG KONG — In Thailand, a theater rigged with hydraulic seats will give moviegoers the sensation of flight. In Australia, an indoor ski slope is going up near the beaches of the Gold Coast. In the Czech Republic, a spa with Chinese medicine is under construction in the southern wine country. All three projects fall under Beijing’s ambitious effort to build geopolitical and economic ties around the world — and all three stray from its original mission. Under President Xi Jinping, Beijing has pledged trillions of dollars toward the construction of roads, power plants and ports in Asia, Africa and Europe through its Belt and Road initiative. The program envisions big, critical infrastructure projects, backed and blessed by the Chinese government, as the path to winning friends and spreading influence. But five years in, smaller, less impactful projects are finding cover under the umbrella of Belt and Road, using the program to slip past restrictions on foreign investment. Beijing has discouraged, and in some cases blocked, deals in the real estate and entertainment industries, part of a broader crackdown on profligate spending by Chinese companies overseas. As the economy shows signs of strain, Chinese officials are sounding caution about the program, taking a closer look at the financing of deals and the number of projects underway. That hasn’t discouraged some companies. “There are wacky deals that occur under the banner of Belt and Road because this is how every entrepreneur signals that they are in line with the leadership’s political objectives,” said Arthur Kroeber, managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, an independent economic research firm. "
1050,"WASHINGTON — Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, has referred three investigations into possible illicit foreign lobbying by Washington insiders to federal prosecutors in New York who are already handling the case against President Trump’s former lawyer, according to multiple people familiar with the cases. The cases cut across party lines, focusing on both powerful Democratic and Republican players in Washington, including one whom Mr. Trump has repeatedly targeted — the Democratic superlobbyist Tony Podesta. The cases are unlikely to provoke an outburst from Mr. Trump similar to the one he unleashed in April after prosecutors raided the home and office of Michael D. Cohen, then the president’s lawyer. But these cases do represent a challenge to Washington’s elite, many of whom have earned rich paydays lobbying for foreign interests. They also tie into the special counsel investigation of Mr. Trump: All three cases are linked to Paul Manafort, the president’s former campaign chairman, whose trial on financial fraud charges began Tuesday in Alexandria, Va. Mr. Manafort earned tens of millions of dollars lobbying for Ukrainian politicians with ties to Russia, and he drew other Washington lobbyists and lawyers into the work. Now, all three cases being taken on by the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan are examining whether those lobbyists failed to register as foreign agents, as is required by law, and how they were paid, said people familiar with the investigations. The cases involve Gregory B. Craig, who served as the White House counsel under President Barack Obama before leaving to work for the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; former Representative Vin Weber, Republican of Minnesota, who joined Mercury Public Affairs, a lobbying firm, after leaving Congress; and Tony Podesta, a high-powered Washington lobbyist whose brother, John D. Podesta, was the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. The three men have not been charged with any crimes, those familiar with the cases said. But the cases have progressed far enough that Mr. Mueller’s team had subpoenaed or requested documents from all three firms, starting last year, and his investigators had interviewed Mr. Craig, people familiar with the investigations said. "
1051,"SALT LAKE CITY — The progressive activists who gathered in Utah two weeks ago to strategize for the midterm elections could each recall a moment when they realized the Democratic Party was their foe and decided to quit it. For Kenneth Mejia, 27, who ran for Congress as a Democratic write-in candidate two years ago, it happened when the party declined to include policies that inspire him — like single payer health care and a ban on fracking — in its 2016 party platform. For Diane Moxley, 49, who canvassed for Barack Obama in 2008, it was when the Occupy Wall Street movement introduced her to others who shared her unease with the party’s acceptance of corporate donor money. And for Rodolfo Cortes Barragan, 30, who wept when Al Gore lost the 2000 election, the moment came when Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton for president at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. It is an event he calls “the Wells Fargo Center incident,” named for the convention’s location. All three are now members of the Green Party, the leftists often accused of spoiling presidential elections for the Democrats. Each of them is now running for Congress in a year when young liberal activists have energized the Democratic Party, which increasingly echoes Green Party goals on issues like health care and campaign finance. But the Greens want no part of the Democratic Party’s ascendant left wing: As much as they may loathe President Trump, they say several issues — including corporate donations and support for capitalism — have rendered both the Democrats and the Republican Party rotten to the core. "
1052,"In an effort to shed more light on how we work, The Times is running a series of short posts explaining some of our journalistic practices. Read more of this series here. President Trump has ignored bedrock diplomatic alliances. He has stared directly into an eclipse. His disregard for the “off” part of an off-the-record meeting would seem to surprise exactly no one. But the president’s decision to speak publicly about his recent private discussion with A.G. Sulzberger, the publisher of The New York Times, has prompted questions from some readers: What does “off the record” really mean? How does it work in practice? This particular case was straightforward, in theory. At the request of the White House, both parties agreed not to talk about their July 20 meeting publicly. Then Mr. Trump tweeted merrily about the encounter anyway. And then, with the agreement voided by Mr. Trump’s comments, The Times responded by challenging his version of events. While these exact circumstances — a sitting president placing a private meeting on the record on a whim — are uncommon, wrangling over the terms of a given conversation is a constant concern for many journalists. As a national political reporter for The Times, I have heard all manner of after-the-fact pleading from politicians who regretted their words. "
1053,"Let me first state that I actually like Mark Zuckerberg and have since the day I met him more than a dozen years ago. But let me also say that he and Facebook, the huge social network that he started in college, have been working humanity’s last nerve for far too long now. Every week, it’s something, and that something is never good. This week, it was the revelation that the Russians — or, more precisely, a group of geek thugs who are acting the exact same way that a group of Russians acted when they messed with the 2016 United States elections on Facebook — are still skulking around the platform and making trouble for the midterms. This comes as no surprise to anyone at this point, except for maybe President Trump. I suppose we should be grateful that this time it was Facebook’s management that revealed the news, in a departure from the company’s previous stance of stubbornly resisting pressure from the government and the media to be more transparent. (Over the past months, it has copped to trouble in Brazil, Mexico and Russia, which is a good sign, although a report on Sunday from Britain’s Parliament rebuked the company for being “unwilling or unable to give full answers to the committee’s questions.”) In a post about the latest disinformation campaign, the company said about security challenges: “We face determined, well-funded adversaries who will never give up and are constantly changing tactics. It’s an arms race and we need to constantly improve too.” The arms race metaphor is a good one, but not for the reasons Facebook intended. Here’s how I see it: Facebook, as well as Twitter and Google’s YouTube, have become the digital arms dealers of the modern age. "
1054,"Even as new evidence surfaces that someone, probably in Russia, is meddling with another American election, we can forget about strict punishment from sanctions for at least one of the Russian oligarchs closest to President Vladimir Putin. This week, the Trump administration further eased its pressure on Rusal, Russia’s largest aluminum company, less than four months after sanctions on it and its notorious leader were imposed. Even as the White House seems willing to inflict pain on American farmers and consumers with its trade wars, Russian aluminum workers are apparently worthy of special protection. Rusal is controlled by Oleg Deripaska, a member of Mr. Putin’s inner circle. As the Treasury Department acknowledges, he has been investigated for money laundering and accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally wiretapping a government official and taking part in extortion and racketeering. There are also allegations, made public by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, that Mr. Deripaska bribed a government official, ordered the murder of a businessman and had links to a Russian organized crime group. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Paul Manafort, then Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, tried to offer Mr. Deripaska private briefings about the campaign. On Tuesday, Mr. Manafort went on trial on charges of bank and tax fraud not directly related to the campaign. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said he is considering lifting the sanctions altogether because they are punishing the “hardworking people of Rusal.” But Mr. Mnuchin has it backward. If he was truly concerned about Rusal’s 61,000 employees, he would not relent until the company fully washed its hands of Mr. Deripaska and the corrupt regime the aluminum giant serves. Behind Mr. Deripaska’s estimated fortune of as much as $5.3 billion, there stands a great crime. During the “aluminum wars” of the 1990s, when that economic sector was consolidating in the chaotic privatization that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, the young metals trader was suspected of ties to gangsters as he seized control of huge Siberian smelters. According to testimony by a gang member in Stuttgart, Germany, part of Mr. Deripaska’s value to the group were his links to Russia’s security services. While his rivals were killed off or fled Russia, Mr. Deripaska somehow emerged as the director general of Rusal, a company that reported revenues last year of nearly $10 billion. But suspicions that the oligarch has had links to organized crime have denied him a visa to enter the United States. "

1056,"The Democratic Party is a traditional political organization dedicated to winning elections. It is also a social justice movement, the political home of societal change. The party has often been further out front on these issues than the public at large — and than many of its own voters. This has empowered the Republican Party, from Richard Nixon to Donald Trump, to capitalize on opposition to a range of liberal Democratic initiatives on immigration, busing, women’s rights, abortion, crime, gay rights, gun control, affirmative action and so on. The Democratic Party’s commitment to newly ascendant — and often assertive — constituencies has alienated some middle and working class voters who see their own values and interests downgraded. Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, voiced this critique in an analysis of the 2016 election: While whites are a declining share of voters, they still constitute 60 percent of the Democratic Party, according to Gallup. Data provided by Pew Research shows that whites were 74 percent of all voters in 2016. David Hopkins, a political scientist at Boston College, responding to my inquiry about the dual role of the Democratic Party, made a point related to Greenberg’s, but approached it from a different angle: Hopkins noted that The tension between the center and the fervent anti-corporate, anti-Wall Street wing of the party — Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and now Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — has amplified intraparty conflict. While some centrist Democrats and organizations with which they are allied view economic populists as an electoral liability, they are, among other things, crucial to keeping within the Democratic fold a bloc of voters who can drift in small but significant numbers to third-party candidates, like Jill Stein in 2016 and Ralph Nader in 2000, who arguably prevented Democratic candidates from winning the presidency. "
1057,"Message to those in the news media who keep calling Donald Trump a “populist”: I do not think that word means what you think it means. It’s true that Trump still, on occasion, poses as someone who champions the interests of ordinary working Americans against those of the elite. And I guess there’s a sense in which his embrace of white nationalism gives voice to ordinary Americans who share his racism but have felt unable to air their prejudice in public. But he’s been in office for a year and a half, time enough to be judged on what he does, not what he says. And his administration has been relentlessly anti-worker on every front. Trump is about as populist as he is godly — that is, not at all. Start with tax policy, where Trump’s major legislative achievement is a tax cut that mainly benefits corporations — whose tax payments have fallen off a cliff — and has done nothing at all to raise wages. The tax plan does so little for ordinary Americans that Republicans have stopped campaigning on it. Yet the administration is floating the (probably illegal) idea of using executive action to cut taxes on the rich by an extra $100 billion. There’s also health policy, where Trump, having failed to repeal Obamacare — which would have been a huge blow to working families — has engaged instead in a campaign of sabotage that has probably raised premiums by almost 20 percent relative to what they would have been otherwise. Inevitably, the burden of these higher premiums falls most heavily on families earning just a bit too much to be eligible for subsidies, that is, the upper part of the working class. And then there’s labor policy, where the Trump administration has moved on multiple fronts to do away with regulations that had protected workers from exploitation, injury and more. "
1058,"Included in nearly all the commentary about the Supreme Court’s 2017-18 term was the observation that this was the year that Justice Anthony M. Kennedy took a decided turn to the right. For the first time in memory, there was not a single case in which the current court’s longest-serving justice, who announced his retirement on the term’s final day in June, joined the court’s four liberals to make a 5-to-4 majority. Considering Justice Kennedy’s recent record, along with the indisputably conservative credentials of the man President Trump has chosen to replace him, it’s tempting to shrug and wonder what the fuss over Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination is about, or to assume that not much will change when he’s confirmed. After all, isn’t the Supreme Court’s future already here? That we are in for years — decades, perhaps — of conservative dominance on the Supreme Court there is little doubt. But I want to frame a different question about the court’s future. What will that conservatism look like? What does a conservative future really mean? It’s going on 50 years since Warren E. Burger, President Richard Nixon’s chosen chief justice and the first of his four Supreme Court appointees, took his seat in June 1969, initiating the turn to the right that continues to this day. Admittedly, it’s been a fitful journey rather than a steady march. Different expressions of conservatism have been on display, including the states-rights revival under Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist; the “originalism” of Justice Antonin Scalia and, currently, the grumpy the-prosecution-is-never-wrong-and-the-government-is-always-right jurisprudence of Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. Against this backdrop, I want to focus on Justice Clarence Thomas and specifically on the record he compiled during the past term. There is something almost discordant about including Justice Thomas in a discussion of “the future” because his highly personal and eccentric jurisprudence would take the court and the Constitution hurtling backward into the past. That’s no great revelation. He has long insisted that the only legitimate way to interpret a constitutional provision is to give it the “public meaning” it supposedly had at the time it was written. So in 2011, for example, he dissented from a majority opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia that struck down, on First Amendment grounds, a California law that made it a crime to sell a “violent” video game to a minor without parental permission. “The founding generation,” Justice Thomas wrote in dissent, “would not have considered it an abridgment of ‘the freedom of speech’ to support parental authority by restricting speech that bypasses minor’s parents.” "

1060,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Robert Mueller’s investigation of the millions of dollars that are flowing into Washington from abroad could be as much a part of his legacy as special counsel as anything he might unearth about Russian election interference. The case of Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign manager who is facing fraud charges, is one of several that have spotlighted foreign influence operations embedded in Washington, and the culture of lobbyists who get rich helping foreign clients affect policies and laws. At Mr. Manafort’s trial on Wednesday, Mr. Mueller’s team detailed Mr. Manafort’s lavish spending, including more than $900,000 in five years at a men’s wear boutique in Manhattan. The judge, however, told prosecutors to focus on the alleged financial machinations that they claim made such a lifestyle possible. • President Trump pressed Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday to end the special counsel’s Russia investigation, which the president, again, called a “rigged witch hunt.” Mr. Trump has also pushed his lawyers in recent days to try to organize an interview with Mr. Mueller. • The Trump administration has announced its long-awaited proposal to dramatically weaken an Obama-era regulation on planet-warming vehicle tailpipe pollution.

1061,"ROME — Pope Francis has declared the death penalty wrong in all cases, a definitive change in church teaching that is likely to challenge Catholic politicians, judges and officials who have argued that their church was not entirely opposed to capital punishment. Before, church doctrine accepted the death penalty if it was “the only practicable way” to defend lives, an opening that some Catholics took as license to support capital punishment in many cases. But Francis said executions were unacceptable in all cases because they are “an attack” on human dignity, the Vatican announced on Thursday, adding that the church would work “with determination” to abolish capital punishment worldwide. Francis made the change to the Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church, the book of doctrine that is taught to Catholic children worldwide and studied by adults in a church with 1.2 billion members. Abolishing the death penalty has long been one of his top priorities, along with saving the environment and caring for immigrants and refugees.

1062,"YOUNGSTOWN, Pa. — The two-story house, painted like an American flag and with a giant Trump lawn sign, was a semifamous roadside attraction in 2016. Hundreds of people detoured an hour outside Pittsburgh to take pictures there, and Donald Trump himself tweeted an image of the “Trump House.” Now another election season is underway, and Lou Barletta, a congressman and the Republican candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania, has cast himself in the Trump mold, hoping to win statewide the way the president did. The Trump House is still in the same place. But the voters may not be. Across the street, three factory workers on a lunch break last week said they had not even heard of Mr. Barletta, who forged his political identity as the mayor of a small city at the other end of the state that he vowed to make “one of the toughest places in the United States” for illegal immigrants. A few blocks down Latrobe Street at the Tin Lizzy Tap Room, Bob Lihan, a retired brewery worker, said that though he thought Mr. Trump was “doing great,” he planned to vote for Mr. Barletta’s Democratic opponent, Senator Bob Casey Jr., in the fall — that is, if he votes at all. Mr. Trump’s strategy for keeping Congress in Republican hands has been to excite his base to turn out at the polls in close House and Senate races. That has meant — more than any other issue — pushing his hard line on immigration, whether by accusing Democrats of trying to “infest” the country with illegal immigrants, or by threatening to shut down the government over money for “the wall.” But Mr. Barletta’s campaign is lagging far behind Mr. Casey’s in the polls and in fund-raising, even though he is one of the biggest immigration hawks in Congress. His struggles illustrate how Mr. Trump’s lightning-in-a-bottle victory may not be easy to duplicate this year in swing states like Pennsylvania. "
1063,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The longstanding feud between old and new in San Francisco has found a fresh battleground: lunch. In a move meant to wrest tech workers from their increasingly luxurious offices, two members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors have proposed an ordinance to ban new corporate offices from including cafeterias. They hope this would force workers to mingle socially with others in the city and support local restaurants, which sprung up around tech headquarters only to find disappointing traffic. Aaron Peskin, a sponsor of the measure, said he knew it was a “nanny state” ordinance, but countered that all zoning is exactly that. To live in San Francisco in 2018 is a vexing situation. The streets can be alarming scenes of human misery. The rents are astronomical. The ideas coming out of warehouses and bedrooms may be brilliant, but they never seem to improve the spaces we all share. And tensions continue to rise. One grocer said the in-office amenities had gotten so extreme, workers aren’t just getting free meals: They’re fully grocery shopping in their offices, though for him the bigger worry by far is street crime. Tech workers say the old city created this problem for itself. By blocking new housing development even as its courted corporate headquarters, the city’s leadership forced workers to spend all their money on rent, and so of course they want free office food, they say.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Thursday put forth its long-awaited proposal to freeze antipollution and fuel-efficiency standards for cars, significantly weakening one of President Barack Obama’s signature policies to combat global warming. The proposed new rules would also challenge the right of states, California in particular, to set their own, more stringent tailpipe pollution standards. That would set the stage for a legal clash that could ultimately split the nation’s auto market in two. The administration’s plans immediately faced opposition from an unusual mix of critics — including not only environmentalists and consumer groups but auto-industry representatives as well as individual states — who are now launching efforts to change the plan before it is finalized. The plan, jointly published by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department, would roll back a 2012 rule that required automakers to nearly double the fuel economy of passenger vehicles to an average of about 54 miles per gallon by 2025. It would halt requirements that automakers build cleaner, more fuel-efficient cars including hybrids and electric vehicles. That Obama-era rule, which aimed to cut the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions while reducing oil consumption, was opposed by automakers who said it was overly burdensome. However, Thursday’s proposal goes much further than many major automakers wanted, and manufacturers are now worried that years of legal challenges and regulatory uncertainty could complicate their business. "
1065,"WASHINGTON — Can we improve fuel economy without sacrificing vehicle safety? That’s one contentious issue at the center of the debate over federal fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks. The Obama administration concluded the answer was yes and issued strict rules in 2012 that would have required automakers to roughly double the fuel economy of new cars, S.U.V.s and pickup trucks by 2025. But the Trump administration, in its big new proposal to roll back those rules, is now arguing the opposite: Forcing automakers to build cleaner cars will lead to more highway accidents and deaths. The administration contends that scrapping the Obama-era standards after 2021 would prevent more than 12,700 deaths from road accidents over the following decade, compared with keeping the standards in place. To support this claim, the proposal makes three main arguments. First, people who buy fuel-efficient vehicles will end up driving more, increasing the odds that they will get into a crash. Second, the fuel-efficient vehicles will themselves be more expensive, slowing the rate at which people buy newer vehicles with advanced safety features. Third, automakers will have to make their cars lighter in response to rising standards, slightly hurting safety. These arguments have been greeted with skepticism by outside experts who reviewed an earlier draft of the proposal. “I don’t know how they are going to defend this analysis,” said Antonio M. Bento, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Southern California whose research is cited throughout the document. “I just don’t think it’s correct.” "
1066,"The economic expansion in the United States celebrated its ninth birthday last month. If it survives another year, it will be the longest on record. But eventually something will kill it. The question is what, and when. While it’s impossible to predict the details or timing of the next recession with any confidence, we can identify some emerging threats to the expansion — and with a bit of imagination, picture how the recession of 2020 (or 2022, or whatever year it ends up being) may unfold. To be clear, the economy is going gangbusters right now. The nation’s G.D.P. rose at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the second quarter, the strongest quarter of growth since 2014. But when you speak with some of the people who fret and worry about economic risks for a living, a few factors come up repeatedly. Perhaps most worrisome, many of the culprits in ending the expansion wouldn’t necessarily arise in isolation. Rather, each one could make the others worse, meaning the next recession might have multiple causes. So, with a bit of creative license, here are the three most plausible scenarios for the good times to end. The Federal Reserve has had a relatively easy time over the last year or two. Both inflation and employment have been gradually moving toward healthy levels as the Fed has gradually raised interest rates. "

1070,"To the Editor: Re “Our National Parks: Breathtaking and Polluted” (nytimes.com, July 23): When we think about places like Yellowstone and Acadia, we envision unspoiled landscapes and scenic views. That’s no longer a reality. As your article highlights, some of our most iconic landscapes are plagued by significant air pollution comparable with densely populated cities like Los Angeles. This pollution threatens the health of park visitors, wildlife and neighboring communities, and ruins our views with hazy skies. For years, the National Parks Conservation Association has been working to reduce dirty air in our parks with help from federal policies that protect the air we breathe. The Trump administration is taking the opposite approach, actively working to roll back rules meant to reduce pollution from coal plants, cars, and oil and gas development. We must make clean air a priority, and that includes enforcing laws, like the Clean Air Act and the Regional Haze Rule, that work to clean the air we breathe for the safety and health of people and our national parks.

1071,"WASHINGTON — Top national security officials vowed Thursday to defend American elections against what they called real threats from Russia only weeks after President Trump seemed to accept President Vladimir V. Putin’s denials of interference during a summit meeting in Finland. After the meeting, Mr. Trump said he had not meant to endorse Mr. Putin’s denial of election meddling, but insisted that the culprit behind the intrusion“could be other people.” A few days later, he asserted that the idea of any meddling by Russia was “all a big hoax.” But the men and women charged with detecting and defending against any threats to the American political process showed no such ambivalence. They bluntly said that Russia was behind a “pervasive” campaign to weaken America’s democracy and influence the 2018 election. They also sought to reassure voters that federal, state and local governments were taking steps to guard against what Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, described as a “24-7 365-days-a-year” effort by Russia to sow division as Americans head to the polls in the fall. “Russia attempted to interfere with the last election,” Mr. Wray told reporters in the White House briefing room, “and continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day. This is a threat we need to take extremely seriously and to tackle and respond to with fierce determination and focus.” Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, echoed that assessment, saying that “Russians are looking for every opportunity, regardless of party, regardless of whether or not it applies to the election, to continue their pervasive efforts to undermine our fundamental values.” "
1072,"Tennessee primary voters on Thursday will choose which candidates to send to the general election. Democrats hope that the governorship and a Senate seat may be up for grabs, and the state, which President Trump won by 26 points in 2016, also has three open House seats. Polls close at 8 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time and 7 p.m. Central Daylight Time. We will have results shortly after. Tennessee Republicans are wrapping up a bitter, expensive campaign for governor, with four leading candidates vying to replace Gov. Bill Haslam: U.S. Representative Diane Black; Beth Harwell, the speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives; Randy Boyd, a former state economic development commissioner; and Bill Lee, a businessman. Haslam cannot seek re-election because of term limits. Each candidate has been heaping praise on Mr. Trump and attacking the others as insufficiently loyal to the president. The Associated Press estimated last week that roughly $45.7 million had been spent in the race. Last week, Vice President Mike Pence endorsed Ms. Black, who could become the state’s first female governor if she wins in November. "
1073,"President Trump likes to claim that his meetings with foreign leaders are one huge victory after another in promoting his worldview. The reality is usually far different, but measured by this yardstick, his meeting with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy was a smashing success. Standing alongside the president in the White House East Room, Mr. Conte sang praises to Mr. Trump for “positions and stances which are expressed with clarity,” and offered to be his “privileged interlocutor” in Europe. Mr. Trump was equally effusive, congratulating Mr. Conte on his “tremendous victory in Italy” and finding parallels between the Italian’s rise and his own: “We’re both outsiders to politics — can you believe it?” In fact, Mr. Conte, a law professor, never won any election and is prime minister solely as the malleable compromise choice of two anti-establishment parties that formed a coalition of convenience after elections in March. Such nettlesome facts aside, the love-fest between Mr. Trump and the new Italian government marks another step in the evolving network of right-wing, populist governments in Europe and the United States, with demonization of immigrants as their major bond, followed by admiration for President Vladimir Putin of Russia, an aversion to the European Union and disdain for political elites. To Mr. Trump, Mr. Conte’s accession to power was further evidence of the consequences of a tide of illegal immigrants. “Like the United States, Italy is currently under enormous strain as a result of illegal immigration,” Mr. Trump declared. “And the prime minister, frankly, is with us today because of illegal immigration. Italy got tired of it.” Italy, of course, has a far more tangible problem than the United States as one of the first destinations of migrants from Africa and the Middle East trying to reach Europe by perilous crossings of the Mediterranean. About 600,000 migrants are believed to have reached Italy over the past four years, a challenge compounded by the failure of the European Union to form a cohesive joint policy on migration. If there is a similar “enormous strain” in the United States, it is largely a result of Mr. Trump’s incessant demagogy on the subject and his obsession with building a wall along the Mexican border. It was at his news conference with Mr. Conte that he declared his readiness to shut down the government if he didn’t get funding for the wall. "
1074,"A federal judge in Manhattan dismissed a lawsuit Thursday that was brought against Fox News by the parents of Seth Rich, the young Democratic aide whose unsolved murder was turned into fodder for a lingering right-wing conspiracy theory. In his dismissal of the lawsuit, Judge George B. Daniels said he sympathized with Mr. Rich’s parents, but added that they had not been personally defamed by the story — despite the fact that it included “false statements or misrepresentations.” Mr. Rich’s parents, Joel and Mary, filed the suit in Federal District Court in Manhattan in March, arguing that Fox News had caused them emotional distress and engaged in “extreme and outrageous conduct” by publishing a fabricated article claiming that their son had leaked thousands of internal emails from the Democratic National Committee to WikiLeaks. Those emails were then released to the public in an act that proved damaging to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. The story, published on the Fox News website on May 16, 2017, implied that Mr. Rich’s death on the streets on Washington in July 2016 had occurred in retaliation for the leaks, even though no evidence supported that conclusion. Mr. Rich’s parents held that Mr. Rich — then 27 — had been killed during an attempted robbery. Within a week, Fox News retracted the story, saying that it had not met its standards, but the conspiracy theory has persisted, fueled by prominent conservatives like Newt Gingrich, the Fox News pundit Sean Hannity and the right-wing broadcasters Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones of Infowars. The rumors about Mr. Rich’s death were embraced by some supporters of President Trump, who used them to undercut the notion that Russian operatives had been responsible for the leak. “It is understandable that plaintiffs might feel that their grief and personal loss were taken advantage of, and that the tragic death of their son was exploited for political purposes,” Judge Daniels wrote. But he added that he had no choice but to dismiss the suit, because Fox’s conduct did not amount to the intentional infliction of emotional distress. "

The play, which explores the anxieties of the working class in Middle America, will embark on a free monthlong run through 18 cities this fall as part of the Public Theater’s Mobile Unit initiative. “Sweat” takes place in the bar of a Pennsylvania factory town, where several generations grapple with plant closures, changing demographics and racial tensions. The play opened at the Public Theater in 2016 before transferring to Broadway the following year; it struggled at the box office but was critically lauded, earning three Tony nominations and the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The play will now embark across the country through the Public Theater’s Mobile Unit, an initiative that stages free performances to underserved communities across New York City. Oskar Eustis, the Public’s artistic director, described the effort in a statement as the theater’s “most dramatic attempt to break out of our New York bubble and speak to those who the nonprofit theater has largely ignored: the rural communities of the upper Midwest.” In the weeks before the 2018 midterm elections, the tour will stop by 18 counties where the 2016 election was closely contested; all but four swung toward President Trump. The first performance is in Erie County, Pennsylvania on Sept. 27. The tour then will go through Ohio, Michigan and Minnesota before ending in Sawyer County, Wisconsin on Oct. 23. But Mr. Eustis says the goal isn’t to support a specific political doctrine. “Our job isn’t to change anyone’s vote,” he said in an email. “It’s to open a dialogue and do our part to remind all Americans of what we have in common.” Community workshops and art projects aimed at exploring local issues will be held alongside the performances. The tour’s cast will include Carlo Albán, who played the role of Oscar both at the Public and on Broadway. Funding was provided by the Ford Foundation and The Andrew W.

Here’s what you need to know: • The Trump administration released a proposal to drastically weaken Obama-era rules that would have sharply increased auto fuel efficiency and therefore reduced greenhouse gas emissions from one of the world’s largest producers. A mix of state governments, environmentalists and consumer groups is fighting the plan. And even the automakers who had complained about the expense of raising fuel efficiency plan to lobby for changes, fearing that legal challenges could leave them in limbo, or split the domestic market into more and less stringent sectors. The administration sought to emphasize that lighter, more efficient cars would be more dangerous in crashes, but experts dispute that. _____ • The trillion-dollar company.

1078,"WASHINGTON — For much of the past year, as President Trump has belittled NATO, sought warmer relations with the Kremlin and questioned his own intelligence services about Russia’s election interference campaign, Congress’s response has been little more than rhetorical. A bipartisan group of influential senators is proposing to change that. Led by Senator Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, the group introduced legislation late on Wednesday to impose “crushing” new punishments on President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his associates. The bill would also cut off Mr. Trump’s ability to remove the United States from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization without the support of the Senate and write into law new international deterrence programs meant to serve as a governmentwide response to Russian aggression. The legislation, which counts Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and three prominent Democrats among its supporters, is one of the biggest efforts to date by Congress to wrestle back some authority to shape foreign policy. Its authors said senators from both parties were already asking to sponsor the measure. Whether it could actually become law is another question. Republican leaders on Capitol Hill have been averse to intervening too aggressively in Mr. Trump’s decisions. The House’s monthlong recess, a booked legislative agenda for the fall and the impending midterm elections will certainly not help. And there are other sanctions already under consideration. The most frequently discussed — a measure written by Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland — would in essence put Russia on notice, threatening it with broad-based economic sanctions if it carried out an attack on November’s midterms. On Thursday, top national security officials made a rare appearance at a White House news briefing where they described an active campaign by Russia to influence and disrupt the midterm elections. The officials, including the director of national intelligence and the heads of the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security, said Russia tried to interfere in the last election and that it was working to undermine this fall’s vote, as well. "
1079,"WASHINGTON — Ivanka Trump appeared on Thursday to break step with two of the most contentious issues surrounding her father’s administration: She disagreed with President Trump’s position that the press is the enemy of the people, and she said the administration’s hard-line stance on immigration that resulted in separating children from their parents was a “low point” during her time in the White House. When asked during an interview with the news site Axios whether she shared her father’s vitriol for the news media, Ms. Trump, a senior adviser to the president, said, “I do not.” Mr. Trump feels the news media cover him unfavorably and has repeatedly complained about the press since his candidacy. He recently has ramped up his attacks, particularly in front of angry crowds of supporters at rallies and in his Twitter posts. Ms. Trump, the president’s eldest daughter, said in the interview that she shared some of his complaints about the media, but stopped short of condemning journalists. “I’ve certainly received my fair share of reporting on me personally that I know not to be fully accurate, so I have some sensitivity around why people have concerns and gripe, especially when they’re sort of targeted,” Ms. Trump said. “But no, I do not feel that the media is the enemy of the people.” With her comments on the media, Ms. Trump became the lone senior administration official to publicly say that she did not share the president’s view. Her statement stood in contrast to a news briefing held later that day by Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. "
1080,"CARSON CITY, Nev. — I will always remember where I was on July 19, 1979. Six months earlier, my mom and I had arrived in the United States, fleeing the violence of the Somoza regime in Nicaragua. I was 8 years old. It was a beautiful summer day in San Francisco. My friends and I were skateboarding on the courtyard of our apartment complex when my friend’s mom came out and said: “Somoza is gone.” I was 9 years old when we returned to Nicaragua. Everything was different. You could still see the war scars in the town I was from. A whole city block was gone after Somoza’s aircraft bombed it. It was never rebuilt. We called it “la manzana bombardeada,” or the bombed city block, and used it as a landmark for directions. Yet despite the destruction, there was a feeling of excitement, of possibility, of freedom. The revolution ushered in a brief period of social and economic reforms. In 1980, the Sandinista government started the National Literacy Crusade with the objective to wipe out illiteracy in the country. Between March and August, thousands of Nicaraguan volunteers went to the rural areas to teach people how to read and write. My mom was one of those volunteers. A college-educated teacher with years of experience, she oversaw a team of teachers. I would visit her on weekends, as she had been posted to a town that was only about an hour away by bus from where we lived. I’d tag along on her supervisory rounds, and I learned to appreciate what she was doing, and how important it was. My mom became wary of Sandinismo soon after the Literacy Crusade. While she felt the initial surge of enthusiasm, there were red flags early on. First was the book purge, where the books written in English were taken out of her school library and burned because English was considered to be the language of the imperialist. Then there were the attacks on the Catholic Church and the priests, which my mom, as a Catholic, could not abide. Finally, one day I came home from school and told her how a young woman from the Sandinista Children’s Association had visited our classroom to invite us to join. She had made it sound appealing, like joining the Girl Scouts. She told us that it would be our duty to be vigilant and report any counterrevolutionary talk, even by our parents. “That’s what a good Sandinista child does.” My mom forbade me from joining. She said, “In this family, we do not spy on our neighbors, our family or our friends.” "

__________ The Trump administration has added a new risk to companies planning to go public: a trade war. Sonos’s debut on the public markets this week did not go smoothly. On Thursday, its first day of trading, Sonos’s stock was up more than 20 percent. But that was only after Sonos, which makes smart speakers, cut the price of its initial public offering on Wednesday. It sold 13.9 million shares to investors at $15 apiece, well below the range of $17 to $19 that the company had predicted in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week. Concerns that Sonos could get caught in President Trump’s escalating trade fight with China may have helped dampen demand for the company’s shares. Increasing investor concern about tariffs has hit stocks in recent weeks. Shares of Whirlpool, Alcoa and General Motors tumbled after the companies warned of the financial hit from the higher costs related in part to the Trump administration’s tariffs on steel and aluminum. So far, the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the United States and China have had little impact on Sonos, the company said. But as trade tensions ramp up, Sonos looks particularly vulnerable. "
1083,"To justify rolling back auto gas mileage and emissions rules, the Trump administration has fabricated a false conflict between safety and improved fuel economy. The administration is wrong. Americans must have both, and can. Encouraged by automakers to roll back President Barack Obama’s stringent fuel-efficiency rules, the administration unveiled a proposal on Thursday doing just that. Its preferred option: bringing progress to a halt by requiring no further mileage improvements in new cars and light trucks beyond 2020. As written, the original standard would cut tailpipe pollution in half and deliver a new-car fleet in 2025 averaging an estimated 36 miles per gallon in real-world driving, equivalent to about 50 m.p.g. in test conditions. It is the biggest single step any nation has taken to fight climate change. The Trump plan would lower that average to 29 m.p.g. on the road and spew an additional 2.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide, the key global warming pollutant, by 2040, according to estimates by the Union of Concerned Scientists. The administration’s plan cooks the books: It claims clean-car technology would cost far more than the Obama team projected. It assumes that higher sticker prices for new cars will keep Americans in older, less safe vehicles. And it predicts they will drive far more miles than in the past — 1.3 trillion more than an exhaustive Obama administration analysis forecast, thus exposing them to greater risk. The administration is ignoring three central facts: Savings at the pump greatly outweigh the cost of gas-saving technology. Because cars and light trucks would need less gas, an average owner would save nearly $6,000 over the life of a 2025 vehicle under the Obama plan, even after paying for the gas-saving technology. (Since the Obama targets took effect in 2012, consumers have saved more than $60 billion.) Consumers haven’t balked at buying cleaner vehicles with advanced technology, despite slightly higher prices. Even as the standard has grown increasingly tough, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers has bragged of the industry’s “unprecedented seven-year growth trend.” The Consumer Federation of America reports that consistent new-car sales of nearly 17 million a year are outpacing the annual retirement of roughly 13 million older vehicles.

1084,"FRANKFURT — Higher prices. Disrupted supply chains. Wavering exports. Those are some of the ways that some of Europe’s biggest companies have been affected by President Trump’s trade war, offering a preview of how tensions in global commerce could begin to ripple through the European economy. As companies like BMW, Siemens and Volkswagen reported otherwise solid earnings this week, they warned that Mr. Trump’s aggressive stance on trade presented them with a host of new risks, which may already be acting as a drag on growth. The president’s tariffs have not just raised the costs of materials like steel, they have also diverted trade worldwide and warped the complex global supply systems that businesses rely on. Here in Europe, there are signs of strain, which, along with risks ranging from Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union to the excessive debt loads of Italy and Greece, are piling pressure on the region’s economy. Beyond the direct effect of Mr. Trump’s policies, surveys in both the United States and Europe show that businesses are nervous about the fragile détente reached in late July between Mr. Trump and the region he had referred to only a few weeks earlier as a “foe.” When managers are afraid, they may cancel or delay investments in new equipment or expansion, hurting companies like Siemens, the German industrial goods giant, whose products include technology to operate factories or manage buildings. Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of Siemens, acknowledged a risk that “all the noise will scare away the confidence of our customers.” “Investment is about trust,” Mr. Kaeser told reporters Thursday as Siemens reported a fall in quarterly profit that helped cause the company’s shares to slump nearly 5 percent. It was, he added, about “predictability.” "
1085,"To be a Republican is to oppose socialism. That opposition is practically encoded in the party’s DNA. Yet under Republican Party rule, socialism, or at least the conversation about it, is thriving. Although true-blooded socialists — Democratic Socialists, to be precise — remain a relatively small niche within the Democratic Party, they are having a visible impact on the party’s agenda, with nearly every likely 2020 presidential contender embracing Medicare for all. Bernie Sanders’s 2016 campaign galvanized progressive support for the idea of Democratic Socialism, and this year, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has embraced not only the label but also a blue-sky vision of American socialism — free public college, a jobs guarantee, guaranteed family leave and more — unbound by moderate liberal worries about government overreach or overspending. That Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s brand of expansive, expensive socialism has found this moment so conducive to its popularity is no accident. Its rise has been uniquely fueled by President Trump, who as both a businessman and a politician has embodied a cartoon version of rapacious capitalism.   But it has also been emboldened by more conventional aspects of the Republican agenda, in particular the party’s astoundingly hypocritical approach to debt and deficits. You may remember a time when Republicans pretended to care about the debt and deficits. That time was not so long ago, when Barack Obama was president. Under Mr. Obama, Paul Ryan, the outgoing speaker of the House, repeatedly blasted the president for declining to manage the federal budget. In 2012, he told the Republican National Convention that “in this generation, a defining responsibility of government is to steer our nation clear of a debt crisis while there is still time.” A year earlier, Senator Mitch McConnell called the federal debt “the nation’s most serious long-term problem.” Over and over, Republicans cast Mr. Obama’s unusually high deficits and additions to the national debt as a profound social menace, a form of budgetary terrorism that threatened the country’s future.

1086,"To the Editor: I have staunchly liberal political views, but Rhonda Garelick’s July 27 Op-Ed essay, “Ivanka’s Aspirations,” which describes Ivanka Trump products as “aspirational” clothes that ape their betters (Chanel, Prada, etc.) but are “poorly made,” and draws comparisons with fascism, left me with a sense of what some frustrated Trump supporters might feel. Like many women, I’ve bought Ivanka Trump clothes and shoes not because I have a “craving for both status and community” or want to “fake it” till I “make it,” as Ms. Garelick puts it. I just liked her clothes, which were professional, flattering and well priced. Wearing an inexpensive blouse that’s polyester but looks like silk doesn’t make me a loser; it  reflects the real-world buying decisions that millions of women who want to look professional and put together on a budget make every day. Trump voters sometimes say they feel looked down upon by “elites.” I’m not voting for President Trump anytime soon, but thanks to Ms. Garelick, I now have a sense of how it feels to be on the receiving end of that snobbery.

1087,"DETROIT — A Palestinian-American woman in the Michigan legislature running in the mold of Bernie Sanders. The African-American president of the Detroit City Council, who is popular with unions. The white mayor of a nearby suburb, positioning himself as a pragmatist. Two black state senators from historically prominent political families. One of the most diverse Democratic congressional primaries of the year will reach a climax with voting on Tuesday. Yet it’s the competitive nature of the race that is a drastic adjustment for some residents, considering just how long political representation in this region has been almost singularly defined by one name: Conyers. Voters are choosing a successor to Representative John Conyers Jr., a legend in Detroit and one of the nation’s most powerful black leaders until he resigned in December amid allegations of sexual misconduct. His House district, the Michigan 13th, has been a base of African-American political, economic and civic power since he first won election in 1964, so much so that Mr. Conyers’s name remains one of the first things that comes up when his would-be successors go door-knocking on the campaign trail, both in Detroit and the surrounding metro area. [Update: Rashida Tlaib and Brenda Jones both won their Michigan primaries.] Besides electing a new member of Congress, many residents see Tuesday’s election as an opportunity to reshape the identity of the district, which is one of the poorest in the country and a shadow of its former self during Detroit’s heyday, in terms of population, homeownership and jobs. People speak less of choosing candidates based on traditional ideological lines, and more of selecting a new face of hope in a community that has been so defined by waves of economic and political tumult. “Something got lost in translation over that many decades,” said Will Miller, a community activist. “We love John Conyers, but our community — under his watch — turned into nothing.” Michelle Moncrief, a 59-year-old who said her Detroit home had been inundated with campaign literature, said it’s “time to let someone else get in there,” though she shuddered at the idea of a nonblack candidate winning the seat.

1088,"The Trump administration’s decision to try to weaken President Barack Obama’s landmark 2012 agreement to increase fuel efficiency and decrease global warming emissions from automobiles is dismaying on so many levels that it is hard to know where to begin. The proposal from the current administration would freeze the average fuel economy after 2021 at about 37 miles per gallon; the Obama-era rule would have required automakers to hit an average of about 54 miles per gallon by 2025. The Trump plan would also revoke a waiver that the federal government granted to California, which allows the state to set stricter standards because of its particular air pollution problems. Cars and trucks are currently the largest source of planet-warming emissions in the United States. The proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation sets up a protracted legal fight with California and the 13 other states, including New York and New Jersey, that have chosen to follow its stronger standards. The state’s waiver was authorized under the 1970 Clean Air Act and has been renewed dozens of times by the E.P.A. It is one more nail in the coffin of Mr. Obama’s climate strategy, and further increases the already long odds of reaching Mr. Obama’s pledge at the 2015 Paris summit on climate change to reduce America’s greenhouse gas emissions by more than a quarter below 2005 levels by 2025. Of the Trump plan, Gov. Jerry Brown of California said in a statement: “Under his reckless scheme, motorists will pay more at the pump, get worse gas mileage and breathe dirtier air. California will fight this stupidity in every conceivable way possible.” To justify the unjustifiable, the Trump administration is deploying a series of bogus arguments that freezing the Obama standards would prevent nearly 13,000 traffic fatalities. That number stands in stark contrast to the Obama administration’s conclusion that its standards would lower fatalities by 100. The Trump administration uses three dubious assumptions to reach its conclusion. First, it asserts that people who buy more fuel-efficient cars would drive more — about 1.3 trillion miles more than previous estimates — because it would be cheaper to do so and they would, thus, be at greater risk of accidents. This is what experts call the rebound effect, but few researchers say the effect is this strong. One scholar, Kenneth Gillingham, a Yale economist, whose work the government relied on to come up with its numbers, told The Times that the administration ignored more recent work that showed a much smaller effect. "
1089,"The singer-songwriter Josh Ritter has a line I sometimes quote to aspiring writers anxious about balancing their artistic ambitions with their desire for an audience. “I’m singing for the love of it,” Ritter proclaims in “Snow Is Gone,” “have mercy on the man who sings to be adored.” Do your thing, in other words, and let your fans find you on your home turf. Compromising your principles still doesn’t guarantee an audience, but you’ll always have to answer to your idea of yourself. Sermon’s over! Time to read. This week’s recommended titles offer up a handful of characters who refuse to pander to the crowd, from the prickly Princess Margaret (in Craig Brown’s unconventional biography) to the haughty fashionista Loulou de La Falaise (in Christopher Petkanas’s oral history) to the eccentric Keiko, protagonist of Sayaka Murata’s novel “Convenience Store Woman.” Times being what they are, we also suggest a book about the impact of the opioid crisis, and a graphic novel about the pathologies of race relations, and Michiko Kakutani’s look at the erosion of objective truth as a democratic value. Rounding things out are a couple of histories — one about milk, the other about anti-Semitic violence in Eastern Europe — and a clutch of debut novels worth tossing in your beach bag. Gregory Cowles
Senior Editor, Books CONVENIENCE STORE WOMAN, by Sayaka Murata. Translated from the Japanese by Ginny Tapley Takemori. (Grove, $20.) Keiko, the 36-year-old heroine of this small, elegant and deadpan novel from Japan, senses that society finds her strange, so she culls herself from the herd before anyone else can do it. She becomes an anonymous, long-term employee of a convenience store called Smile Mart. “She is a sort of wimple-free nun, the Smile Mart her convent,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. “I have mixed feelings about ‘Convenience Store Woman,’ but there is no doubt that it is a thrifty and offbeat exploration of what we must each leave behind to participate in the world.” NINETY-NINE GLIMPSES OF PRINCESS MARGARET, by Craig Brown. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $28.) In this unconventional look at the life of Princess Margaret — the younger sister of Queen Elizabeth and one of the 20th century’s great malcontents — Brown swoops at his subject from unexpected angles. It’s a Cubist portrait of the lady. The book is “gloriously truant,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. “Brown ignores all the starchy obligations of biography and adopts a form of his own to trap the past and ensnare the reader — even this reader, so determinedly indifferent to the royals. I ripped through the book with the avidity of Margaret attacking her morning vodka and orange juice.” DOPESICK: Dealers, Doctors, and the Drug Company That Addicted America, by Beth Macy. (Little, Brown, $28.) In her latest book, Macy, the author of “Factory Man” and “Truevine,” offers portraits of opioid users and a corporate and medical history of the epidemic from the mid-1990s to the current day. “Macy’s strengths as a reporter are on full display when she talks to people, gaining the trust of chastened users, grieving families, exhausted medical workers and even a convicted heroin dealer,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. “Macy captures an Appalachian landscape in a state of emergency and in the grip of disillusionment, but there’s little here that’s new. Indeed, that’s part of her point — not enough has changed.” "
1090,"GRAHAM, N.C. — Keith Sellars and his daughters were driving home from dinner at a Mexican restaurant last December when he was pulled over for running a red light. The officer ran a background check and came back with bad news for Mr. Sellars. There was a warrant out for his arrest. As his girls cried in the back seat, Mr. Sellars was handcuffed and taken to jail. His crime: Illegal voting. “I didn’t know,” said Mr. Sellars, who spent the night in jail before his family paid his $2,500 bond. “I thought I was practicing my right.” Mr. Sellars, 44, is one of a dozen people in Alamance County in North Carolina who have been charged with voting illegally in the 2016 presidential election. All were on probation or parole for felony convictions, which in North Carolina and many other states disqualifies a person from voting. If convicted, they face up to two years in prison. While election experts and public officials across the country say there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud, local prosecutors and state officials in North Carolina, Texas, Kansas, Idaho and other states have sought to send a tough message by filing criminal charges against the tiny fraction of people who are caught voting illegally. “That’s the law,” said Pat Nadolski, the Republican district attorney in Alamance County. “You can’t do it. If we have clear cases, we’re going to prosecute.” "
1091,"Los Angeles — The Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Transportation moved Thursday to fulfill President Trump’s promise to undo landmark Obama-era rules requiring automakers to steadily reduce greenhouse gas pollution from cars and trucks and improve fuel efficiency through 2025. Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, with the biggest share coming from cars and trucks. Yet the government now plans to freeze fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards indefinitely at levels set for 2020, thwarting progress on addressing climate change. To make sure it accomplishes that goal, the Trump administration also wants to strip California of its authority to set stricter greenhouse gas standards for vehicles sold within its borders, which the state is authorized to do under a longstanding provision of the Clean Air Act. California and about a dozen other states that follow its lead — and which together comprise over a third of the nation’s auto market — have vowed to implement their own greenhouse gas standards if the administration jettisons the federal ones. So a major legal battle looms that will do exactly what the auto industry doesn’t want — which is to create regulatory uncertainty as it plans future models. Though the E.P.A. approved California’s greenhouse gas standards in 2013, the agency now argues that they impermissibly conflict with another federal law, the Energy Policy Conservation Act. That law, passed in 1975 in response to the energy crisis, gives the Transportation Department the sole power to set standards “relating to fuel economy.” Because auto companies comply with California’s greenhouse gas standards primarily by improving fuel efficiency, the E.P.A. now says in an about-face that the standards are pre-empted by those Transportation Department regulations. On the same theory, California’s program to promote electric and hybrid vehicles would also be eliminated. If the Trump administration succeeds in scuttling the federal standards and neutralizing California, it could be the most significant setback for American progress on climate change so far under President Trump. Worse, this disastrous policy could continue well beyond his tenure. Future presidents could not simply undo the decision, if courts rule that the Trump administration’s interpretation of the law is categorically correct. In that case only Congress could restore California’s authority. "
1092,"SAN FRANCISCO — Pamela Ortiz Cerda vividly remembered the assignment six years ago from her Mexican-American history instructor at San Joaquin Delta College, a community college in Stockton, Calif. “He required voting for our class,” Ms. Ortiz Cerda said. Students were told to bring in voting ballot stubs as proof. “I assumed it was a joke, but to the whole class he said, ‘And for you, all you illegals, I’m going to have immigration waiting outside the class for you if you don’t have the stubs,’” she said. “As a teenager, straight out of high school, that’s terrifying.” Terrifying because Ms. Ortiz Cerda was undocumented herself, brought to the United States from Mexico when she was 9 by her parents, who sought a better life for the family. In a statement, San Joaquin Delta College said that it would be “almost impossible” to know what happened in the history class so many years ago, but said that in recent years the school had taken steps to support undocumented students. Ms. Ortiz Cerda, now 24, became an advocate for those like herself, and she is the program services coordinator at Skyline College’s Dream Center in San Bruno, Calif. "
1093,"How do you connect what you’re learning in the classroom with what’s going on in the world outside of school? That’s the question we first asked teenagers, and more than 1,200 answered, suggesting links between the news and the content they were studying: from “Their Eyes Were Watching God,” “Walden” and “To Kill a Mockingbird” to the Chandrasekhar Limit and the California gold rush. We liked what they had to say so much that we asked teachers a similar question, and answers poured in. Whitney Lawrence, an elementary school teacher from Texas, explains why making those connections is so important: “As educators, we are expected to walk into our classrooms and pretend that the social, political and environmental issues consuming the world outside of the classroom are not taking place. We are to continue on, teaching our mandated state standards and steer clear of ‘controversial topics.’ But let’s be honest. What educator went in on Feb. 15” — the day after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. — “without facing questions of safety, school shootings, teachers carrying guns, or a number of other concerns from their students? We are doing our children a disservice by not having critical conversations, exploring current events and issues, and building a capacity to make the world better.” Here are edited versions of some of the other responses.

1094,"American stock markets slipped early Thursday after global markets were roiled by the latest twists in the trade war between the United States and China. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average all declined in early trading, following losses in benchmark Asian and European indexes in the overnight session. Foreign investors sold stocks following reports that Trump administration’s proposed to more than double the proposed tariffs it has said it would levy on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. China’s main stock index dropped 2 percent, and in Hong Kong, an index of China’s biggest listed companies, ended down slightly more than that. European stocks followed Asian markets, with indexes in Germany and Britain both edging lower. Hours before, President Trump instructed the United States trade representative to look into increasing tariffs on Chinese imports like fish, handbags and other goods to 25 percent from 10 percent, a significant step in a dispute that is beginning to take a toll on industries and consumers in both countries. “If it had not been for the sideswipe on trade, markets would have been in much better shape this week,” Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities, told Reuters. A final decision on the size and scope of the tariffs is not expected before September, but any tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports would come on top of the existing penalties on $34 billion worth of products and an additional $16 billion that are scheduled to go into effect soon. China has vowed to respond to any trade measures in kind, and it has already imposed its own tariffs on $34 billion worth of American goods. Also weighing on the markets in the region were rising United States bond yields. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note, which rise as prices fall, was near 3 percent, the highest level in weeks. Rising yields could make dollar-backed debt costlier to repay, especially for emerging markets. Investors often rush to the safety of government bonds in times of market turmoil. But a stretch of strong economic data reports in the United States has recently encouraged investors. The Federal Reserve, as it held its benchmark interest rate steady, said Wednesday that economic growth was “solid.” The same may not be as true for China. On Tuesday, Chinese officials called for further government spending to offset a slowdown in China’s economy, which has taken place as the government tries to rein in surging debt. The Chinese currency was little changed on Thursday, but it fell to a 13-month low against the dollar earlier in the week. "
1095,"As the tagline appearing onscreen early in Spike Lee’s latest film exclaims (in capital letters, punctuated with an expletive), “BlacKkKlansman” is “Based on Some Fo’ Real, Fo’ Real” material. But instead of opening with his truth-is-crazier-than-fiction story of a black police officer named Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan in Colorado in the 1970s, Mr. Lee features scenes from films that he has revisited before: D.W. Griffith’s “The Birth of a Nation” and the Oscar-winning “Gone With the Wind.” Mr. Lee’s return to these two cinematic classics is neither happenstance nor hagiographic; he uses them to once again pursue a theme threaded throughout his work, to tell the story of American racial terrorism. The juxtaposition is vintage Lee: a blend of satire, realism and in-your-face political commentary. First, a disconsolate Scarlett O’Hara weaves her way through hundreds of injured Confederate soldiers lying prostrate on the streets of downtown Atlanta. Then, a fictional black-and-white film begins unspooling, with Alec Baldwin playing a pro-segregation narrator named Dr. Kennebrew Beauregard who espouses racist vitriol. As Beauregard fumbles and forget his lines, Mr. Lee projects actual footage from “The Birth of a Nation” onto Baldwin’s face, partially obscuring it into blackness. Mr. Lee is not concerned that audiences may find the conceit too over the top. It’s perfectly in keeping with the times we live in, he emphatically said by phone recently from his 40 Acres and a Mule headquarters in Brooklyn. “We’re living in pure, undiluted insanity,” he said. “Families are being stripped apart, kids put in cages, that’s going back to our ancestors being broken up and sold. That’s the world we live in.” Over a three-decade career of impressive range, matters of race are never from the surface of Mr. Lee’s work, whether the movie is the dazzling and incendiary “Do The Right Thing,” his box-office high “Inside Man,” or the documentaries “The Original Kings of Comedy” and “When The Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts.” And he has regularly grappled with domestic terrorism spawned by racism, an abiding interest that dates to film school. "
1096,"How do you connect what you’re learning in the classroom with what’s going on in the world outside of school? For the Aug. 5 edition of Learning, a quarterly Times print section about education, we rounded up some answers to that question from teachers and students. If you’d like to see what will appear in print, check out “Teachers and Students Speak Out When School Gets Real.” Our student submissions were drawn from the 1,200 responses we received last year when, as one of our many annual student challenges, we asked teenagers to link their lessons to life.

1097,"In late June, after word emerged that the white supremacists who organized last year’s deadly “Unite the Right” march in Charlottesville, Va., had applied to hold an anniversary rally this month in Washington, a local political activist, Brendan Orsinger, saw that a Facebook event page had been created for a counterprotest. He recognized it as trouble. Little did he know just how much. The event page was created on June 24 by a feminist-oriented Facebook political page called Resisters. On June 25, Mr. Orsinger reached out via Facebook to a Resisters administrator he knew as “Mary,” whom he had messaged before, to discuss how Washington-based activists resent it when national activists crowd out local organizers on an event. Mr. Orsinger gently suggested to “Mary” that the Resisters “get buy-in from local DC organizers of color first,” like the local Black Lives Matter chapter, for the counterprotest, according to messages reviewed by The New York Times. “Mary” appeared receptive, he said. So Mr. Orsinger connected several other Washington-based activist groups to help flesh out the event page the Resisters had started. This week, to the shock of Mr. Orsinger and other activists, Facebook deleted the event page, including all their handiwork. On Tuesday, the company suspended the account of “Mary,” apparently deeming it a fake, and said the Resisters page was a tool in a coordinated political influence operation to sow division ahead of the midterm elections. National security officials on Thursday said Russia was still injecting misinformation into American social media every day. Mr. Orsinger’s experience shows how real people continue to become entangled with fake accounts and pages on Facebook — and the sometimes significant consequences for them as the company has tried to clamp down. Mr. Orsinger said he was invited into the Resisters page on Facebook in January and interacted with “Mary” for months on the social network, without thinking anything was amiss. “Mary” was not the only apparently fake Facebook account that drew legitimate activists into the Resisters event page. On July 1, another Resisters administrator, “Natasha Shipley,” reached out to Workers Against Racism, a national group, to request help for the same event — quickly making it a co-host, too, according to messages reviewed by The Times. Facebook has suspended the “Natasha Shipley” account as well, the messages show. "

1099,"LONDON — He may have come and gone here in the twinkling of a faux pas in July, but Donald J. Trump is still casting a very visible shadow over this city’s cultural landscape. American playgoers visiting London’s theaters in search of escapism may find that there’s an awful lot on this city’s stages to remind them of political frictions they only thought they’d left at home. Anxieties about the surge of nationalism on both sides of the Atlantic are percolating through plays as different as “Imperium,” the Royal Shakespeare Company’s absorbing two-part adaptation of Robert Harris’s “Cicero Trilogy” of novels set in ancient Rome; and Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson’s “The Jungle,” an immersive piece that places its audience in the midst of an migrant encampment at Calais. Even the latest comedy by Alan Bennett, “Allelujah!,” set in a geriatric ward, simmers with its author’s dismay about xenophobia in the age of Brexit. So did David Hare’s “The Moderate Soprano” (now closed), about the founding of the Glyndebourne music festival in the 1930s, and the invaluable contributions of German artists in creating what is perceived as a quintessentially English institution. (Mr. Hare’s play has acquired enhanced resonance with newly raised concerns over the impact of Brexit on the British classical music culture.) The National Theater this summer has offered windows on American racism (with a rousing production of Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’s “An Octoroon”) and self-cannibalizing capitalism (the fabulous “Lehman Trilogy”), as well as Britain’s culturally invasive colonialism (in an exquisite revival of the Brian Friel masterwork “Translations.”) Some of these productions are more blatantly topical than others. Consider that bloated guy with the surreal blond coif, for instance, who makes his entrance to knowing chuckles at the John Gielgud Theater these days, where “Imperium” runs through Sept. 8. His name may be Pompey, and he may be a denizen of ancient Rome. But as a walking sight gag, described by another character as “a petulant child in the body of an aging man,” he’s as much an effigy of the sitting American president as the Angry Baby balloon that flew over Parliament Square during Mr. Trump’s brief recent visit. "
1100,"Last week, President Trump lobbed racist insults at LeBron James, he called the press an enemy of the people (again), and Rudy Giuliani gave rambling interviews chock-full of lies and tacit admissions of guilt too tantalizing to ignore. It was a typical Trump week with myriad things to cover. We didn’t hear much about the administration’s secret plan to bypass Congress (and common sense) to give a giant tax break to Wall Street investors, a possible violation of the constitution and a betrayal of the president’s promises to stand up for the little guy. It's the result of what I call the “Trump Trap.” Many people — myself included — have invested enormous amounts of energy protesting Trump, yet we still lack a consistent indictment of him as we enter the midterms. The facts are clear: Donald Trump has repeatedly broken his promises to working people. He pledged to clean up the D.C. swamp, but he made it swampier. He said he would make health insurance better, but he actually asked a judge to strip it away from people with serious diseases like cancer and diabetes. His tax cuts ballooned C.E.O. salaries and stock buybacks, but real wages are still frozen. He has not only failed to make life better for working people but also has made an already precarious economic situation  worse. But you wouldn’t know it from watching the news. That’s because his unnecessary insults and controversies create a constellation of outrages that deflect accountability for his actions. We faced this same problem on the Hillary Clinton campaign. That's when I first experienced the Trump Trap. You probably remember Khizr Khan, the Gold Star father who spoke so eloquently at the Democratic Convention about his son, Humayun, an Army captain, who heroically gave his life in Iraq. "
1101,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Internet limits, California’s largest wildfire and India’s first Ikea. Here’s what you need to know: • Who controls the internet? In China, the government maintains strict censorship. So a generation of teenagers has grown up within limits they seem not to question. Above, Wen Shengjian, 14, likes basketball and wants to become a rapper, but he said the social criticism voiced by American rappers wouldn’t be good for China. The controls have allowed Beijing to build an alternative value system that competes with Western democracy, our Asia tech columnist writes. And the model of a censored internet is being exported to other countries, including Vietnam, Tanzania and Ethiopia. In the U.S., freedom has been the rule. But repeated peddling of false information finally prompted top technology companies to block one far right-wing figure: Alex Jones, the face and voice of the Infowars media site. He and his followers are claiming an assault on free speech — an assertion free-speech scholars dismiss. _____ • The death toll from the Indonesia earthquake has reached 105, and hopes of finding any more survivors are dimming.

1102,"HOLMDEL, N.J. — The first piece of advice that the handler gave about Robby, a retired military working dog with one eye and wheels supporting his back legs, was not to hug him. The drug-sniffing 13-year-old German shepherd, despite his infirmities, was still trained to repel anybody who leaned in too close. “He’s old school,” said Robby’s handler, U.S. Navy Petty Officer Second Class Ashlea Scully. “He can still be aggressive.” On Tuesday, Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, settled for a pat on the head. Later on, Robby joined five other military dogs — four still on active duty — and their handlers at the War Dog Memorial here as Mr. Menendez announced the passage of his legislation creating a “Guardians of America’s Freedom Medal,” the Department of Defense’s first official commendation for military working dogs. On a hot, muggy day, as Mr. Menendez fielded questions about his challenging re-election fight, Robby, Rudy, Laika, Kkrusty, Kira and O.J. stood panting patiently on leashes next to their handlers, as the senator proclaimed them “four-legged heroes.” “These dogs endure multiple tours of duty. Some come back having lost limbs and others give their lives in service to their teams,” Mr. Menendez said. “Yet until now the U.S. military did not recognize the incredible service and sacrifice of working dogs and their handlers.” Several hundred active-duty dogs are currently deployed with handlers in the Middle East, said Ron Aiello, 74, president of the New Jersey-based War Dogs Association and a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served in Vietnam in 1966-67 with Stormy, a German shepherd scout trained to sniff out booby traps.

1103,"WASHINGTON — Wearing shirts that read “Now Showing: Truth” and with accordions in tow, the comedian Rosie O’Donnell and a cast of Broadway actors and musicians bused from New York to Washington on Monday for a musical protest just outside the White House. The performance was part of a series of daily demonstrations that have taken place in front of the White House since President Trump’s meeting in Helsinki, Finland, with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Monday was the 22nd night of the protests, which have been named the Kremlin Annex. The cast members — who hailed from current and past runs of “Wicked,” “The Lion King,” “Hamilton,” “The Phantom of the Opera” and other shows — belted out songs meant to evoke a political edge or offer a tinge of hope for the hundreds of protesters who are disillusioned by Mr. Trump (who was in New Jersey during the performance). With demonstrators often singing along, the five-song set included climactic Broadway tunes such as “Do You Hear the People Sing?” from “Les Misérables” and “Everybody Rejoice/A Brand New Day” from “The Wiz.” Ms. O’Donnell, who has been an adversary of Mr. Trump’s for more than a decade, organized the trip with the Broadway producer James Wesley and his husband, Seth Rudetsky, who is the host of Sirius XM’s “On Broadway” and a fixture of the Broadway scene. “I said to him: I’m off on Monday. Can we get a bunch of Broadway folks to come down and sing something inspirational for these amazing people who’ve shown up here to protest the president and his administration?” Ms. O’Donnell told the crowd before the performance, referring to Mr. Rudetsky.

1104,"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. Emma Howells had just returned from a news conference with the Rev. Al Sharpton. Marian Carrasquero was heading out the next day to shoot a Cynthia Nixon campaign event. And Gabriella Angotti-Jones was preparing for a trip to Northern California for a story on kelp. The three photographers took a minute to catch their breath in the New York Times cafeteria. “For me, doing something different every day is a huge part of why I love photojournalism,” Ms. Howells, 22, said. “You can never predict what’s happening tomorrow.” These may seem like typical assignments for a Times photographer. But these three women, The Times’s summer photography interns, are anything but typical. They’ve traveled to the border to document asylum seekers, scrambled to City Hall and uploaded photos from a Starbucks, all in their first month as interns. And now they’ve all had their photographs featured on the front page of The Times. Every summer, the Times employs interns for departments across the newsroom, from editing to photography, advertising to social media. But these three young photographers stood out for their “striking combination of technical skill, journalistic rigor and elevated visual aesthetic,” said Meaghan Looram, the director of photography for The Times. They approached photography “with a sophisticated and confident sense of their own aesthetic voice,” she added, “a quality which is unusual to see in photographers at such an early stage in their careers.” The interns have had anywhere from two assignments a day in and around New York City to longer-term projects that take them further afield. They've met every week with mentors to review work and receive feedback. The photographers all come from a variety of backgrounds with different aesthetics, but each was encouraged to trust her own eye — and, more important, her gut. "
1105,"Nine years ago, a Guatemalan woman named Irene said, she watched as gangs murdered her husband in front of her when he refused to pay them a “tax,” or extortion fee, to keep the family musical-instruments business open. Some of the assailants were imprisoned, and she continued to run the shop on her own. Recently, though, the menace resumed, she said. The perpetrators, fresh out of prison, threatened to kill Irene if she did not pay. Fearing for her life, she fled to the United States with her 17-year-old daughter. They arrived at the southwest border seeking asylum on June 13. Under the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance border enforcement policy, the 47-year-old woman was detained and her daughter was sent to a shelter. A few weeks later, Irene had her initial interview with an asylum officer, the first hurdle applicants must clear in the asylum process. The officer, who conducted the interview over the phone, determined that Irene had not proved a “credible fear” of persecution if she returned home. Irene was dumbstruck. What was their definition of fear? “I can’t go back to my country,” Irene, who asked that only her first name be used because she feared reprisals, said this week in a phone interview. “They’ll kill me if I go back.” Immigration attorneys and advocates report that asylum applicants in recent months are failing their crucial initial screenings with asylum officers at the border in record numbers, the first sign that the Trump administration is carrying out promises to reduce the number of people granted asylum in the United States and limit the conditions under which it is granted. "
1106,"Not long after several of the country’s biggest tech firms — namely Apple, Facebook and Google — kicked the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones off their various online platforms, Mr. Jones’s allies complained that he had been deprived of his First Amendment rights to free speech. “Social media goes Gestapo!” wrote Bill Mitchell, a conservative Twitter personality with 366,000 followers, on Monday evening. “The great censorship purge has truly begun,” warned Paul Joseph Watson, a contributor to Mr. Jones’s website, Infowars. And in his own message on Twitter, one platform that hasn’t removed his content, Mr. Jones asked: “Now, who will stand against Tyranny and who will stand for free speech?” The removal of Mr. Jones and Infowars came after months of mounting pressure on technology companies to tackle the spread of misinformation online. Mr. Jones and Infowars have for years used social media to push unfounded conspiracy theories. On Sunday, Apple removed five of the six Infowars podcasts on its popular Podcasts app and by Monday Facebook and Google’s YouTube had followed with similar measures. But this isn’t the only effort to stop Mr. Jones from spreading his theories. He also faces multiple defamation claims, and well before Monday’s moves, several scholars of free speech had already concluded that many of the things he has said online were not in fact protected by the First Amendment. "
1107,"ALEXANDRIA, Va. — The trial of Paul Manafort turned into a referendum on the character of two of President Trump’s top campaign aides on Tuesday, as prosecutors cast Mr. Manafort as the architect of a sprawling swindle and defense lawyers portrayed the prosecution’s star witness as a thief, adulterer and liar. The testimony managed to further sully the reputations of both Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman for three months in mid-2016, and the witness, Rick Gates, who was the deputy campaign chairman and later the executive director of Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee. Mr. Manafort personally directed the creation of false financial statements to obtain bank loans and deliberately hid income in foreign bank accounts to evade federal taxes, Mr. Gates testified. When one estimate of his tax bill came out too high, Mr. Manafort fired off a furious email to Mr. Gates. “How could I be blindsided like this? You told me you were on top of this. We need to discuss options. This is a disaster,” he wrote in one of dozens of documents prosecutors have submitted as evidence. Mr. Gates, who is critical to the government’s case against Mr. Manafort, came under cross-examination for the first time, offering a chance to assess how he held up under attacks on his credibility. Mr. Gates’s recounting of Mr. Manafort’s various schemes was almost undone by his description of his own misdoings, including a secret paramour he met for trysts in London. He admitted that he had engaged in so many acts of fraud that he faced up to 100 years in prison if convicted. "
1108,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is advancing a plan to punish legal immigrants for accepting food stamps, public housing and other government benefits they are entitled to — a strategy that appeals to conservatives and could help to galvanize Republican voters before the midterm elections. The proposed rule first surfaced last year. Last month, the White House Office of Management and Budget published a notice that it was under consideration. A Trump administration official said Tuesday that details of the proposal were still weeks away from being finalized and made public. But already, the rule could serve as a talking point for Republican candidates seeking to counter an expected wave of Democratic enthusiasm, seizing on President Trump’s claims that immigrants are an outsize drain on American taxpayers. As drafted, the rule would authorize federal officials to revoke legal resident status from legal immigrants who accept government assistance currently available to them. It essentially concludes that those immigrants are more likely to become “public charges” — dependent on programs like Medicaid, children’s nutrition aid and even housing and transit subsidies. Many of Mr. Trump’s supporters — voters who will be key to victories by Republicans in close contests this fall — believe that legal immigration has cost them jobs, depressed wages and forced higher taxes. "
1109,"ROME — I’ve found lately that I can ruin any dinner party. It’s like magic. Just get me going on Trump or Putin or climate change and I can put a frown on every face and a furrow in every brow. I do weddings and bar mitzvahs, too. So I thought I’d come to Italy for a little sun and risotto. I made the mistake, though, of spending a few days with Italian government and international experts trying to understand the refugee crisis that is fracturing the European Union, much of which originates in Italy. And guess what? Now I can ruin your dinner party — and breakfast! Because what you find when you take a close look at the situation here is something profoundly worrying. I was born in 1953 and have been living my entire life inside the community of democracies that came to be known as “the West” and eventually spread to include democracies around the world, such as Japan, Brazil, South Korea and India. At the core of this community were two pillars: the U.S. and the group of European democracies that became the European Union. “The West” was not just a state of mind. It was an association of countries with shared interests, institutions and values — particularly the values of liberty, democracy, free markets and the rule of law — which made the post-World War II world, though far from perfect, a steadily more prosperous, free and decent place for more and more people. This community of democracies was also a beacon, a refuge and a magnet for those who wanted to embrace its values but were denied them where they lived. But the European pillar of this community of democracies has never been more under assault — so much so that for the first time I wonder if this European pillar will actually crumble. From Italy you can see all the lines of attack: Donald Trump coming from the West, Vladimir Putin from the East and environmental and political disorder from the south — from Africa and the Middle East, where the reckless 2011 French-British-U.S. decision to topple Libyan strongman Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, and not stay on to help build a new order in his place, now haunts Italy. "
1110,"• Get full results from Ohio’s special election here. • Gretchen Whitmer won the Democratic nomination for governor of Michigan, joining women in Georgia, Texas, South Dakota and elsewhere who are competing in November to lead their states. • In Missouri, voters rejected a legislative move to curb union power. • Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, was in a tight race against Gov. Jeff Colyer for the Republican nomination in the governor’s race. President Trump endorsed Mr. Kobach despite some Republican misgivings. • Here are five key takeaways from the results. WESTERVILLE, Ohio — Republicans spent millions of dollars on scorching television ads, pried a reluctant endorsement from Ohio’s moderate governor, used the Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi as a foil and enlisted President Trump in a last-minute turnaround effort in a special election for Congress in Ohio. And after all that, in a conservative-leaning district outside Columbus, the Republican candidate clung to the narrowest of leads on Tuesday night. The Republican, Troy Balderson, a state senator who ran a plodding campaign, led his Democratic challenger, Danny O’Connor, by nearly 1 percentage point with all precincts reporting. But 3,435 provisional ballots have yet to be counted, with Mr. Balderson’s margin standing at 1,754. Ohio law provides for an automatic recount if the two candidates are ultimately separated by less than half a percentage point. National Republicans declared victory before midnight, but it could be days or weeks before there is a conclusive result in the race. And regardless of the outcome, Mr. Balderson and Mr. O’Connor will face each other again in three months, in the regularly scheduled November election. "
1111,"DETROIT — Gretchen Whitmer, a former leader in the Michigan State Senate, captured the Democratic nomination for governor Tuesday night and will face off against the state’s Republican attorney general, Bill Schuette, in a race that looms as a pivotal test of whether Democrats can reclaim power in a state President Trump won two years ago. In the race for the Republican nomination for Senate, John James, a businessman and combat veteran, defeated Sandy Pensler, a financial executive, after benefiting from Mr. Trump’s full-throated support late in the contest. Their victories, reported by The Associated Press, set up deep ideological clashes in the state’s most prominent general election races in November. In the contests for both the governor’s office and the Senate, some of the state’s most Trump-like conservatives will square off against two traditional Democrats — and two women — in Ms. Whitmer and the incumbent senator, Debbie Stabenow. In a sign of Mr. Trump’s looming presence in the midterms, both winners alluded to the president in their acceptance speeches. “It’s time to start winning again,” said Mr. Schuette, echoing a favorite theme of Mr. Trump’s. “I will not be Governor managing Michigan’s decline into a smaller, less significant state. No, I’ll be a jobs Governor.” He easily prevailed over his closest challenger, Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, whose endorsement by the Republican governor, Rick Snyder, was overshadowed by Mr. Trump’s backing for Mr. Schuette. Ms. Whitmer, who defeated several insurgent candidates on the left, also invoked the president in her address to a raucous crowd in a ballroom at Detroit’s Motor City Casino. “Michigan was the place that people used to move to from all around the world,” she said, adding that at a time when some people want to build walls, “we in Michigan are going to get back to building bridges.” "
1112,"After a succession of political setbacks in onetime strongholds and a landmark defeat in the Supreme Court, organized labor has notched a hard-won victory as Missouri voters overrode a legislative move to curb union power. A measure on the ballot on Tuesday asked voters to pass judgment on a prospective law barring private-sector unions from collecting mandatory fees from workers who choose not to become members. The law was rejected by a 2-to-1 margin. The Supreme Court in June struck down such fees for public-sector employees, achieving a longstanding goal of conservative groups and overruling a four-decade precedent. Labor leaders argued that the rare opportunity for voters to weigh in directly on a so-called right-to-work measure — which several states have passed in recent years — revealed how little public support the policy has, at least once voters get beyond the anodyne branding. “It shows how out of touch those institutions are,” said Richard Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. “How out of touch the Republican legislature in Missouri is, how out of touch the Supreme Court is.” But Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist who studies unions at Washington University in St. Louis, cautioned against overstating the victory. A mere 8.7 percent of workers in Missouri were union members last year, below the national average and down from more than 13 percent a decade-and-a-half ago. "
1113,"Beachgoers in Alabama who descended on the breeding ground of a threatened seabird species this summer scared adults away from their nests and used the eggs to decorate the sand, most likely killing hundreds of chicks, wildlife experts say. The exact number of least tern birds that died in Mobile Bay is unknown, but it was “a tragic loss of a colony that size,” said Katie Barnes, a senior biologist at Birmingham Audubon who oversees the protection, monitoring and surveying of Alabama’s coastal bird species. Least terns, which are protected by the federal government under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, often lay their eggs on wide-open beachfronts, digging shallow nests beneath the sandy surface. The diminutive birds — adults weigh just 1.5 ounces — are considered a threatened species for several reasons, including beach recreation, Ms. Barnes said. “They’re very sacred to us because they are so sensitive,” she said. Although the least tern population in Alabama is not endangered, as populations in other locations are, the birds there have still struggled with habitat loss and sea level rise. “The population was doing so poorly elsewhere, this was basically one last shot for a large number of adults,” Ms. Barnes said.

1114," Why do fictional television shows often do better than factual journalism at giving viewers a truer sense of the world in all its complexity? Here’s a big reason: TV script writers understand that viewers can deal with nuance and contradictions. Good TV, whether cable or broadcast, shows us fully rounded people grappling with challenges that viewers can identify with on some level, invented and over the top though they may be. They can be larger than life, like the mafia-don-in-therapy Tony Soprano, or more ordinary people like Coach and Mrs. Coach, doing the hard work of marriage on the Texas high-school football drama “Friday Night Lights” or Gretchen Cutler, a narcissistic sociopath on the road to maturity on “You’re the Worst.” These characters don’t always have the answers. They believe and do contradictory things. Stuff doesn’t always work out. You know, reality. Viewers don’t just tolerate complexity — they demand it. The one-dimensional characters of early network television dramas would seem boring and fake today. Journalists, however, too often seem to believe that audiences can’t handle complexity. There are exceptions, but a vast majority of journalism actively avoids it. Or we quote both sides and think that’s complexity. Like television writers, we are searching for a compelling story, but we tend to find it in the clash of the shrillest sound bites rather than in the fine distinctions that transmit important truths. If we have details or quotes that don’t fit the narrative, we often strip them out. It’s not fake news. It is all based on facts. But much too often it presents the most cartoonish and reductive picture of a very intricate world. "
1115,"The Trump administration’s new tariffs on imported metals are rattling the construction industry and sending ripples of anxiety through related concerns, including the city’s housing market. New fees imposed this spring on imported steel and aluminum are making it more expensive to produce the kinds of walls and windows that are found in apartment buildings, according to people who work in the development business. Because builders buy materials well before any ground is broken — and months, if not years, ahead of the opening of sales and rental offices — the effect of tariffs on apartment prices and rents may take a while to filter through the system. But if the import fees remain in place, buyers and renters will inevitably feel a pinch, said suppliers, contractors, construction trade groups, developers and brokers. “It’s still a little early yet,” said Steven Rutter, the director of Stribling Marketing Associates, which has development projects in various stages, “but I think these tariffs could have ripple effects all down the line.” Thus far, hard data about the effect of steel and aluminum tariffs on New York’s development business are relatively scarce. And many developers seem loath to discuss the subject, perhaps unwilling to spook a market already showing signs of weakness, or hoping to avoid a charged political atmosphere. The new tariffs — 25 percent on foreign steel and 10 percent on foreign aluminum — are intended to level the playing field for international trade by encouraging companies to buy domestic rather than imported products, but some builders believe that American suppliers can’t currently meet every demand. "
1116,"Throughout President Trump’s term, it has sometimes seemed as if the world chronicled in the tabloids has invaded the corridors of power in Washington. Mr. Trump’s alleged affairs with a pornographic film star and a former Playboy bunny have become national news, joined by figures from publications typically more associated with supermarket checkout lines than the White House briefing room. This week, Kristin M. Davis, a former high-class procuress from New York, is set to become a witness for the federal prosecutors who are looking into ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign. If you have been wondering about how Ms. Davis found herself enmeshed in the Russia investigation, here are a few answers to some questions you may have. A former finance worker and a twice-failed candidate for elected office, Ms. Davis, 43, is perhaps best known as the “Manhattan Madam” — a name used to describe her by The New York Post and The Daily News, for whom she offered tantalizing grist at the height of her fame in the early 2000s. After serving in the back office at a hedge fund, Ms. Davis tried her hand at a more lucrative venture: running an escort service that she called “Wicked Models.” In the years she ran her business, she and the city’s gossip pages claimed, without much in the way of corroborating evidence, that she had furnished prostitutes to a list of famous men, including Eliot Spitzer, the former New York governor who resigned his post after The New York Times reported that he was a patron of a different escort service. In 2008, Ms. Davis was charged with money laundering and promoting prostitution and spent four months in jail on Rikers Island. Two years after finishing her sentence, Ms. Davis, a self-described Libertarian, ran for New York governor as a protest candidate on a platform touting the legalization of pot and prostitution. She was advised in her campaign by Roger J. Stone Jr., a veteran Republican strategist whom she had known for years. In 2013, Ms. Davis ran for a different office — New York City comptroller — challenging, of all opponents, Mr. Spitzer. She withdrew from the race a month before the election after she was arrested for a second time on federal charges of illegally selling prescription drugs like Adderall and Xanax. Prosecutors have not said what information they think Ms. Davis can provide about ties between Russia and Mr. Trump’s presidential bid, but one obvious nexus between Ms. Davis and the president is Mr. Stone, who served them both as a political strategist over the years. "
1117,"Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles drafted a criminal complaint against a former Goldman Sachs banker early this year for his alleged role in a vast Malaysian fraud, but the charges were never filed because of a Justice Department turf battle, according to two people familiar with the investigation. Now, these people and two others say, the inquiry is solely in the hands of federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, who are investigating a target much bigger than a single Wall Street banker: Goldman Sachs itself. The investigation centers on the disappearance of about $4 billion from a giant Malaysian government investment fund known formally as 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. Prosecutors in the United States and elsewhere believe that a group of people with close ties to the former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak stole from the fund to buy paintings, yachts, real estate and even investment stakes in movies like “The Wolf of Wall Street.” Goldman provided an array of services to the fund, including helping it sell billions of dollars in bonds to investors. The bank earned about $600 million in fees for its work. Authorities are examining whether the firm played a role in the 1MDB fraud or should have done more to uncover the misappropriation of funds, the four people said. Goldman has repeatedly played down its role in the 1MDB scandal, saying it was unaware of how money from the fund was being used. The firm has said it was cooperating with the investigation. “Goldman Sachs had no visibility into whether some of the funds we helped raise for 1MDB may have been subsequently diverted to other purposes,” said Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman. "
1118,"WASHINGTON — In President Trump’s mind, he has become the indispensable man, the political force singularly responsible for the narrow lead that Troy Balderson, the Republican candidate, clings to in a heavily conservative Ohio House district and that Kris W. Kobach maintains in the Kansas governor’s primary. But the presidential braggadocio that followed Tuesday’s election night squeakers ignores another reality that the White House is loath to acknowledge: Mr. Trump — and his chaotic, controversy-laden tenure in the Oval Office — is largely responsible for the toxic political climate that is undermining the Republican candidates he is trying to save. Economic growth topped 4 percent earlier this year. Unemployment is low; stock prices are high. Yet Republicans speak darkly of the awful environment their candidates face in midterm elections 90 days away. “Trump injects a certain level of uncertainty and chaos into these races,” said Kevin Madden, a veteran Republican strategist who was a top adviser to Mitt Romney, the party’s 2012 presidential nominee. “There is no doubt that Trump is actually increasing Democrat turnout.” The president appears to exist in a sunny political environment all his own. In a late-night tweet on Tuesday, Mr. Trump bragged about “a big turn for the better” in Mr. Balderson’s campaign after the president held a boisterous get-out-the-vote rally in Ohio on Saturday night. On Wednesday morning, he crowed that Republicans went “5 for 5” in races on Tuesday and predicted that whenever he campaigns for candidates, “they will win!” “As long as I campaign and/or support Senate and House candidates (within reason), they will win! I LOVE the people, & they certainly seem to like the job I’m doing. If I find the time, in between China, Iran, the Economy and much more, which I must, we will have a giant Red Wave!” he boasted Wednesday on Twitter. "
1119,"BEIJING — The United States and China have sparred repeatedly over trade, in a tit-for-tat skirmish that has shown little sign of abating. High-level talks have stalled, while both sides have been threatening further tariffs in recent days. But beneath the acrimony, two potential paths for China seem to be emerging, according to participants in the trade negotiations and their advisers. Both would deliver trade wins for President Trump and his more moderate advisers, while also letting President Xi Jinping of China push ahead with his ambitious industrial plan to build national champions in cutting-edge technologies. A stalemate appears the most likely endgame, with new American and Chinese tariffs staying in place for months or even years. So far, the United States has imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese technology goods and $3 billion of Chinese steel and aluminum, with another $16 billion in the offing. China has responded in kind, outlining its own plan on Wednesday for measures on $16 billion of American goods. While the policies have drawn loud complaints from American companies that have become reliant on imports from China, they have been forcing multinationals to rethink their supply chains and start moving them away from China. Over time, such changes could reduce the trade deficit between the two countries and limit national security concerns, two big sources of discontent for Mr. Trump. A negotiated truce is also possible. Although the two sides remain far apart, Beijing has made subtle shifts to a more conciliatory position. China now appears willing to discuss changes to its strategic plan, Made in China 2025, which the Trump administration has identified as a long-term threat to big American industries like aircraft manufacturing, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. China’s stance now is that a resolution of trade tensions must not block its further economic progress, but adjustments to Made in China 2025 could happen. The latest trade figures, which came out Wednesday, show that Chinese exports continue to surge, giving Beijing some confidence. “The red line is China’s right to develop, not the concrete industrial policies and measures regarding Made in China 2025,” said He Weiwen, a former Commerce Ministry official who remains one of China’s top trade experts.

1121,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The good news, if you’re a Republican: Troy Balderson is narrowly ahead in a special election to fill a House seat in a district outside Columbus, Ohio. The bad news: It’s a district that President Trump won handily in 2016 and that routinely elected Republicans before that. With provisional ballots yet to be counted, it could be days or weeks before there’s a final result in the election, one of many on Tuesday. Here are five takeaways and full results from five states. • Among the highlights: A Republican primary for governor is deadlocked in Kansas; Republican candidates endorsed by Mr. Trump won in Michigan; and voters in Missouri rejected a proposal to curb union power.

1122,"When they talk about President Trump, why are so many Democratic politicians talking about treason? Whatever they may truly believe, why are they letting their inflammatory rhetoric become decoupled from the facts? By doing so, they are setting the country on a dangerous, unpredictable trajectory that could lead to a crisis of political legitimacy. And by indulging their own worst instincts, these Democrats are guilty of fomenting the extreme, intemperate rhetoric for which they have consistently criticized the president. If it were only activists or internet trolls claiming that Mr. Trump committed treason, it could, perhaps, be excused as excessive passion or immaturity. But these comments are also coming from elected Democrats with increasing regularity. Last week, Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, tweeted at the president, “Let’s be 1,000% clear: if you worked with a hostile foreign power during your election, it’s called TREASON.” The caps are in the original. Nor is it just Senator Merkley. Other prominent Democrats, including Steny Hoyer, the House minority whip, have done it, too. Mr. Hoyer said that he agreed with John Brennan, a former C.I.A. director, that Mr. Trump’s meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Helsinki, Finland, last month was “nothing short of treasonous.” Representative Adam Smith of Washington State, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said that it was “hard to see” Mr. Trump’s actions as “anything other than treason.” The list keeps growing. This is destructive of the very institutions that these politicians claim to defend because they are seeking not merely to oppose Mr. Trump and his presidency, but to delegitimize his election. It’s true that the president himself stridently criticizes his opponents. Like it or not, that’s politics. But attacking the legitimacy of an election undermines the efficacy of the regime itself in a way that the president’s accusations never have. Perhaps such rhetoric arises from a sense of political impotence. After all, Republicans control the White House and both houses of Congress. Or perhaps Mr. Merkley, Mr. Hoyer, Mr. Smith and the others believe it. Maybe they think that Robert Mueller, the special counsel, will one day uncover the smoking gun that has become an article of faith among Trump haters. What that would look like is anyone’s guess. In this fraught political climate, smoking guns are probably in the eye of the beholder. "
1123,"CHICAGO — Sixty-six people were shot in Chicago from early Friday evening to early Monday morning, 12 of them fatally. It’s a high number that marks a low point of the year for the city. This past weekend’s youngest shooting victim was only 11 years old. Violence on such a scale is always tragic. And unfortunately in America, particularly when it comes to Chicago, there is always a tragically narrow and predictable reaction: blaming the scourge on a lack of support for the police and the political cowardice of urban Democrats. Since the shootings, President Trump’s personal lawyer and the former New York City mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, has taken to Twitter and continued that pattern, using the carnage as an opportunity to denounce Mayor Rahm Emanuel and bolster his election opponent, former police superintendent Garry McCarthy, who was fired amid the fallout from the fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald, a black 17-year-old. “Give Garry McCarthy your support @Garry4Chicago. Tomorrow I will get you information to contribute. MAKE CHICAGO SAFE AGAIN! He can do a lot better than Mayor Emmanuel who is fiddling while Chicago burns,” he tweeted, along with a flurry of similar posts. "
1124,"Fame, David Bowie once sang, is bully for you, chilly for me. By which I’m pretty sure he was suggesting that celebrity, at least for him, had been at best a mixed blessing. Barack Obama, appearing on Jerry Seinfeld’s show “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee” a couple of years ago, seemed to regret being one of the world’s most famous people. In particular, the president lamented, he missed the ability to just walk down the street talking with a friend unnoticed. “With all due respect,” Mr. Seinfeld countered, “I remember very well not being famous. It wasn’t that great.” Compared with these great men, my own fame is a humble, diminutive thing. But I still wonder sometimes whether, in the great scheme of things, my experience of celebrity has been bully, or chilly. On a rainy, windswept day last spring, my friend Timothy Kreider and I paid a visit to the Hall of Fame for Great Americans, the colonnade of busts of writers, statesmen and inventors that stands upon one of the highest spots in New York City. In its heyday, back in 1900, inclusion here was what it meant to be famous in America. When the Munchkins sing to Dorothy, “You’ll be a bust, be a bust, be a bust, in the Hall of Fame!” in “The Wizard of Oz,” this is what they meant. But this Hall of Fame is no longer famous. Largely forgotten now even by New Yorkers, it looks more than a little careworn. These days, the Hall of Fame is best known for kicking two of its inductees out: Last summer, Governor Andrew Cuomo ordered the busts of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson removed. As it turns out, leading an insurrection to preserve the option of enslaving other people isn’t the best long-term strategy for veneration. "

1126,"Good Wednesday. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Shares in the embattled electric carmaker jumped yesterday after the FT reported that Saudi Arabia had bought a stake. Then Elon Musk dropped a bombshell on Twitter: He was considering taking the business private at $420 a share, and funding was “secured.” That would be the biggest ever leveraged buyout, and at a 20 percent premium on where Tesla’s trading. The audacity of the plan dumbfounded traders and reporters — as did the casual way Mr. Musk announced it. It makes sense for him. Investors have battered Tesla for missing production targets and failing to turn a profit in the eight years since it went public. One precedent Mr. Musk endorsed was Michael Dell, who revived his computer company after taking it private. Huge questions remain, though. Does Mr. Musk really have that financing? (CNBC couldn’t find any banks aware of it.) How could Tesla afford the debt payments without free cash flow? Was Mr. Musk just trying to squeeze short sellers? And did his tweet violate securities rules? Andrew has a question, too: What happens to Tesla if this doesn’t work out? The circus won’t have pleased big investors. Critics’ corner: The analyst Gene Munster thinks going private could solve Tesla’s problems. Charley Grant of Heard on the Street says it might not even be a real option. And Lex thinks Mr. Musk might tussle with private investors, too. "
1127,"The New York Times continued its digital growth in the second quarter of 2018, adding 109,000 digital-only subscribers. With that rise came an increase in revenue that counteracted a decline in print advertising. The company said on Wednesday that revenue from digital subscriptions rose to $99 million in the second quarter, a jump of nearly 20 percent compared with the same period a year ago. Over all for the second quarter, total revenue increased 2 percent, to $415 million, and the company reported a profit of almost $24 million. The Times now has 2.9 million digital-only subscribers, out of 3.8 million total. “Subscription revenues accounted for nearly two-thirds of the company’s revenues, a trend we expect to continue,” Mark Thompson, the company’s chief executive, said in a news release. “We continue to believe that there is significant runway to expand that base substantially.” Shares of The New York Times Company fell on Wednesday, closing 6.6 percent lower. Other company revenue grew 40 percent in the second quarter, largely as a result of the company’s agreement with Newsday to print and transport its publications. Other sources of revenue included the renting of an additional four floors in the New York headquarters and the success of Wirecutter, a review and recommendation website bought by The Times in 2016. Even with the rise in digital subscriptions, the company had a 10 percent decline in advertising revenue, with digital advertising revenue falling 7.5 percent, to $51 million. Print advertising revenue decreased in the second quarter of the year by 11.5 percent, to $68 million. The second quarter of 2017, during which digital advertising experienced a 23 percent increase, was an outlier, thanks in part to the so-called Trump Bump. "
1128,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) As California firefighters battle historic wildfires across the state, our readers have reached out with questions about the role climate change plays in the intensity and frequency of these blazes. Others have expressed confusion over tweets by President Trump laying the blame on the state’s forestry and water management policies. The New York Times reporter Lisa Friedman, who covers climate and wrote about this topic, dug into her reporter’s notebook to answer some of your top questions: What exactly is the role of climate change in these intensifying wildfire seasons? Is it all climate change, or are there other factors as well? Lisa: I put that question to Michael F. Wehner, a senior staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He stressed that there is no question that warming temperatures have led to severe droughts, meaning more dry fuel, as well as more intense heat waves. Those are essentially the conditions that have made for wildfire seasons that start earlier, last longer and affect larger areas. “To dismiss the role of climate change on these fires is simply incorrect,” said Mr. Wehner, who was a lead author on a chapter of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, a series of federal summaries of climate change data. He made the point, as most climate scientists do, that the cause of the wildfires is multifold, like in any complex event. And this trend promises to continue: According to the National Climate Assessment science report released last year, the number of large forest fires in the Western United States and Alaska is projected to rise as the climate continues to warm. "
1129,"Alarmed by the tight race for a congressional seat in Ohio, Republicans are steeling for a 90-day campaign of trench warfare as they fight to keep control of the House, pinning their hopes on well-funded outside groups and a slashing negative message about Democrats. Voting across the Midwest and West laid bare the party’s precarious situation on Wednesday: Ohio’s special election exposed deep vulnerabilities in the historically conservative suburbs of Columbus, and the Republican candidate there held a slim lead over his Democratic challenger. In Kansas, a nomination fight for governor also remained too close to call the day after the primary, with a hard-right candidate threatening to topple the state’s Republican incumbent and splinter the party down ballot. And in primaries from suburban Detroit to Seattle, Democrats selected hard-charging candidates in districts long held by the Republican Party. Republicans say they can keep a thin grip on the House by propping up incumbent lawmakers in red-tinged districts and branding the Democrats as wildly left-wing. But senior party strategists have concluded that over a dozen districts held by Republicans may already be unwinnable, most in metropolitan areas where President Trump has alienated moderates and stirred volcanic resistance on the left. “Every white, suburban district in the country will be a swing district in November, that’s the takeaway” from the Ohio election, said Representative Carlos Curbelo, a Florida Republican who is being targeted by Democrats. "
1130,"DETROIT — By the time Rashida Tlaib was finished, not a dry eye remained in the room. “I want people across the country to know that you don’t need to sell out,” Ms. Tlaib said early Wednesday morning. “You don’t have to change who you are to run for office — and that is what this country is about.” Ms. Tlaib is poised to become the first Muslim woman ever elected to Congress, after she narrowly defeated Brenda Jones, Detroit’s City Council president, in a Democratic primary race to succeed longtime Representative John Conyers Jr. in Michigan’s 13th Congressional District. She will run unopposed in November. In a separate Democratic primary contest for a special election to serve the remaining months of Mr. Conyers’s term, Ms. Jones prevailed over Ms. Tlaib on Wednesday afternoon, according to The Associated Press. Ms. Tlaib, a former Michigan state legislator, Detroit native and daughter of Palestinian immigrants, was so cautious about celebrating her victory that she waited until every vote was counted — and long after The Associated Press had called the race in her favor — to begin her celebrations at almost 3 a.m. That meant the crowd had thinned significantly from the dozens who attended her earlier results watch party, but those who stayed until the early morning saw a special sight: a room of largely Arab-American immigrants emotionally celebrating an American democracy that has, in their view, been hostile to their existence and identity. “A lot of my strength comes from being Palestinian,” she said at one point. Ms. Tlaib’s mother draped her in the Palestinian flag as she spoke. "
1131,"Representative Chris Collins was at the Congressional Picnic on the South Lawn of the White House last summer when he received an unexpected email from the head of a drug company in which he was heavily invested. The company’s only product — an experimental treatment for multiple sclerosis — had just failed a do-or-die scientific trial. What Mr. Collins did next, apparently in a state of panic, forms the core of a federal indictment unsealed on Wednesday in New York that accuses him of insider trading and lying to federal agents. Federal prosecutors charged Mr. Collins with brazenly using his private information about the company to help his son and others avoid financial disaster. The charges against Mr. Collins, a New York Republican who was one of President Trump’s earliest and most ardent supporters, stem from his involvement with Innate Immunotherapeutics Limited, a small drug maker based in Australia, which had no approved drugs but several well-placed allies in the capital. Within minutes of learning about the company’s unsuccessful test, Mr. Collins frantically called his son, Cameron Collins, who, in the days that followed, sold off his stock, avoiding losses of more than $570,000, prosecutors said. Brought to court by the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, the indictment cast what could be a long shadow in the House. At least five Republican lawmakers were shareholders in Innate Immunotherapeutics at the time of the Collins family’s sell-off, according to financial disclosures. Mr. Collins’s case has also raised ethical questions about the propriety of a member of Congress, sitting on the House committee with jurisdiction over health care companies, being not only the largest shareholder of an Australian drug maker, but also a member of its board, good-government advocates said. "
1132,"WASHINGTON — American immigration officials arrested 2,885 fewer people at the Southwest border last month than in June, the second month in a row that the number of migrants trying to enter the United States has dropped. Data released on Wednesday by the Department of Homeland Security show that authorities apprehended 39,953 people at the American border with Mexico in July. The number of arrests in June totaled 42,838. A senior Homeland Security official attributed the decrease in apprehensions in part to the Trump administration’s stepped up immigration policies at the border. But the official agreed with advocates and experts that the numbers also reflect seasonal flows of border crossings; individuals are more likely to travel in milder weather than during the often dangerous heat of summer. An estimated 4,357 unaccompanied children showed up at the border in July, the data show, compared to 5,562 in a month earlier. Meanwhile, 12,285 people traveling in family groups were denied entry to the United States last month, compared to 12,386 family members in June. The two consecutive months of fewer migrants followed a flood of people in the spring who illegally crossed the Southwest border and into the United States. More than 50,000 migrants were arrested after entering the country from Mexico each month from March to May. But in 2017, illegal border crossings dropped to a more than 40-year low, a decrease largely attributed to Mr. Trump’s election. The springtime rise in people attempting to enter the United States was a source of frustration for the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration. Tony Payan, director of the Mexico Center at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, said he expects the number of migrants to rise as weather conditions improve. “These are people fleeing harsh economic conditions and violence,” Mr. Payan said. “They are going to keep coming no matter what the enforcement policies are at the border.” In April, the Trump administration announced a so-called zero-tolerance policy to prosecute all immigrants who illegally entered the United States. But by early July, facing an international outcry, officials backed off the policy, after it resulted in detaining thousands of adults and separating them from their children. By the end of the month, the federal government had reunited more than 1,800 migrant families who had been separated. But about 711 children were not reunited with parents who were, for various reasons, deemed ineligible. That figure included more than 460 adults, most of whom are believed to have been deported without their children. The number of people arrested at the Southwest border remains well below historic highs seen in the 1990s and early 2000s, when more than 1 million sought to enter the United States from Mexico each year. Since 2007, the number of illegal border crossings has continued to drop, and has remained under 500,000 people annually since 2010. "
1133,"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. Wednesday marks another day of court in the financial fraud trial of Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman — and another day when reporters will swarm the square in front of the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Va. As news assistants in The New York Times’s Washington bureau, Emily Baumgaertner and I have developed a sort of mini-guidebook to help Sharon LaFraniere, the investigative reporter leading our trial coverage, juggle the technology restrictions of the courtroom with the demands of the daily news cycle outside its walls. Here are some of our helpful hints for navigating the sidelines of the first trial in the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation. Before you go: The Albert V. Bryan United States Courthouse doesn’t allow personal technology into its midst — and, unlike other courthouses, doesn’t offer lockers in which to store forbidden devices. For that reason, your first stop will be the cafe next door to the courthouse. For about $6 — unless you’ve got more than a phone and a laptop, you won’t make the credit card minimum — the owners will rubberband your technology together, number it and hold it underneath the counter. In return, you’ll get a small slip of paper the size of your pinkie, with a number handwritten on it in marker. (Even the security guards will point you toward this cafe if they spot an errant smartphone or Apple watch.) "
1134,"In recent decades, conservative activists and lawmakers have turned labor unions into convenient punching bags. In Missouri on Tuesday, however, unions seemed to figure out at least one way to punch back: Voters there resoundingly defeated an anti-union law via ballot proposal. There’s always a danger in over-interpreting the results of a single election, but the two-to-one margin by which Missouri voters overturned the so-called right-to-work law appears to be the latest sign of resurgent and effective labor activism. The vote comes months after teacher strikes around the country forced Republican-controlled legislatures in states like West Virginia and Oklahoma to hand out big raises to overworked and underpaid workers for the first time in many years. The Missouri law, which passed in early 2017 but never went into effect, was designed to weaken private-sector unions. It would have allowed workers to claim the benefits of union-negotiated contracts and representation in disputes with management without having to pay dues and fees to cover the cost of those benefits. Missouri is hardly a bastion of liberalism — President Trump won it by nearly 20 points in 2016. But voters there, as in much of the country, seem to be waking up to the concerted, yearslong conservative campaigns to exacerbate income inequality and impoverish working-class families. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. noted that Tuesday was the first time a right-to-work law had been overturned through a ballot measure. With that success, expect unions to use this tactic again in the near future. Right-to-work laws, which are now in place in 27 states, have been branded as such because Republicans have successfully framed this issue as one of giving workers the right to not belong to a union. Backers of these laws also argue that they help states attract businesses and create jobs. In practice, the measures undercut labor power and have done little to create good-paying jobs. They have contributed to the steady, decades-long decline in union membership — less than 11 percent of workers were union members in 2017, down from about a third of workers in 1945. That decline has played a big part in depressing wages, even in industries and companies that had never had a significant union presence. That’s because union contracts often serve as a benchmark for pay and working conditions. A 2015 analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that annual wages in right-to-work states were about 3 percent, or nearly $1,600, lower than in states that didn’t have such laws. "
1135,"ALEXANDRIA, Va. — Lawyers for Paul Manafort attacked the government’s star witness as a thief, serial adulterer and possible forger as part of an aggressive effort to undercut prosecutors on Wednesday at his trial. The defense lawyers also proposed novel situations under which their client’s tax avoidance may have been less extreme than prosecutors asserted. Mr. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, failed to disclose and pay taxes on nearly $16.5 million in income, according to an I.R.S. revenue agent. But his lawyers suggested that the actual amount of unreported income could have been smaller, partly because his companies might have been able to claim an “embezzlement deduction” on the money that his longtime deputy, Rick Gates, has acknowledged stealing through falsified expense reports. Mr. Manafort’s defense hinges on discrediting Mr. Gates, the main witness for prosecutors, and suggesting he was to blame for financial improprieties. The degree to which Mr. Manafort is relying on that strategy became evident on Wednesday when his lead lawyer, Kevin Downing, accused Mr. Gates of having four extramarital affairs and lying about them. Mr. Downing suggested that such a lie could invalidate a plea deal that Mr. Gates reached with the special counsel’s office to reduce his potential punishment in exchange for his cooperation in the case against his former boss, and possibly others. Mr. Manafort’s trial is the first to stem from the special counsel investigation into Russia’s election interference and possible coordination by Trump associates. Mr. Downing offered no evidence of either the affairs or Mr. Gates’s misrepresentation of them, and the judge, T. S. Ellis III, cut off the questioning before Mr. Gates could directly respond. Mr. Gates had admitted to a single affair a day earlier under questioning by Mr. Manafort’s lawyers. "
1136,"To the Editor: Re “G.O.P. Scramble in Safe District Jolts the Party” (front page, Aug. 7): Your reporting on the Ohio special election does not mention that once again the Green Party may have tipped an election to the Republicans. With 3,000-plus provisional ballots yet to be counted, the 1,127 votes siphoned off by the Green Party candidate, Joe Manchik, may very well be the deciding factor in this race. It is astounding that Green Party supporters keep helping to elect Republicans who then eviscerate everything the Greens supposedly stand for. This is sheer madness. Steven Morris
Mount Pleasant, S.C. To the Editor: Losing in a nail-biter really is not good enough to claim victory.

How much solace can we take from that? Bruce Neuman
Water Mill, N.Y. To the Editor: Re “Scrambling to Preserve House Edge, G.O.P. Pushes Polarization” (front page, Aug. 7): This headline is laughable, but to be expected from The New York Times. What do Chuck Schumer, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Tom Perez, Andrew Cuomo, Bill de Blasio, Dick Durbin, Maxine Waters, Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton have in common other than efforts to polarize voters? Polarization has become the mother’s milk of Democratic policy and politics. Gerald Katz

1137,"Some healthy soul searching is taking place in newsrooms across the country these days over whether the mainstream media should be covering President Trump’s every tweet and rally. My answer: Absolutely! It’s the right thing for us to do professionally, and, as last night’s election results indicated, it’s the right thing to do politically if you want to see a check on Donald Trump’s power. It appears that it’s the toxic lying, bullying and unpresidential behaviors that Trump exhibits most in his rallies and tweets — which we in the media so incessantly cover — that is turning off the very moderate, best-educated Republicans and suburban women that Trump will need to hold the G.O.P. majority in the House, let alone get re-elected. So bring on the coverage. America’s unemployment rate is 3.9 percent, inflation for the moment is moderate, the stock market keeps setting records, and the president is coming off a crisis-defusing summit with North Korea. And yet, the latest RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Trump having a personal approval rating of only 43 percent, with 53 percent disapproving of his performance. And in a special election in Ohio held on Tuesday, the G.O.P. House candidate — whom Trump and the entire Republican establishment went to bat for — is barely ahead of his Democratic rival in a district that has not sent a Democrat to Congress in more than three decades. That does not speak well for Trump or his midterm prospects, but it does for the American people and for thinking Republicans. It turns out there is still a cohort of Republicans who have not sold their souls to Trump the way virtually every one of their elected representatives in Washington has done. It turns out that there are thinking Republicans for whom character, decency and truth-telling still matter in a president. It turns out that there are thinking Republicans who have watched Trump’s twitter rants, his disturbed performance at Helsinki and the unrestrained bile that he emits at his rallies — and the blind, ecstatic response of his core base — and found them unnerving and unworthy of their support. That is what the polls and polling stations last night are telling us. Imagine how well President Trump would be doing if he weren’t Donald Trump — if he weren’t such a lying jerk. "
1138,"To Americans, Facebook’s Alex Jones problem might seem novel, even unprecedented. When does speech become unsafe? When can it be limited? Should those decisions be up to a private company at all? And if a company shies away from acting, as Facebook did with Mr. Jones until Apple moved first, where does that leave the rest of us? But to activists and officials in much of the developing world, both the problem and Facebook’s muddled solutions will be old news. Before there was Alex Jones, the American conspiracy theorist, there was Amith Weerasinghe, the Sri Lankan extremist who used Facebook as his personal broadcast station. Mr. Weerasinghe leveraged Facebook’s newsfeed to spread paranoia and hatred of the country’s Muslim minority. He enjoyed near-total freedom on the platform, despite repeated pleas from activists and officials for the company to intervene, right up until his arrest on charges of inciting a riot that killed one Muslim and left many more homeless. Before there was Mr. Weerasinghe, there was Ashin Wirathu, the Myanmar extremist, whose Facebook hoaxes incited riots in 2014. Three years later, Mr. Wirathu would contribute to a wave of Facebook-based rumors and hate speech that helped inspire widespread violence against Myanmar’s Rohingya minority. And so on. “Facebook doesn’t seem to get that they’re the largest news agency in the world,” Harindra Dissanayake, a Sri Lankan official, said a few days after Mr. Weerasinghe’s arrest. "
1139,"The most significant harbinger from the Ohio race may not be the narrow margin, but the turnout gap between the most and least heavily populated parts of a district that absorbs the close-in suburbs of Columbus and rural stretches of central Ohio. In both Franklin County, which includes Columbus, and Delaware County, the fast-growing suburb just north of Ohio’s capital, 42 percent of voters turned out. But in the five more lightly populated counties that round out the district, turnout ranged from 27 to 32 percent. This is an ominous sign for Republicans: The highest-income and best-educated elements of the electorate — those deeply uneasy with President Trump — are showing the most interest in voting. Defending a few dozen districts that are either more heavily urban or feature a similar demographic mix as Ohio’s 12th District, Republicans will need to find a way to win back suburbanites or better galvanize rural voters. If they do not, their House majority will slip away. [Get full results from Ohio here.] The activist wing of the Democratic Party mobilized for several of the night’s biggest races, trying to replicate the insurgent victory of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York earlier this summer — and for the most part falling short. In Michigan, Abdul El-Sayed, a youthful candidate for governor backed by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, lost a primary by about 20 percentage points to Gretchen Whitmer, a former Democratic leader in the state legislature. And in Missouri, Representative William Lacy Clay turned back a challenge from Cori Bush, who campaigned alongside Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and framed her candidacy in similar terms. "
1140,"A special election this near to the November midterms isn’t solely or even primarily about who won and lost. It’s about which candidate — and thus which party — beat the spread. It’s a crystal ball with a glimpse of the future, beyond the battle at hand and the patch of the country in which it took place. And the vision presented by Ohio’s 12th District on Tuesday night should give Democrats considerable joy. True, the race was too close to call Wednesday morning, and the Republican, Troy Balderson, had a definite edge over the Democrat, Danny O’Connor, in the vote count. But even if O’Connor loses, Democrats will move on from this contest with formidable energy and every reason to believe that Donald Trump is vulnerable, that Republicans are spooked and that the Democratic Party is poised to pick up the 23 seats it needs to reclaim the House majority. This should have been a Republican cakewalk. The district hadn’t been represented by a Democrat in more than three decades. The Republican incumbent, whose retirement is why the special election was necessary, won in 2016 by more than 35 points. In that same year’s presidential election, Trump won the district by 11. And he and Republicans pulled out all the stops to help Balderson. The president swept into town for a big rally on Saturday night. Vice President Mike Pence made his own trip. And Republican groups from outside the district pumped millions into the race, hugely outspending their Democratic counterparts. Even so, Balderson seemed to be barely squeezing out a victory. It’s a terrible sign for Republicans, a promising one for Democrats and a fascinating, revelatory turn of events on a night when the country’s mood in general — and voters’ attitudes about Trump in particular — came into slightly sharper focus. "
1141,"TOPEKA, Kan. — On the same night that a special congressional election in Ohio proved too tight to call, one of the most competitive Republican primaries for governor this summer was also deadlocked early Wednesday, as Kansas’s most populous county struggled to tally its votes in the race between Kris W. Kobach and Gov. Jeff Colyer. Mr. Kobach, a hard-right conservative endorsed by President Trump and known nationally for his grim warnings about voter fraud and illegal immigration, sent his supporters home from a watch party in Topeka just before 1 a.m. as he clung to a lead of a few hundred votes over Mr. Colyer, with 88 percent of precincts reporting. “Try to get a good night’s sleep,” Mr. Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, told the dozens of supporters who remained past midnight at a Topeka hotel as returns trickled in. “I don’t know if I’ll be sleeping much.” The long night came amid delays in counting the votes in Johnson County in suburban Kansas City, home to more than 500,000 people, where new voting machines were being used. Mr. Kobach, who in his current position oversees the state’s elections, said the results might not be finalized for hours. Mr. Colyer, a less polarizing but lesser-known conservative who ascended to the state’s top post earlier this year, was polling ahead of Mr. Kobach in Johnson County with several hundred precincts there still uncounted. The close results in Kansas came after Mr. Trump upended the race on Monday by endorsing Mr. Kobach against the advice of some of the party’s top strategists. "

1143,"This is not the very best week for political sons. First we have Cameron Collins, the 25-year-old offspring of Representative Chris Collins of New York, indicted with Dad on an insider-trading scheme. It is possible that they’re the first pair ever to be accused of conspiring during a congressional picnic. Meanwhile Donald Trump Jr. is twisting slowly in the wind while the president denies he’s worried that his kid will wind up in the clink. Oh, memories. Just two years ago, Donald Jr. and Collins, a super-enthusiastic Trump evangelist, spoke on the same night of the Republican convention. “Under Barack Obama we have been losing,” Collins told the crowd. It wasn’t exactly a highlight of the evening, but as it turned out, few people in the room had a keener understanding of the importance — and profitability — of spotting a loser. Collins was on the board of directors of an Australian biotech company, and its largest shareholder. (We will not be diverted into a discussion of the fact that he also sat on a House committee that oversaw medical business issues. If the Republican convention didn’t care, why should you?) Anyhow, the next year — at the Congressional Picnic! — he got a confidential email reporting that the firm’s big new drug was going to be a washout. And urgently passed the information to young Cameron, who dumped a ton of shares. Back to the Republican convention: After Representative Collins finished complaining about Barack Obama, Donald Jr. took the stage and rocked the audience with his prediction that Dad was going to run an administration for average Americans — “not a special class of crony elites at the top of the heap.” To be fair, you couldn’t expect Junior to realize that one of his fellow speakers was going to be accused of insider trading, which is sort of the definition of “special class of crony elites.” Or to foresee that his father’s future cabinet would boast an E.P.A. head who tried to use his job to help get his wife a Chick-fil-A franchise. Or that campaign chairman Paul Manafort had been spending a rather mysterious flood of money to treat himself to ostrich-skin outerwear. "

1145,"This week, Alex Jones, the persistently mendacious conspiracy-theory spouter — yeah, that’s a real job in 2018 — finally became the ultimate swipe left of the social media age. Apple, Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest, Spotify and most other major internet distributors banished Mr. Jones, either permanently or for some unspecified star-chamber-determined amount of time, for hate speech and other violations. But not Twitter. Instead, Jack Dorsey, the chief executive, founder and tweet inventor himself, took to his own platform to explain in the high-minded tone that one takes with small children that Mr. Jones wasn’t suspended from Twitter because he “hasn’t violated our rules.” In his multipart-tweet summer shower — it was not really a storm — he tried to make an exceptionally complex issue seem super simple, which is just like Mr. Dorsey. Of the recent crop of internet moguls, he is the most iconoclastic, employing elegant stylings and far-off stares that seem more hipster academic than the talented technical geek he is. Unlike others of his ilk who cannot hide their social awkwardness, Mr. Dorsey takes his inherent shyness and tries hard to make it look like he is floating serenely above the fray. His tweets were a variation on that theme. Mr. Dorsey insisted that Twitter was “not taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term, and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories.” "

1147,"What’s really alarming about President Trump’s preposterous tweets about the California wildfires is not what he gets wrong, which is plenty, but what they say about his stubborn refusal to grasp the basics of climate change and, perhaps worse, his administration’s contempt for the science that is drawing an ever-tighter link between a warming globe and extreme weather events around the world. Sunday night, Mr. Trump, in his first comments on the wildfires that have raged for weeks, said the fires had been “made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amount[s] of readily available water to be properly utilized.” A second tweet, on Monday, complained that water needed for fighting the fires was being “diverted into the Pacific Ocean.” In neither tweet was there mention of lives lost, the 600,000 acres of woodland so far consumed and the 1,100, and counting, homes destroyed. Dumbfounded state officials dismissed the president’s remarks as nonsense. Daniel Berlant, assistant deputy director of Cal Fire, the state’s fire agency, said, “We have plenty of water to fight these wildfires.” The most generous interpretation of Mr. Trump’s remarks was that he had been confused by complaints from California Republicans that state law, which seeks to allocate water among farmers, urban users and the environment, had unfairly favored fish over farmers. But even if that were true, which it is not, that ancient dispute has nothing to do with the availability of water for firefighting, which comes largely from lakes and ponds. Mr. Berlant made one other comment. “Let’s be clear,” he said, “it’s our changing climate that is leading to more severe and destructive fires.” Here, too, he was very much on point. Numerous studies that have sought to weigh the effects of climate change on the environment by teasing them out from other factors have concluded that human-influenced warming is increasingly a major player in a variety of natural disasters. An authoritative paper published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2016 looked specifically at forest fires in the Western United States and concluded that rising temperatures linked to climate change had been heavily responsible for the greatly increased range of these fires, mainly by intensifying droughts. Any doubts about global warming’s pivotal role in extreme weather events have been put further to rest by a long, hot and dangerous summer of climatological surprises. Add them up. Wildfires raced not only through California but also Greece and as far north as the Arctic Circle. Japan recorded its highest temperature in history, 106 degrees, in a heat wave that killed 65 people in a week. Europe continues to suffer through one of its hottest summers ever. “We know very well that global warming is making heat waves longer, hotter and more frequent,” said Corinne Le Quéré, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia in Britain, long a center for cutting-edge climate research. A preliminary analysis released last month by World Weather Attribution scientists said that climate change had made Europe’s scorching temperatures more than twice as likely. "
1148,"To inflict more pain on China, the Trump administration last week raised the ante in its trade war. It now promises that the next round of tariffs, on $200 billion in imports from China, will be 25 percent instead of the 10 percent announced earlier. President Trump exhorts his supporters that tariffs “mean jobs and great wealth.” If jobs and wealth are the metric for “winning the trade war,” China, not America, will emerge the victor. China will win not because of one-party rule, although it certainly helps President Xi Jinping weather difficulties caused by trade tensions. Rather, China will win because it is playing this game more skillfully. The tariffs imposed by the United States will mostly be paid by American companies and consumers, while China is retaliating with moves that soften the blow for companies in China, including those that are foreign-owned. To “win” a trade war on these terms, the United States would have to impose tariffs that somehow hurt the Chinese economy so badly that its leaders improve their treatment of American intellectual property, a longtime demand by American trade negotiators. The health of China’s economy depends on exporting to the United States, so, the thinking goes, the Chinese government will capitulate to American demands. This strategy is certain to backfire. First, about 60 percent of China’s exports to the United States are produced at factories owned by non-Chinese companies. Many of them produce customized inputs for American manufacturers, such as computer routers, LED fixtures and boat motors. That means the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration that are directed at China actually affect many American (and European) companies that own factories in China. These companies cannot immediately respond to tariffs by quickly moving their operations out of China. Instead, they will absorb the import tax or pass it along to American consumers in the form of higher prices. This is already happening: a 20 percent tariff on washing machines imposed in February was followed by a 16.4 percent spike in consumer prices for these products. So most of the revenue raised by the tariffs is coming out of the pockets of American consumers, not Chinese companies. "
1149,"The leader of the United Nations said on Wednesday that he had picked Michelle Bachelet, a prominent women’s rights advocate and the first woman to serve as Chile’s president, to be the organization’s next top human rights official. The announcement by Secretary General António Guterres ended the uncertainty over who would replace Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, a Jordanian prince and longtime diplomat who became one of the most forthright critics of abuses by governments in many countries, including the United States, during his four years as the high commissioner for human rights. Mr. al-Hussein said in December that he would not be seeking an extension of his term, which expires next month. He told colleagues that “to do so, in the current geopolitical context, might involve bending a knee in supplication.” Ms. Bachelet, 66, who was imprisoned and tortured during Chile’s right-wing dictatorship and years later became a pediatrician and politician, will be stepping into a particularly difficult and contentious role at the 193-member organization. Efforts to reach Ms. Bachelet in Chile were not immediately successful. The change comes as the Trump administration has taken an increasingly dim view of human rights diplomacy at the United Nations. The administration withdrew from the Human Rights Council in June, partly over the frequent criticism of Israel and other actions that the administration described as two-faced. After Mr. al-Hussein’s office criticized the White House over the practice of separating children from parents to deter undocumented immigrants, Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador, angrily accused it of ignorance and hypocrisy. "
1150,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. A breakthrough for women in governor’s races and a victory for labor unions in Missouri. Here are our five top takeaways from Tuesday’s polling in five states. Rashida Tlaib, above, won Michigan’s Democratic primary for the seat Representative John Conyers Jr. is leaving. Running unopposed in November, she is poised to be the country’s first Muslim congresswoman. The results of races in Ohio and Kansas are still too close to call. Republicans are rattled by the razor-thin margins there, and bracing for a tougher fight to keep control of Congress. _____ "
1151,"If Sharice Davids prevails in November, she would represent several firsts in Congress. She would be the first lesbian congresswoman from Kansas. She would be one of the first Native American women in Congress. (Deb Haaland, who won the Democratic primary in June in a blue district in New Mexico, could also be elected in November.) And she would be the first congresswoman who was once a professional mixed martial arts fighter. Ms. Davids became the Democratic nominee in the Third Congressional District in Kansas on Wednesday, according to The Associated Press. That sets her up against Representative Kevin Yoder, a Republican who has served since 2011. She defeated five other Democratic candidates, including Brent Welder, who earned support and a campaign rally appearance from two stars of the progressive left, Senator Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic nominee in New York’s 14th Congressional District. Ms. Davids, a lawyer who spent a year as a White House fellow as President Barack Obama handed off to President Trump, campaigned on a conventional Democratic platform, including expanded health care access, gun control and opposition to Mr. Trump’s tax breaks.

1152,"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week, everyone’s favorite summer topic: mosquitoes. Arctic ones! Also, a bit about Trump’s plan to freeze standards on automobile pollution. Ask just about any human and they’ll tell you that mosquitoes are pests we’d be better off without, especially since some mosquitoes carry deadly diseases. Even many scientists agree: A 2010 article in the journal Nature concluded that a world without mosquitoes would be less itchy and less deadly for us, with few drawbacks for other species, outside of some ecological niches. One of those niches is the Arctic, where mosquitoes play a bigger role in sustaining the ecosystem but may be threatened by the changing climate, said Lauren E. Culler, a research assistant professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College. “You can collect pollen off of mosquitoes, indicating they may have a role in pollination,” she said. “And we know that they’re also food for other organisms in the food web.” "
1153,"WASHINGTON — A new 20 percent tax break included in last year’s $1.5 trillion tax overhaul could wind up benefiting President Trump’s real estate empire given how the Treasury Department plans to implement the provision, several tax experts said. On Wednesday, the Treasury Department issued a sprawling regulation outlining the types of companies and professionals eligible to qualify as “pass-through” entities and get the 20 percent tax deduction. The widely anticipated rule has huge implications for law firms, real estate trusts, family farms and other companies that are structured so their profits are taxed as individual income for their owners. The 184-page rule probably means a windfall for authors and small banks, who appear eligible for the 20 percent deduction, but a disappointment for dentists, who are not. It takes some steps meant to stop individuals and companies, such as law firms, from gaming the loophole to reduce their tax bills. Tax experts say it appears to be largely a victory for business groups, who had argued for a more generous interpretation of a deduction that the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates will primarily benefit Americans earning $1 million and up. “It looks like Treasury took some of the major concerns of the business community and the tax community seriously,” said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist at the Tax Foundation in Washington. The regulation could also be a win for the president himself, because of how the regulation defines businesses that rely primarily on the “reputation or skill” of their owners to earn money. Those businesses are excluded from taking the deduction, but the regulation defines them narrowly, in a way that appears to allow the companies of the Trump Organization to qualify for the tax break at least in part. Liberal groups said the guidance, as written, will help some wealthy Americans take advantage of the deduction. “This is a provision that we always thought would provide a windfall to high-income taxpayers,” said Jacob Leibenluft, the executive vice president for policy at the liberal Center for American Progress. “These rules not only fail to change that outcome, but may in fact exacerbate it.” "
1154,"After Tuesday’s elections, President Trump cherry-picked results to make the case that his endorsement always produces victories for candidates. While candidates backed by Mr. Trump in Republican primaries have almost always won, four of his endorsed candidates have lost their elections. Republican voters did choose four out of the five candidates Mr. Trump backed in Tuesday’s primary elections. The fifth — Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state who is running for governor — is also leading in the polls, but the race is too close to call. In Ohio’s special congressional election, Troy Balderson, whom Mr. Trump endorsed in July, is leading his Democratic opponent by a razor-thin margin, but The New York Times and other news outlets have yet to declare a winner. Beyond Tuesday’s elections, Mr. Trump has endorsed at least 18 other winning candidates in primary elections. But Republican voters rejected one of his picks: Luther Strange, who ran for the party’s nomination in Alabama’s Senate election last year. Several of Mr. Trump’s endorsed Republican candidates — like Representative Karen Handel of Georgia, Representative Ron Estes of Kansas, Representative Greg Gianforte of Montana and Representative Ralph Norman of South Carolina — won special elections against Democrats last year. But three — Roy S. Moore in Alabama’s Senate race, Rick Saccone in a special Pennsylvania congressional race and Ed Gillespie in the Virginia governor’s race — lost their bids against Democrats. Mr. Trump also encouraged his supporters to vote for Representative Kevin McCarthy of California and “all of the great GOP candidates for Congress” in the state’s primary elections in June. Under California law, the top two finishers advance to the general election, regardless of party. While Mr. McCarthy did finish first in his primary, Republican candidates failed to qualify for the general election in California’s Senate race and its 44th Congressional District. "
1155,"Joseph Kabila, who took over the Democratic Republic of Congo at age 29 after the assassination of his father in 2001, announced on Wednesday he would not stand for re-election, raising hopes the country might carry out a peaceful transition of power for the first time in its modern history. Mr. Kabila had long overstayed his welcome as leader, and for two years, Congolese opposition groups, the African Union, the United States and the United Nations had all urged Mr. Kabila not to defy term limits and seek a third term in voting scheduled for December. This week, The Financial Times reported that the Trump administration was prepared to tighten financial sanctions against Mr. Kabila and his associates if he did not agree to relinquish power. In June 2017, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions against Gen. François Olenga, one of Mr. Kabila’s most senior military officials, and in December it put forward sanctions against Dan Gertler, an Israeli businessman who is close to the president. Opposition activists rejoiced at the president’s decision, but also cautioned that it was only a first step toward an orderly transition of power. “What matters for the moment is that the Constitution, whether willingly or not, has been respected,” said Senator Jacques Ndjoli, a member of an opposition party, the Movement for the Liberation of Congo. “Despite the multiple attempts to circumvent the Constitution, President Kabila finally understood that the supreme law applies to everyone.” The United States, too, voiced approval of the decision. “We welcome reports that President Kabila will not seek a third term in accordance with his country’s Constitution,” Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, said in a statement. "
1156,"The Columbia professor Adam Tooze might be expected to have precious little in common with Stephen K. Bannon, the shambolic former chief strategist to President Donald J. Trump. Tooze is a self-described “left‑liberal historian whose personal loyalties are divided among England, Germany, the ‘Island of Manhattan’ and the E.U.”; Bannon is a brawling, right-wing connoisseur of nationalist resentment. In “Crashed: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World,” Tooze, with his Oxbridge-trained ear for a withering epithet, calls Bannon “the sulfurous impresario of Breitbart.” There is, however, a significant point on which they both agree: The financial crisis of 2008, along with the bailouts that followed, exposed the seamy underbelly of a global economic system that was supposed to be so finely calibrated that political wrangling (unseemly, inefficient) was beside the point. As Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, told a Swiss newspaper just a year before the crisis, the world of 2007 was a central bankers’ paradise: “We are fortunate that, thanks to globalization, policy decisions in the U.S. have been largely replaced by global market forces.” Needless to say, the nonagenarian Greenspan has spent the last decade like a wide-eyed ingénue, declaring himself flabbergasted by events, while Bannon has ridden a populist-nationalist wave to the White House and beyond. In “Crashed,” Tooze shows how the upheaval of 2008 radiated outward, shaping not only the new economic order but the political free-for-all that stumped conventional pundits and scrambled traditional allegiances. He connects the mortgage crisis to the American banking crisis to the European debt crisis to the crisis of liberalism. Brexit, Trump, Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and China’s ever-escalating role in the financial system: Tooze covers them all and much more, in a volume that’s as lively as it is long — which is to say very, on both counts. Having published previous books on the turbulent post-World War I era and the economic policies of Nazi Germany, Tooze has made a specialty of financial collapse and historical disaster. He also understands the language of corporate balance sheets and sovereign debt deeply enough to know that he ought to use it sparingly, translating some of the most byzantine gibberish into elegant English. “The sort of thing that you could do in London but not in New York is exemplified by ‘collateral rehypothecation,’” he writes, rather menacingly, before nimbly breaking down what that means and why it matters. Several lucid sentences later, you’ll have learned, perhaps despite yourself, how the financial wizards of New York competed with the financial wizards of London, and how a worldwide daisy chain of banks turned into a ticking bomb. "
1157,"In the not too distant future, Representative Chris Collins will likely have his day in court to answer the insider trading charges that were leveled against him on Wednesday, but the Republican lawmaker may well be judged sooner — by voters in November. Mr. Collins, who was the first congressman to endorse Donald J. Trump in 2016, is running for his fourth term in a Buffalo-area seat that is one of the most conservative in New York. Mr. Trump carried the district with nearly 60 percent of the vote, his best showing in the state, and Democrats had harbored little hope of unseating Mr. Collins amid the broader fall House battleground. But the indictment of Mr. Collins is expected to change that. [Prosecutors accused Mr. Collins of engaging in brazen acts of insider trading. For more on the indictment, read here.] A spokeswoman for the campaign arm of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Meredith Kelly, now declared the seat to be “firmly in play.” The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan political handicapper, moved the seat from a “solid” to “likely” Republican in the hours after the indictment was unsealed. And Jeremy Zellner, a local Democratic leader and chairman of the Erie County Democratic Committee, said, “We’ve been contacted by people all over the country who want to help.” The timing of the indictment, less than three months before the election, would seem to pose a disadvantage to Mr. Collins. "
1158,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Voting in the U.S., deepening tensions between Saudi Arabia and Canada and what to make of Elon Musk’s big idea. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump’s lawyers rejected the special counsel’s latest terms for an interview in the Russia investigation, but made a narrow counteroffer that skipped any questions about obstructing justice. And here’s the latest in the increasingly seamy trial of Paul Manafort, where defense lawyers accused a longtime Manafort deputy, Rick Gates, of having four extramarital affairs and lying about them. And all of this as the results of voting in five states showed an increasing challenge for Republicans and the elevation of Rashida Tlaib, who is poised to become the first Muslim woman in Congress. Separately, Chris Collins, a New York lawmaker, above, was charged with insider trading. He was accused of tipping off his son and others to sell stock in an Australian pharmaceutical company before the results of one of its failed drug tests became public. _____ "
1159,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said on Wednesday that it would soon impose new sanctions against Russia in response to the attempted assassination in March of a former Russian spy living in England and his daughter. Under the terms of the sanctions, any attempt by an American company to obtain an export license to sell anything with a potential national security purpose — gas turbine engines, electronics, integrated circuits and testing and calibration equipment — will be automatically denied. Exporters can attempt to prove that the goods will be used for legitimate purposes, but that is a tough hurdle to clear. An administration official described the list of affected items as “enormously elaborate,” but outside experts said the actual amount of exports involved is fairly small because the Obama administration already banned exports to Russia that could have military purposes. Tougher measures are called for in the legislation, however, if Russia fails to prove that it is no longer using chemical weapons. “Today’s step is an important but moderate set of sanctions,” said Peter Harrell, a sanctions official in the Obama administration, adding that further sanctions expected in three months “could be among the most severe yet, but could also be quite modest, depending on where the Trump administration wants to go.” The sanctions were imposed under the provisions of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, which mandates that once the government has determined that a country has used chemical or biological weapons in violation of international law or even made “substantial preparations” to do so, sanctions must be imposed. "
1160,"On the evening of Aug. 8, 1968, Richard Nixon delivered his acceptance speech for the Republican nomination, which he had won the same day. James Reston of The Times called it “the greatest comeback since Lazarus.” For many Americans long accustomed to seeing Mr. Nixon lose, it was disorienting to see him on the rostrum so … victorious. The old scowl was gone, the hair was a little longer and, as his handlers promised, a “New Nixon” beamed reassuringly for the cameras. Yet it was a strange speech, alternating between genuine grace notes and darker rumblings from an American subconscious that was sullen and fearful after years of war and discord. Like tectonic plates grinding against each other, the tensions between these visions, alternatingly bright and horrific, would be difficult to resolve. Eight years earlier, Mr. Nixon had been a famously awkward candidate who tried much too hard, sweating it out to make it to all 50 states in 1960, while John F. Kennedy casually threw spiraling footballs for the photographers of Life and Look. But a lot had changed since then. Mr. Nixon’s handlers, especially the younger ones, included a new breed of TV executive, who understood that Mr. Nixon could reinvent himself with softer lighting, better angles and fewer appearances. That, in essence, was the New Nixon. They devised a savvy strategy, outlined by one of their own, Joe McGinnis, in his classic book “The Selling of the President, 1968.” Thanks to their tutelage, he now seemed a calmer kind of statesman who spoke gnomically once a day, with plenty of time to get the footage to the networks. The spread of color TV between 1960 and 1968 helped Mr. Nixon, too; it eliminated the ghostly pallor and 5 o’clock shadow that had terrified schoolchildren in 1960. Air conditioning, another miracle, reduced the pools of perspiration that glistened when the lights burned too brightly. Florida had already been good to Mr. Nixon, before the Republicans came to Miami. As Dwight D. Eisenhower’s running mate in 1952, he had pleaded poverty as evidence of good character during his famous “Checkers” speech. But in the intervening years, he had quietly amassed a fortune in Miami real estate, thanks to his close friend Bebe Rebozo, a well-connected Cuban-American. If Mr. Nixon seemed more confident, it may have had something to do with these properties, which made up almost half of his sizable wealth in 1968. His comeback had begun in Miami, in 1962, when he began to buy up parcels after losing the California governor’s race. The Republican convention was held partly in the Fontainebleau Hotel, whose architect, Morris Lapidus, once said, “If you create a stage and it is grand, everyone who enters will play their part.” The Fontainebleau was nearly as elaborate as its royal namesake in France. TV and movie directors had been coming for years (several memorable scenes from “Goldfinger” were set at poolside). Republicans went there from all over the country, representing a party that still had many different viewpoints. One young Republican who made the trek was Hillary Rodham, not yet Clinton. In her memoir, “Living History,” she described the week as “unreal and unsettling.” In one of the Fontainebleau’s elevators, she encountered John Wayne, complaining about the food. "
1161,"TOPEKA, Kan. — Kris W. Kobach, the hard-charging Kansas secretary of state, has long raised concerns about the integrity of America’s elections. He has warned the president that there is rampant voter fraud, crusaded for stringent voter identification laws and tried unsuccessfully to convince a federal judge that the handful of Kansans he caught voting illegally were merely “the tip of the iceberg.” Now Mr. Kobach, who oversees the state’s elections, finds himself in charge of a closely watched Republican gubernatorial primary that is far too close to call. Just 191 votes separated the two candidates on Wednesday with all precincts reporting. Some mail-in and provisional ballots were yet to be counted. A lengthy recount process seemed likely. The candidate holding the razor-thin lead? Mr. Kobach himself. This awkward coda to the long, tense primary campaign between Mr. Kobach and the sitting governor, Jeff Colyer, threatens to further divide long-feuding Kansas Republicans. Even before Tuesday’s voting Republicans had feared that Mr. Kobach’s nomination could imperil their hold on the governorship and a pair of congressional seats in November’s election. And now it forces Mr. Kobach toward an uncomfortable choice: Recuse himself from one of his office’s most important tasks, or oversee a sensitive and critical process where conflict of interest questions are unavoidable. [Here are key takeaways from Tuesday’s voting.] In a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Kobach said that he was declaring a “tentative victory” in the primary and planned to begin campaigning for the general election. But he said thousands of votes remained to be counted and conceded that Mr. Colyer could surpass him and clinch the nomination. “It is certainly possible that the result of the race could change,” Mr. Kobach, 52, said. “But, that said, it is imperative that the Republican Party not stand still.” "
1162,"LONDON — The gibe, ridiculing burqa-wearing Muslim women as “letter boxes” and “bank robbers,” was roundly condemned by the British political establishment. Perhaps more important than the substance of the remarks, however, was their author, Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary who quit last month after clashing with Prime Minister Theresa May over Britain’s break from the European Union, known as Brexit. The comments, in an article in The Daily Telegraph, prompted accusations on Wednesday that Mr. Johnson was taking a leaf from President Trump’s campaign book in his never-ending quest to become the Conservative Party leader and, ultimately, prime minister of Britain. In a Twitter post, Sayeeda Warsi, a Conservative politician, characterized Mr. Johnson’s words as a “dog-whistle” aimed at the anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim factions that inhabit both the Conservative and Labour Parties in Britain’s fractured politics. Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University, concurred, saying, “You can’t really see anything Boris does other than through the prism of his own leadership ambitions.” He added, “There’s no doubt he believes that using this kind of language will resonate with a certain kind of Conservative supporter, and that might do him good in the leadership contest to come.” "
1163,"Kansas Republicans appear to have thumbed their noses at the party establishment on Tuesday in the primary for governor, failing to persuasively back the sitting governor, Jeff Colyer, and instead leaving room to elect Kris Kobach, the state’s secretary of state — and quite possibly the most pernicious public official in America. This distinction is not conferred lightly. Mr. Kobach has labored for it long and hard, notably in the areas of voter suppression and nativism. He is best known for having been the vice chairman of President Trump’s ugly voter fraud commission, spawned in 2017 to root out the millions of illegal voters who Mr. Trump’s ego pathetically, and falsely, claimed had cost him the popular vote in 2016. The commission was dissolved this January, having failed to find any evidence of widespread fraud, but having succeeded in raising Mr. Kobach’s national profile and cementing his reputation as a master purveyor of Trumpism. Mr. Kobach on Wednesday declared victory at a noon news conference, acknowledging that only 191 votes separated him from Mr. Colyer and that the election result may change as provisional and other ballots are counted. Awkwardly, as the state's top election official, Mr. Kobach would be the person charged with overseeing any recount of votes. Unless he recused himself, which he has said he would not. Mr. Kobach is running for governor on a promise to “Make Kansas Great Again.” (#MKGA!) If it holds up, his primary election win, bolstered by a last-minute endorsement by Mr. Trump, will be another reminder that the political currents that delivered us this president still rage within the Republican base. When it comes to fearmongering about immigration, Mr. Trump is a newbie compared with Mr. Kobach. Starting with a failed run for Congress in 2004, Mr. Kobach has regularly sounded the alarm that illegal immigration and widespread voter fraud are destroying this nation. Indeed, he has suggested that fraud played a role in his congressional defeat. A former constitutional law professor with degrees from Yale, Harvard and Oxford, Mr. Kobach’s specialty is concocting creative legal arguments to achieve controversial political ends — such as, say, forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall. (His plan: use a provision in the Patriot Act to track and tax the remittances that undocumented immigrants send home to family members.) He was the brains behind the self-deportation proposal for which Mitt Romney was widely mocked in his 2012 presidential run. "
1164,"MIDDLEBURY, Vt. — For generations — maybe since the gold rush — California has been where our dreams gather, the Elysian coast where palm trees sway in the ocean breeze and entire industries rise to sate our fantasies and our appetites. A bite of an orange is endless summer. Now, in this scariest of seasons, California is also where our nightmares collect. At the moment, the largest fire in the state’s history burns out of control; Yosemite Valley is closed indefinitely because flames lick at its access roads; and Death Valley has just registered, for the second straight year, the hottest month in American history. Meteorologists are scrambling to make sense of a so-called fire tornado that lifted 39,000 feet from the fire that burned near the edges of the city of Redding, twirling for more than an hour and stripping the bark from trees. Ever since a record drought began near the start of the decade, a mild dread has hung over the state; now, you can see the smoke from San Diego to Lake Tahoe. Even the Pacific offers less relief — ocean temperatures are at a record high, and in any event, a federal government analysis last year warned that up to two-thirds of the state’s southern beaches may disappear as the sea rises this century. Like in most places, California’s troubles are made more acute by Washington’s descent into ideological delusions. President Trump is trying to revoke the state’s longtime authority to regulate automobile emissions within its borders even as he tweets nonsensically about the region’s hydrology. But the most basic decisions about the state’s future will be made in Sacramento, many of them by the end of the legislative session on Aug. 31, and those decisions could help steer a rudderless world through the gathering climate storm. "
1165,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s lawyers rejected the special counsel’s latest terms for an interview in the Russia investigation, countering on Wednesday with an offer that suggested a narrow path for answering questions, people familiar with the matter said. Jay Sekulow, one of Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers, confirmed that a response was sent but declined to comment on its content. Noting the documents that the White House has already provided, the president’s lead lawyer in the case, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said, “We’re restating what we have been saying for months: It is time for the Office of Special Counsel to conclude its inquiry without further delay.” The letter marked the latest back and forth in the eight months of negotiations between Mr. Trump’s lawyers and the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Last week, Mr. Mueller proposed a slightly altered format to the expansive interview he wants to conduct with the president. Mr. Trump’s lawyers did not reject an interview outright but included the narrower counteroffer, one person familiar with the response said. However, Mr. Trump’s lawyers do not want him answering questions about whether he obstructed justice, according to the person, who did not want to be named describing the private negotiations and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Giuliani would not comment on the contents but confirmed that the president’s lawyers had not rejected an interview altogether and had instead tried for an “avenue” that could work. The response indicated how far apart the two sides remain. Mr. Mueller wants to question the president on a range of issues, chiefly his associates’ contacts with Russia; possible coordination between his campaign and Moscow’s election interference; and the intent behind presidential actions that could be construed as attempts to obstruct the inquiry, including firing the F.B.I. director.

1167,"Secretary of State Kris W. Kobach of Kansas, clinging to the slimmest of leads in the Republican primary for governor, said Thursday night that he planned to recuse himself from the vote-counting process. Earlier in the evening, his opponent, Gov. Jeff Colyer, said that some local election officials had been provided incorrect information by Mr. Kobach that could suppress votes. “I’ll be happy to recuse myself,” Mr. Kobach, who oversees the state’s elections, said in an interview with CNN. Mr. Kobach, who has the endorsement of President Trump and has built a national reputation for warning of widespread vote fraud, suggested that his role in the Kansas count had been mostly symbolic anyway. The governor’s fiery recusal request, and Mr. Kobach’s pledge to comply, came after the nationally watched primary left the candidates separated by only 191 votes entering Thursday. In a letter, Mr. Colyer said some clerks had been provided incorrect information about which ballots to count, and he urged Mr. Kobach to appoint the state attorney general to handle future questions from local election workers. “It has come to my attention that your office is giving advice to county election officials — as recently as a conference call yesterday — and you are making public statements on national television which are inconsistent with Kansas law and may serve to suppress the vote in the ongoing Kansas primary election process,” Mr. Colyer wrote. That sour letter, sent just a day after both candidates called for Republican unity, underscored longstanding divisions within the state party and the extreme closeness of a nationally watched race in which thousands of votes have not yet been recorded. The extended counting process, which will last at least into next week and perhaps much longer, gives the already hopeful Democratic and independent candidates a chance to campaign while the Republicans remain mired in a primary.

1168,"WASHINGTON — Hundreds of companies have asked the Trump administration for a special break from its sweeping aluminum tariffs. Few have succeeded. One that managed to get an exemption is a Russian firm currently subject to Treasury Department sanctions. How Rusal America — a branch of a Russian metals giant controlled by an oligarch with close ties to President Vladimir V. Putin — managed to win an exclusion highlights the chaotic and unwieldy process surrounding President Trump’s tariffs. While Rusal and its controlling stakeholder, Oleg V. Deripaska, are restricted by American sanctions, one of the company’s dozens of exemption requests was granted by the Commerce Department in July, apparently for the simple reason that no American manufacturer objected. Department officials reversed the decision this week, after concluding that an American aluminum manufacturer had meant to object, but made a mistake in its paperwork. The Trump administration has cited national security concerns in imposing tariffs of 10 percent on aluminum and 25 percent on steel, saying a flood of cheap foreign metals could degrade the American industrial base and make the United States military and others too dependent on imported metals. The tariffs hit dozens of countries, including Canada, Mexico, China and Russia, as well as the European Union. To help American manufacturers obtain products they are unable to get from domestic suppliers, the administration established a process for companies to request exemptions. "
1169,"The Trump administration plunged thousands of migrant children into a frantic limbo this summer when it separated them from their parents in a bid to deter illegal immigration on the southwest border, igniting weeks of protest and litigation. But the chaos has obscured a much longer-running dispute over the future of another group of unauthorized immigrants: the nearly 700,000 young people who were brought to the United States as children by their parents, and who received temporary permission to live and work in the country through the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. A federal judge in Texas heard arguments on Wednesday in a bid by Texas and eight other states to end the program, which they say went beyond President Barack Obama’s authority and imposed a heavy financial burden on states saddled with the costs of illegal immigration. A coalition of border town mayors and business groups, including Southwest and United airlines, filed a brief in the case arguing that ending DACA and taking thousands of young workers out of the economy could cost $460 billion in economic activity over the next decade. Judge Andrew S. Hanen of the Federal District Court in Houston did not say when he would rule, and a host of questions — legal, political and economic — continue to swirl around one of the few significant immigration initiatives the federal government has advanced in recent years. Where do President Trump and Congress stand on the program? Though he had promised on the campaign trail to shut down the DACA program, President Trump wavered for months after he took office, praising the young people who had been helped and saying that he wanted to show them “heart.” The Trump administration ultimately announced it was canceling the program last September. It was up to Congress, administration officials said, to produce a solution for the young immigrants before their permits expired. But months of congressional haggling have led nowhere, and in the meantime, groups on both sides of the issue have turned to the courts in the hope of resurrecting the program — or ending it for good. "
1170,"[Update: Paul Manafort was sentenced to 47 months in prison on Thursday in this financial fraud case. Read the article here.] ALEXANDRIA, Va. — Judge T. S. Ellis III had dismissed the jury for the day, but he was not quite finished opining about what he saw as irrelevant and repetitive questioning of a witness in the financial fraud trial of Paul Manafort. Standing up so as to loom even larger over the courtroom, he angrily confronted Greg D. Andres, the lead prosecutor. “Look at me,” the judge demanded, slamming his hand on the wooden ledge. “When you look down, it’s as if to say, you know, that’s B.S., I don’t want to listen to any more from you.” “Don’t look down. Don’t roll your eyes,” he told Mr. Andres. And so for the second time that afternoon, the prosecutor had to try to convince the judge that he only looked down because otherwise, he said, he would “be yelled at again by the Court” for his facial expression when “I’m not doing anything wrong, but trying my case.” Judge Ellis, 78, is the formidable ringmaster of the greatest show in the United States District Court in Alexandria, Va., demanding both precise questioning and a breakneck pace in the trial of Mr. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman. "
1171,"Given the leftward tilt of the progressive groups that have sprung up across Central New York in the wake of the Trump presidency, Anthony Brindisi would seem an imperfect choice as their Democratic candidate for Congress. After all, Mr. Brindisi has an A rating from the National Rifle Association. He has already forsworn his support for Representative Nancy Pelosi’s leadership, should Democrats flip the house in November. And he devotes more airtime to burnishing his bipartisan credentials than he does to criticizing President Trump. But those qualities — in a district where Republicans outnumber Democrats by 30,000 voters — are precisely why many progressive groups upstate have given their stamp of approval to Mr. Brindisi, 39. They believe he is the kind of moderate Democrat who can unseat the Republican congresswoman, Claudia Tenney, an unabashed supporter of President Trump whose fiery rhetoric has become both a lightning rod locally and a late-night television punch line nationally. “Our hashtag is #OneTermTenney,” said Sarah Reeske, a co-leader of Indivisible Mohawk Valley, quoting the rallying cry of a larger grass-roots coalition, called Knit the District. “We are all committed to getting rid of Claudia Tenney. But Anthony is not ‘Republican Lite’ by any means. He is independent.” Mr. Brindisi, a state assemblyman, is one of four candidates in New York that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has added to its Red to Blue roster. The program is targeting more than 60 candidates nationwide with extra support — logistical and financial — in the hope of capturing the House of Representatives. "
1172,"In late June, Gen. Vincent Brooks, commander of United States Forces Korea, addressed a large uniformed crowd at an outdoor ceremony 40 miles south of Seoul. He christened a glittering new headquarters at United States Army Garrison Humphreys, usually referred to as Camp Humphreys, an American military base in the city of Pyeongtaek. Just two weeks earlier, President Donald Trump suggested in Singapore that American troops should be drawn down, if not removed altogether, from the Korean Peninsula, but Brooks made no mention in his remarks of any planned reduction, instead proclaiming that United States Forces Korea “will remain the living proof of the American commitment to the alliance.” In his own congratulatory message, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea said the partnership between his country and the United States has been “the foundation for peace and stability and paved the way for South Korea’s democratization and economic growth.” Since the end of the Korean War in 1953, the United States has operated upward of 175 military installations in South Korea, a country the size of Kentucky. Today, that number is closer to 90, due to a massive consolidation. Fourteen years ago, the Americans and South Koreans agreed to close and relocate three major bases to the once-sleepy outpost of Camp Humphreys: two near the North Korean border and the third at Yongsan in Seoul, the longtime headquarters of United States Forces Korea and its largest component unit, the Eighth Army. Camp Humphreys has since been modernized and expanded to more than 3,500 acres, at a cost of nearly $11 billion, 90 percent paid for by South Korea. It is now the largest American military base overseas. When it is fully populated, sometime in the next few years (there is no official deadline), it will host more than 18,000 soldiers and an additional 27,000 civilian employees, contractors, retirees and family members. [Get a weekly roundup of Times’ coverage of war delivered to your inbox. Sign up here] In June, I visited Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek and United States Army Garrison Yongsan in Seoul to document the impact of the evolving military presence on Koreans and Americans. The recent summits between North and South Korea, and between the United States and North Korea, have shifted the conversation from “total destruction” to peace. And President Trump’s offhand remarks in Singapore — not only about withdrawing 32,000 American troops from South Korea but also about canceling a forthcoming joint-military exercise — serve as a reminder that the American presence is not an immutable fact. For decades, every American soldier posted to South Korea attended orientation at the Yongsan Garrison, in central Seoul, before proceeding to his or her assigned base. Yongsan, meaning “dragon hill,” came into military use long before the Americans’ arrival. The Japanese, who colonized the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945, chose Yongsan as their army headquarters and built an array of walls, bridges, guard posts, offices and residences in brick and stone. After World War II, Korea was split at the 38th parallel, with the North controlled by the Soviets and the South by the Americans — the model for what would happen in Vietnam a decade later. The Korean War was fought over that boundary, when the North invaded the South. Seoul changed hands four times, and Pyongyang was carpet-bombed before the war ended in stalemate. Millions of civilians and service members were killed, and the peninsula was divided again along the same latitude. Choi Chi-sun was born in August 1953, just after the signing of the armistice. His parents had been refugees from the north of the peninsula and eventually found themselves in Pyeongtaek, then a collection of farming villages populated by fewer than 100,000 residents. With its natural harbor and proximity to China, Pyeongtaek, like Yongsan, had been used by Japan’s imperial army. The Americans, defending the South against Northern and Chinese forces, inherited and expanded K-6, the Japanese airfield that would later be called Camp Humphreys, and added another base, K-55, farther north, forcing dozens of families from their land. Bases and airfields bearing American names became a feature of the postwar landscape. "
1173,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration’s decision to impose tariffs on Canadian newsprint is hastening the demise of local newspapers across the country, forcing already-struggling publications to cut staff, reduce the number of days they print and, in at least one case, shutter entirely. Surging newsprint costs are beginning to hurt publications like The Gazette in Janesville, Wis., the hometown paper of the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, which has long felt a mandate to punch above its weight. The paper, with a newsroom staff of 22, was the first to publish the news in 2016 that Mr. Ryan would support the presidential candidacy of Donald J. Trump. And while its editorial board has endorsed Mr. Ryan countless times, the paper made national news when it chided him for refusing to hold town halls with his constituents. Now, with newsprint tariffs increasing annual printing costs by $740,000, The Gazette has made several cuts to its staff and is using narrower paper, reducing the number of stories published every day. “We’re all paying a huge price,” Skip Bliss, the publisher of The Gazette, said of the tariffs’ effect on the industry. “I fear it’s going to be a very difficult time. I think there’s probably going to be some casualties.” The newsprint tariffs are just one of several trade measures President Trump has rolled out as part of his administration’s effort to protect American manufacturers by stopping what he calls unfair trade practices. Tariffs were implemented in January, after the Commerce Department sided with North Pacific Paper Company, a paper mill based in Washington State, in a complaint alleging that Canadian manufacturers were selling newsprint at artificially low prices. Last week, publishers won a small reprieve when the agency said it would cap the anti-dumping tariffs at 16.88 percent, down from 22 percent and apply them to a single manufacturer, Catalyst Paper Company. But Commerce said it would also impose tariffs of up to 9.81 percent on several Canadian paper companies, including Catalyst, to counter subsidies that those manufacturers receive from the government. Catalyst, which had been exporting more than 425,000 metric tons of newsprint into the United States before the levies went into effect, will face total tariffs of more than 20 percent. "
1174,"MIDLOTHIAN, Va. — The Liberal Women of Chesterfield County did not exist when Representative Dave Brat, propelled by Tea Party-infused energy, shocked the Republican establishment in 2014 and defeated the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, in a primary triumph here that presaged even greater political upheaval two years later. Now they’re all up in his grill. Mr. Brat stunned Mr. Cantor, building an army of grass-roots supporters on the ground that was aided in the air by conservative commentators like Laura Ingraham and Mark Levin. Then he made waves of another kind last year, complaining to Republican supporters about women, their health care protests, and their dogged presence in his face. “The women are in my grill no matter where I go,” he moaned, adding, “They come up — ‘When is your next town hall?’ And believe me, it’s not to give positive input.” They haven’t gone away. A race that was once considered solidly in the Republican camp is now rated a tossup, and the Liberal Women of Chesterfield County are stirring women to come out in such great numbers that the Democratic nominee, Abigail Spanberger, a well-credentialed former C.I.A. officer, may make history of a different sort in a district that has been deeply Republican for decades. “Republicans are now feeling like me when the Tea Party emerged,” said Becky Stuart Conner, a member of the Chesterfield County group. For Republicans, Mr. Brat’s race is a bulwark in their defensive perimeter, the kind of district they must win to keep control of the House. The area’s mix of affluent suburbs and conservative rural stretches resembles the Ohio district where a Republican candidate in a House special election on Tuesday, Troy Balderson, clings to a narrow lead.

It’s been a wild week for Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign manager, who is being tried on numerous federal charges, including accusations that he hid more than $30 million in foreign income. His extravagant lifestyle has also drawn attention, notably his alleged purchases of jackets made of python and ostrich skin that cost well into the five digits. On “Full Frontal” Wednesday, Samantha Bee pointed to a damning Business Insider report that quoted hostile text messages purportedly from Manafort’s daughter. But Bee saved her sharpest spears for Donald Trump Jr., who could be on thin legal ice over his June 2016 meeting with Russians at Trump Tower. President Trump said on Twitter on Sunday that the meeting was held to “get information on an opponent.” Bee said there were other dealings in which Trump Jr. had failed to cover his tracks, including the Trump SoHo, a luxury condominium-hotel in Lower Manhattan that struggled to attract guests and buyers. Bee summed up the segment with a characteristically brutal jab. The Oscars on Wednesday announced a slate of changes, including shortening the broadcast and, more controversially, adding a category for “best popular film.” Jimmy Kimmel wants to know: Did he do something wrong?

1176,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • With three months until the midterm elections, this week’s voting revealed the vulnerabilities that Republicans face in many suburbs and with moderate voters. Key races in Kansas and Ohio remain undecided, but party veterans have an increasingly bleak view of their prospects this fall. Republicans can afford to lose only 22 seats to maintain control of the House. “There’s a real likelihood that they not only win the House, but they win it by 10 or 12 more seats than they need,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said of the Democrats. President Trump took credit for Republican candidates’ success on Tuesday, but he is also largely responsible for a political climate that undermines them, one of our White House correspondents writes. • Separately on Wednesday, Representative Chris Collins, a New York Republican, was charged with insider trading. He said he would remain on the ballot in November. "
1177,"Good morning on this heated Thursday. It’s the dawn of the dockless bike in New York City. This summer, 900 free-standing bikes have been installed in the Bronx, Staten Island and the Rockaways — with more wheels on the way in the coming weeks. But dockless bicycle fleets present a unique set of challenges: How do you make sure bikes are where they need to be? What do you do with broken bikes? And what’s the best way to get a bike out of a tree? Here in New York, those questions fall to Gil Kazimirov, 26, a general manager for Lime, one of our city’s four dockless bikes operators. We recently spent an afternoon in the Rockaways with Mr. Kazimirov as he made repairs, checked in on bikes and responded to complaints. But first, we helped him rebalance the fleet. “In a dockless system, people can park the bike anywhere, which means that bikes can end up in less popular areas,” Mr. Kazimirov said. “It’s my job to make sure that people can get a bike when and where they need it.” To accomplish that, Lime uses bike trip data to pinpoint “hot spots,” or locations where bikes are in high demand, and has employees move bikes to the hot spots from less popular areas. "
1178,"Stacey Abrams, the first black woman nominated for governor by a major party, is banking on her ability to mobilize progressive constituencies, convinced she can register and turn out tens of thousands of minority voters on Election Day. The black share of the Georgia electorate has been growing rapidly. The Atlanta Journal Constitution reported that the number of African-Americans voting in the May primary grew by 43 percent between 2010 and 2018, while white voters declined 9 percent. In 2017, the state population was 52.8 percent white — on the cusp of turning majority minority. Abrams is an outspoken proponent of the liberal agenda, from LGBT rights to gun control to automatic voter registration to the elimination of cash bail. After her primary victory, Abrams made this clear: “We are writing the next chapter in Georgia’s history, where no one is unseen, no one is unheard and no one is uninspired.” In an interview, Abrams, the former minority leader of the Georgia House of Representatives and a Yale Law School graduate, described the Trump administration as an “abomination.” Directly to the north of Georgia, Phil Bredesen, a former governor of Tennessee — who has capitalized on praise from a slew of notable local Republicans — is counting on the center to send him to the Senate. Bredesen’s primary night victory speech on Aug. 2 stands in sharp contrast to the one Abrams delivered in May: Tennessee is 73.9 percent white. In his latest digital ad, “What Republicans Are Saying About Phil Bredesen,” the campaign cites favorable comments from prominent Republicans, including Sen. Bob Corker and Representative Chuck Fleischmann. In an earlier television ad, Bredesen — a Harvard graduate with a degree in physics and a business executive who founded HealthAmerica Corporation — made his opposition to polarization explicit: “I’m not running against Donald Trump.” There are “a lot of things I personally don’t like about Donald Trump,” Bredesen says, On Tuesday, Democratic primary voters demonstrated a strong preference for centrist candidates; in May and June, they chose progressives. Looking toward the general election in November, there is evidence in support of both the Abrams and the Bredesen strategies. "

Elon Musk’s declaration that he’s (potentially) taking his electric carmaker off the public markets has everyone’s attention, from Wall Street to regulators. The big question: How will he pay for it? Bankers at Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and elsewhere on Wall Street are feverishly trying to figure out how to make the plan work — and secure an advisory role — despite being in the dark on Mr. Musk’s efforts. Their current thinking, according to the NYT: A full buyout is probably a nonstarter, but buying out enough shareholders to let the company delist its stock is more possible, and could be worth up to $20 billion. Meanwhile, the S.E.C. is investigating whether Mr. Musk just violated securities laws. It’s the last two words of his tweet that count here: “funding secured.” If they’re not entirely true, he’s probably in trouble. Investors are as likely as the regulator to push Mr. Musk to put up or shut up, and to tell them exactly where that funding was secured. (SoftBank turned him down, for starters.) Short sellers of Tesla shares, who lost more than $1 billion after Mr. Musk’s tweets, are holding firm. They think a deal won’t happen, in part because they believe no one will want to back it. "
1180,"President Trump cheered when Sinclair Broadcast Group, the nation’s largest operator of local TV stations and a leading voice for conservative views, made a $3.9 billion bid to buy Tribune Media. The consolidation would have created a company that could reach seven out of 10 American households. But not everyone was thrilled about the prospect of a company that could potentially challenge Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News as the country’s pre-eminent media outlet on the right. And once a key government agency turned against the deal, it became clear Sinclair would not be realizing its dream. That was made official on Thursday, with the announcement by Tribune that it was ending its merger agreement with Sinclair and would sue for breach of contract. In a statement that accompanied its second-quarter earnings report, Tribune said that Sinclair had not made good on its commitment to use its best efforts to obtain regulatory approval of the merger as quickly as possible by selling off TV stations and other assets. Instead, Tribune said, Sinclair tried to maintain control and engaged in “unnecessarily aggressive and protracted negotiations with the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission.” Sinclair did not respond to requests for comment. The deal’s official demise completed a stunning reversal for Sinclair. Earlier this year, the merger seemed almost assured of being completed, thanks in part to policy changes proposed or enacted by the F.C.C. and pushed for by Sinclair. The changes included an easing of the cap on how many stations a broadcaster may own and a relaxing of a restriction on advertising revenue and other resources shared by TV stations. The company had also become a favorite of Mr. Trump and has insisted that of all its stations run regular commentary segments that echo support administration policies. "
1181,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Billowing smoke from this year’s historic wildfire season in California has caused hazardous air conditions across the state, prompting air quality alerts and forcing many residents to take refuge indoors to avoid unhealthy exposure to bad air. Hazy skies and thick, smoky air aren’t just symptoms of the fire — they present their own dangers, even when wildfires themselves remain very far away. Poor air quality can have disastrous effects on people’s health: like coughing, sore throats, extreme wheezing among people with respiratory disease, and cardiovascular illness. Prolonged exposure to bad air can even work its way into your lungs and blood stream. Conditions in the San Joaquin Valley are particularly bad because of the natural geography and weather patterns of the region, experts say, even though the state’s major fires are elsewhere. As smoke drifts into the valley, mountains and the climate trap the pollution, which then gets pushed toward the ground because of the heat. Currently the Ferguson Fire and the Mendocino Complex Fires are dumping smoke into the region. “A good analogy is a clogged bathtub. You’re just putting more and more pollution into a limited space and it’s getting more concentrated, more concentrated, more concentrated,” said Jamie Holt of the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District. “We don’t create more pollution than other parts of the country, we actually create a lot less pollution,” she added. “But because we have this topography and meteorology, we have less ability to clear the pollution out.” "
1182,"In March, a liberal furor erupted when The Atlantic magazine briefly hired Kevin Williamson, a conservative writer with National Review. Several years earlier, Williamson had written a short tweet in which he seemed to suggest that women who obtain abortions should be hanged. Though he insists this is far from his real view, his fate was sealed when it turned out he had said something similar in a podcast. He was fired almost immediately. I defended Williamson at the time, but not on account of any potential misinterpretation of his abortion views. My main point was that we should be judged on the totality of our work, and that we are more than just a collage of quotes from our social-media history or some foolish utterances from the near or distant past. “Your critics show bad faith when they treat an angry tweet or a flippant turn of phrase as proof of moral incorrigibility,” I wrote. “Let he who is without a bad tweet, a crap sentence or even a deplorable opinion cast the first stone.” Not surprisingly, some on the left pilloried me for that argument. So allow me to apply precisely the same logic in defense of my soon-to-be colleague at The Times, Korean-American technology writer Sarah Jeong, who is joining the editorial board with her own extensive history of unfortunate tweets. Among these: “White men are bull—”; “#CancelWhitePeople”; “oh man it’s kind of sick how much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men” and “f— white women lol.” She has also bashed the police, called for censoring a fellow journalist, and believed the 2014 University of Virginia rape hoax, in the course of which she lashed out at “white men” and “white college boys.” "
1183,"SEOUL, South Korea — Senior officials from North and South Korea will meet next week to discuss the possibility of a third summit meeting between their countries’ leaders, the South said on Thursday. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Moon Jae-in of the South have already met twice this year, in April and in May. South Korean officials have recently expressed interest in holding a third meeting soon, in hopes of breaking an impasse between North Korea and the United States over the dismantling of the North’s nuclear arms program. Mr. Moon has accepted an invitation from Mr. Kim to visit Pyongyang, the North’s capital, in the fall. But no date has been set, and it is unclear whether the proposed third summit would be held there. A meeting at Panmunjom, the so-called truce village on the inter-Korean border where the previous talks were held, would take much less time to arrange. The South’s Unification Ministry said on Thursday that North Korea had proposed holding ministerial-level talks at Panmunjom on Monday to discuss preparations for another summit meeting, and that South Korea had quickly accepted the offer. At their April 27 meeting, which was the first time Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon met, the two reached a broad agreement on easing military tensions and improving their countries’ ties. They also said that “complete denuclearization” of the Korean Peninsula was a shared goal. That meeting, and the one that followed at Panmunjom on May 26, helped to lay the groundwork for Mr. Kim’s historic talks with President Trump on June 12 in Singapore, the first time sitting leaders of the United States and North Korea ever met.

1184,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A close look at the global heat wave, a deadly airstrike in Yemen and a gender milestone for the U.S. Marines. Here’s what you need to know: • The world is getting hotter, faster. Globally, this is shaping up to be fourth-hottest year on record — the only years hotter were the three previous ones. The devastating effects have been felt from California to Greece to Japan. Above, air-conditioners in New Delhi. And it’s too early to call it the new normal: Temperatures are still rising, and, so far, efforts to tame the heat have failed. On the horizon is a future of cascading system failures threatening basic necessities like food supply and electricity. “It’s not a wake-up call anymore,” a climate expert said. “It’s now absolutely happening to millions of people around the world.” _____ • Pre-emptive diplomacy. The Times has learned that senior U.S. national security officials, seeking to prevent President Trump from upending a formal policy agreement at last month’s NATO meeting in Brussels, pushed the military alliance’s ambassadors to complete it before the forum even began. "
1185,"Consider a few facts: Donald Trump is in the White House, despite winning almost three million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton. The Senate, the country’s most powerful legislative chamber, grants the same representation to Wyoming’s 579,315 residents as it does to 39,536,653 Californians. Key voting rights are denied to citizens in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and other United States territories. The American government is structured by an 18th-century text that is almost impossible to change. These ills didn’t come about by accident; the subversion of democracy was the explicit intent of the Constitution’s framers. For James Madison, writing in Federalist No. 10, “Democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention” incompatible with the rights of property owners. The byzantine Constitution he helped create serves as the foundation for a system of government that rules over people, rather than an evolving tool for popular self-government. Writers on the left such as Jacobin’s Seth Ackerman and the journalist Daniel Lazare have long argued that constitutional reform needs to be on the agenda. Even some liberals like Vox’s Matthew Yglesias rightly worry that the current system of governance is headed toward collapse. These perspectives are vital at a time when many progressives regard the Constitution as our only line of defense against a would-be autocrat in the White House. Yet whether or not the president knows it, the Constitution has long been venerated by conservative business elites like himself on the grounds that it hands them the power to fend off attempts to redistribute wealth and create new social guarantees in the interest of working people. There’s a reason we’re the only developed country without guarantees such as universal health care and paid maternity leave. While preserving and expanding the Bill of Rights’s incomplete safeguards of individual freedoms, we need to start working toward the establishment of a new political system that truly represents Americans. Our ideal should be a strong federal government powered by a proportionally elected unicameral legislature. But intermediary steps toward that vision can be taken by abolishing the filibuster, establishing federal control over elections and developing a simpler way to amend the Constitution through national referendum. How hard would change be? As Mr. Ackerman reminds us, while constitutional change is straightforward and feasible in most countries, “an amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires the consent of no less than thirty-nine different legislatures comprising roughly seventy-eight separately elected chambers.” But it’s a problem worth confronting. As long as we think of our Constitution as a sacred document, instead of an outdated relic, we’ll have to deal with its anti-democratic consequences. "
1186,"President Trump has repeatedly and vehemently denounced what he calls “chain migration,” in which adult American citizens can obtain residency for their relatives. On Thursday, his Slovenian in-laws, Viktor and Amalija Knavs, became United States citizens in a private ceremony in Manhattan by taking advantage of that same family-based immigration program. Asked if the Knavses had obtained citizenship through “chain migration,” their lawyer, Michael Wildes, said, “I suppose.” He said chain migration is a “dirtier” way of characterizing what he called “a bedrock of our immigration process when it comes to family reunification.” Melania Trump had sponsored her parents for their green cards, Mr. Wildes said in describing the process by which the Knavses had become United States citizens. “Once they had the green card, they then applied for citizenship when they were eligible,” he said. Even as his in-laws were going through the process, Mr. Trump was denouncing it. In November, he tweeted, “CHAIN MIGRATION must end now! Some people come in, and they bring their whole family with them, who can be truly evil. NOT ACCEPTABLE!” "
1187,"WASHINGTON — Senior American national security officials, seeking to prevent President Trump from upending a formal policy agreement at last month’s NATO meeting, pushed the military alliance’s ambassadors to complete it before the forum even began. The work to preserve the North Atlantic Treaty Organization agreement, which is usually subject to intense 11th-hour negotiations, came just weeks after Mr. Trump refused to sign off on a communiqué from the June meeting of the Group of 7 in Canada. The rushed machinations to get the policy done, as demanded by John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, have not been previously reported. Described by European diplomats and American officials, the efforts are a sign of the lengths to which the president’s top advisers will go to protect a key and longstanding international alliance from Mr. Trump’s unpredictable antipathy. Allied ambassadors said the American officials’ plan worked — to a degree. Mr. Trump did almost blow up the two-day meeting in Brussels that began on July 11. He issued a vague threat that the United States could go its own way if allies resisted his demands for additional military spending. After the gathering, he also questioned a pillar of the alliance: that an attack on one NATO country is an attack on all. But the approval of the communiqué — renamed for the meeting as a declaration — was critical for the alliance. It ensured that, despite Mr. Trump’s rhetorical fireworks, NATO diplomats could push through initiatives, including critical Pentagon priorities to improve allied defenses against Russia. “The president’s national security team did a good job of salvaging a minimally successful outcome to the NATO summit,” said James G. Stavridis, a retired four-star admiral who also once served as the supreme allied commander for Europe. "
1188,"WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence promoted a proposed Space Command on Thursday as “an idea whose time has come” in comments at the Pentagon to unveil a few more details about President Trump’s plan to create another military force, this one for outer space, and for it to be in operation by 2020. Mr. Trump’s space dreams still have to go through a divided Congress to come true, but initially reluctant Pentagon officials have lined up behind the proposal and now say that they will do what they can to bring it to fruition. “The time has come to write the next great chapter in the history of our armed forces, to prepare for the next battlefield where America’s best and bravest will be called to deter and defeat a new generation of threats to our people, to our nation,” Mr. Pence told an audience at the Pentagon. He called for Congress to allocate an additional $8 billion for space security systems over the next five years. Mr. Trump, for his part, posted on Twitter on Thursday: “Space Force all the way!” But that may be a tall order. The administration cannot just create a Space Force on its own; it has to go through Congress, where critics abound. Even Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was once a critic. In a letter last year when Congress was considering a space corps, Mr. Mattis said he did not want to add “additional organizational and administrative tail” to the military. He said a space corps “would likely present a narrower and even more parochial approach to space operations.” "
1189,"Michael Grimm has some tough truth for Representative Chris Collins, the New York Republican indicted on Wednesday for insider trading: It might seem bad now, and it won’t get better anytime soon. “He’s going to have a really, really difficult emotional time,” said Mr. Grimm, who is also a New York Republican. “And whether he knows it or not, a lot of Washington is going to look at him as a pariah.” Mr. Grimm would know. He, too, was indicted while serving in Congress. He, like Mr. Collins, professed his innocence. And he, like Mr. Collins, ran for re-election anyway. And won. The brotherhood of members of Congress who have won re-election while under indictment is exceedingly small and its most recent, and vocal, inductee is Mr. Grimm, who carried his Staten Island seat back in 2014 despite the weight of a 20-count indictment on his shoulders. Mr. Grimm never did make that next term. He pleaded guilty to tax evasion and instead went to prison. But he said his case could provide a road map of sorts for Mr. Collins: Dig in, hire good lawyers (read: expensive), expect to be pummeled in the press and find something, anything else to run on and talk about. “He’s going to have to swallow every bit of it. And smile,” Mr. Grimm said. “He should go right back to his job and remain professional.” "
1190,"WASHINGTON — Brett M. Kavanaugh volunteered to prepare a senior Bush administration official to testify about the government’s monitoring of conversations between certain terrorism suspects and their lawyers after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, a newly disclosed White House email shows. The email appeared likely to become a focus at Judge Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing this year. Democrats have suggested that he misled the Senate at his 2006 appeals court confirmation hearing, when he turned aside questions about the George W. Bush administration’s handling of terrorism suspects by saying that he was “not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants” and by portraying his portfolio as focusing on “civil justice issues” like terrorism insurance. The email, released Thursday, was part of a trove of about 5,700 pages of documents involving Judge Kavanaugh’s time as an associate White House counsel. Republicans portrayed the release as the start of an effort to be transparent about Judge Kavanaugh’s work in the Bush administration, while Democrats complained that the vast majority of such files remained hidden from public view. Most of the files released Thursday appeared to carry little significance, consisting mainly of Bush White House staff members circulating news and opinion articles or setting up meetings. But the email about the monitoring of terrorism suspects’ attorney-client communications stood out, and — anticipating controversy — the White House had prepared a detailed explanation about its context. The email was a response to a Justice Department request that the White House help prepare Attorney General John Ashcroft for a December 2001 oversight hearing about several post-Sept. 11 actions by the department, including “military tribunals, monitoring of atty/client conversations, racial profiling, etc.” "
1191,"The Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk had to wait until she was 28 to receive a passport and make her first trip abroad. Like many Poles, Ms. Tokarczuk (pronounced To-KAR-chook) rejoiced when over 40 years of Soviet-induced international isolation finally came to an end. The destination was hardly an exotic one — East Germany in 1990 — but it signaled the beginning of Ms. Tokarczuk’s love affair with travel and a delectable way of writing about it that continues to evolve. In May, Ms. Tokarczuk won the Man Booker International Prize for her novel “Flights,” which treats travel as a uniquely corporeal experience. “Flights” is made up of 116 vignettes — both fiction and nonfiction — ranging from a Polish man’s desperate search for his wife and child after they disappear during a vacation in Croatia, to a historical account of Chopin’s heart being smuggled into Warsaw beneath his sister’s skirt. Critics have compared Ms. Tokarczuk’s nonlinear novels and short stories, which are often punctuated by mysterious maps and diagrams, to the work of celebrated European authors like W.G. Sebald and Milan Kundera. With “Flights,” Ms. Tokarczuk, 56, became the first Polish writer to win the British prize which is now awarded annually to a book in English-language translation. The Polish-born British writer Lisa Appiganesi, who chaired the judging, commended Ms. Tokarczuk’s novel for its narrative voice “which moves from wit and gleeful mischief to real emotional texture.” “Flights,” which sold over 160,000 hardcover copies when it was published in Poland in 2007 and won the country’s prestigious Nike Award, is being released in the United States by Riverhead Books on Aug. 14. In a recent Skype interview Ms. Tokarczuk said that when she began writing “Flights,” more than a dozen years ago, she set out to describe a world very different from the one we are living in now. “I wrote this book when the world was looking to be open for everybody,” she said. “Now we’re seeing how the European Union will probably become weakened by the policies of countries like Poland and Hungary, which are focused on their borders once again.” Speaking from her home in Wroclaw in southwestern Poland, Ms. Tokarczuk also referenced President Trump’s plan to build a wall on the United States border with Mexico. “Twelve years ago there was no mention of the idea of walls or borders, which were originally adopted by totalitarian systems,” she said. “Back then I must admit that I was sure that we had put totalitarianism behind us.” "
1192,"To the Editor: Re “Trump’s Legal Team Proposes Narrower Interview” (news article, Aug. 9): When is a United States citizen who is involved in an investigation allowed to negotiate what questions can be asked? The president’s legal team is making a mockery of this investigation in regard to President Trump’s testimony. Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, should just issue a subpoena to the president as he would to any other citizen and let the courts decide. Richard Cohen

1193,"The classic car market has been buoyant over the last 15 years or so. And those collectors who bought cars during the Great Recession-induced market dip probably have some handsomely appreciated assets in their garages. But car connoisseurs looking to trade up have now lost a valuable tax benefit, and the top end of the market may be feeling a pinch as a result. Collectors who were tempted to trade up to a rarer, prettier and pricier car used to be able to take advantage of a provision of the Internal Revenue Code allowing them to defer the tax on their original car’s appreciation. The provision — the 1031 like-kind exchange — was prized by art collectors and became almost as common in the car aficionado’s lexicon as wire wheels and big-block engines. But a change in the tax code in last year’s overhaul put the brakes on the merry-go-round of up-trading. “It really has taken some great cars out of the market,” said Mark Hyman, a classic-car dealer in St. Louis. “Very valuable cars that have been in the same hands for a lot of years aren’t being offered for sale because the owner’s basis is low and he or she doesn’t want to pay the tax.” This month, the collector-car world will gather in Monterey, Calif., where the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elégance promises to showcase the finest vehicles on the planet. No fewer than six high-end auctions will take place the week before the event opens on Aug. 26. "
1194,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Will Have Blood on His Hands” (column, Aug. 4): Bret Stephens addresses the very real danger of President Trump’s hateful rhetoric toward the media after Mr. Stephens himself was threatened in a voice-mail message. The caller said that “the press is the enemy of the United States people and, you know what, rather than me shoot you, I hope a Mexican and, even better yet, I hope a n— shoots you in the head, dead.” The three-plus years of Mr. Trump demeaning the press and calling it the “enemy of the people” should remind everyone of the long tirades of Glenn Beck on Fox News, in which he called liberals a danger to our nation. In July 2010 that rhetoric led Byron Williams to load his car with rifles and ammunition in a failed attempt to kill liberals at the American Civil Liberties Union and the Tides Foundation in San Francisco. Speech may be protected by our Constitution, but it is not “free.” It can have a cost, including bloodletting, as Mr. Stephens rightly points out. While the vast majority of Trump supporters would never take lethal action against reporters, it takes only one like Byron Williams. Richard Haas
Sunnyvale, Calif. To the Editor: Most Americans do not believe that the press is the enemy of the people. Insisting that this administration threatens a free press is just one more means of browbeating it. Bias in the media has always been with us. “Fake news” is just the new nickname for the left-wing variety. The responsible citizen assembles a mix of news sources to get the whole story. Here’s my advice for anyone truly interested in a balanced view. Ignore all Twitter quotes, including the president’s. The allotted space for a Twitter message is better suited to cheap shots than responsible commentary. Dismiss the drama queens of most TV news shows. They are selling ads. Make an exception for the dispassionate who deliver “PBS NewsHour.” After that, digest print media only, one paper leaning left and one leaning right. Seek out reports from journalists interested in policy, not the trading of insults. You will be surprised how refreshing this approach is. You are now ready to face the day — informed, objective, calm and confident that all will be well in the end. Margaret McGirr
Webster, Mass. To the Editor: In Ibsen’s 1882 play “An Enemy of the People,” it is the truth teller who becomes the enemy of the people, because he exposes the moral rot in his community. The American media should be proud of its role in exposing the racism, corruption, dishonesty, child abuse and treasonous behavior of President Trump and his administration. The American media is the truth teller that truly “tells it like it is.” Howard Golden

1195,"WASHINGTON — Carla Provost, who has been serving as acting chief of the Border Patrol, will take over as leader of the agency on a permanent basis, Customs and Border Protection announced Thursday. Ms. Provost, who was appointed acting chief of the Border Patrol last year, will become the first woman to lead the Border Patrol in its 94-year history. Kevin K. McAleenan, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, made the announcement during a morning ceremony at the agency’s headquarters. Mr. McAleenan called the appointment historic and praised Ms. Provost as an “agent’s agent” who had earned the respect of agency personnel from Border Patrol agents to the top leadership. “She has come up through the ranks, and has earned each new role with hard work, perseverance and her willingness to do whatever the Border Patrol asked of her,” he said. The promotion comes as no surprise since Ms. Provost has been leading the Border Patrol for over a year. But her choice as a chief of the border agency is a significant milestone for women there. Currently, women in the Border Patrol make up only about 5 percent of the agents, one of the lowest proportions among federal law enforcement agencies. In an interview, she said the agency is actively trying to recruit more women. "
1196,"MOSCOW — Russia’s currency fell on Thursday to its lowest dollar value in nearly two years, jarred by new American sanctions imposed in response to a nerve-agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain. For several years, the Russian economy has appeared able mostly to shrug off the effects of a series of Western sanctions tied to its incursions into Ukraine and its election meddling. Buoyed by rising oil prices, the economy even grew modestly this year. But the ruble’s precipitous decline may be a clear sign that the sanctions have begun to cloud the country’s long-term economic outlook. As the ruble slumped through the day, officials in Moscow expressed dismay that the new restrictions came so soon after what they saw as a positive summit meeting between President Trump and Vladimir V. Putin, in Helsinki, Finland last month. “Such decisions made by the American side are absolutely unfriendly, and you cannot associate them with the constructive, even if difficult, atmosphere we had during the last meeting of the two presidents,” Dmitry S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told journalists in a conference call. When Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin met, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey L. Lavrov, called the summit “better than super” for Russia. But investors were taking a different view this week. "
1197,"When the National Rifle Association brought its Carry Guard insurance program to New York in April of last year, it marketed it as the solution to a pressing concern among its loyal followers, a protection against legal fees that could arise from firing a weapon in self-defense. That solution has now become a new problem: It is the latest fodder in Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s long-running clash with the N.R.A., as he seeks to ban Carry Guard not only in New York but across the nation. The powerful gun-rights group, in turn, has sued New York State, casting the battle in life-or-death terms and arguing that if Mr. Cuomo prevails, the N.R.A. could be left “unable to exist.” That existential lamentation created a ready-made political opportunity — and Mr. Cuomo seized on it. He has made the rounds on the morning news shows, mounting a national campaign to encourage other governors to follow his lead in banning Carry Guard. He has rolled out campaign ads promising to take the N.R.A. “to the brink.” He has posted a torrent of pithy posts on Twitter sending his “thoughts and prayers” to the supposedly beleaguered organization. "
1198,"— Sarah Huckabee Sanders, at a White House news briefing on Tuesday Ms. Sanders was responding to questions about whether Mr. Trump has ever used a racial slur. She said the president’s policies have helped black people. But it is not true that the Trump administration has already created three times as many jobs for black Americans as the Obama administration did. According to the latest data available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 708,000 more black Americans had jobs in July than in January 2017, the month Mr. Trump took office. By contrast, the same data show, the economy added about three million jobs for black Americans between January 2009 and January 2017, during Mr. Obama’s presidency. Mr. Obama took office at the height of the Great Recession, when the unemployment rate for black Americans was 12.7 percent. It increased to almost 17 percent, in March 2010, and then fell to 7.8 percent by January 2017, Mr. Obama’s last month in office. The black unemployment rate has continued to fall under Mr. Trump and was 6.6 percent in July. Ms. Sanders did not clarify what time frame she was referring to when comparing the numbers during Mr. Obama’s presidency to Mr. Trump’s. "
1199,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. A grand jury found Catholic leaders across Pennsylvania covered up the sexual abuse of at least 1,000 children by priests over a period of 70 years. The report, the broadest examination by a U.S. agency of child abuse in the Catholic Church, found that bishops and other leaders persuaded victims not to report cases of abuse and police officers not to investigate them. It catalogs horrific cases of abuse, including a priest who raped a young girl in the hospital after she had her tonsils out. “Priests were raping little boys and girls,” the grand jury wrote, “and the men of God who were responsible for them not only did nothing; they hid it all. For decades.” _____ "
1200,"The call to arms came in the form of a memo. Marjorie Pritchard, the deputy managing editor of The Boston Globe, reached out to editorial boards at other newspapers last week. “We propose to publish an editorial on August 16 on the dangers of the administration’s assault on the press and ask others to commit to publishing their own editorials on the same date,” the memo said. As of Tuesday, more than 200 newspapers, including The New York Times, had signed on. The Globe’s effort to rally editorial writers across the country came in reaction to the president’s stepped-up attacks on the media. At a recent rally in Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump pointed to the group of journalists covering the event, saying they “only make up stories” and called them “fake, fake disgusting news.” On Twitter, he has revived an old phrase — “the enemy of the people” — to describe “much of the media” and “the Fake News Media.” Last month, at a news conference in Britain, he refused to call on the CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta, saying, “CNN is fake news. I don’t take questions from CNN.” A week later, the White House barred another CNN reporter, Kaitlan Collins, from attending a public appearance by President Trump in the White House Rose Garden, after she had called out questions during a photo opportunity earlier in the day. “We’re not the enemy of the people,” Ms. Pritchard, who oversees The Globe’s opinion section, said in an interview. “We thought that a coordinated effort across the country would make a powerful statement about the importance of a free press.” "
1201,"What if this time is different? There is an assumption that the 2020 presidential election will be business as usual: Donald Trump will run on the economy, social issues and immigration, and the Democratic candidate will run on income inequality, Democratic socialism and Trump’s character — the 2020 version of right-left U.S. politics. But I believe there’s a sleeper issue out there that could force its way into the election. What if Mother Nature is on the ballot? What if all the extreme weather this year — linked to climate change — gets even worse and more costly? What if the big 2020 issue is not left-right — but hot-cold or wet-dry? What if the big 2020 issue is not “Who lost Russia?” or “Who lost North Korea?” but “Who lost planet Earth?” We’re talking about the natural world, so one has to be cautious. But if you look at all the destructive extreme weather buffeting the world this summer alone, it’s as if Mother Nature were saying to us: “Oh, you didn’t notice me tapping on your shoulder these past few years? O.K. Well, how about a little fire, Scarecrow? How about this: “How about I bake Europe, set the biggest wildfire California has ever seen and more active wildfires — 460 in one day — than British Columbia has ever seen, and also start the worst forest fires in decades in Sweden, even extending north of the Arctic Circle where temperatures this month reached 86 degrees. Meanwhile, I’ll subject Japan to the heaviest rainfall it’s ever recorded, and then a couple weeks later the highest temperature it’s ever recorded — 106 degrees in Kumagaya, northwest of Tokyo. And for a punctuation mark, I’ll break the heat record in Death Valley, reaching 127 degrees, and burn the worst drought in living memory into Eastern Australia, where the BBC last week quoted a dairy farmer as saying, “It’s gotten to the point where it’s cheaper to shoot your cows than it is to feed them.” While climate scientists have long argued that you can’t attribute any single weather event to climate change, a study last year by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine concluded: “The science has advanced to the point that this is no longer true as an unqualified blanket statement. In many cases, it is now often possible to make and defend quantitative statements about the extent to which human-induced climate change … has influenced either the magnitude or the probability of occurrence of specific types of events or event classes.” Climate change makes the hots hotter, the wets wetter and the dries drier. Heidi Cullen, chief scientist for Climate Central, an environmental organization, was quoted as telling the Weather Channel in July that the national academies’ report connecting global warming to the increased risk and severity of certain classes of extreme weather — like some of the heat waves, floods and droughts we’re experiencing — carries the same scientific import as the U.S. surgeon general’s 1964 report connecting smoking to lung cancer. "
1202,"WASHINGTON — Dana W. White, the Pentagon’s chief spokeswoman, is under investigation by the Defense Department’s inspector general over accusations that she retaliated against members of her staff after they complained about her management style, department officials said. The investigation, first reported by CNN, centers on Ms. White’s decision to transfer members of her staff after they filed complaints about her. She also used her staff to fetch dry cleaning, run other errands and drive her to work, according to the CNN report. In recent months, several Defense Department officials have complained about a toxic environment and low morale in the Pentagon’s public affairs office, and they have said that Ms. White chided department aides for talking to the news media. Officials said that Ms. White had transferred an aide who told her superiors about Ms. White’s plans to put the daughter of Adm. Craig S. Faller, the senior military assistant to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, in a top public affairs position in the office of the deputy secretary of defense. And officials pointed to a $600,000 study ordered up by Ms. White last year to look at the Defense Department’s media operations. The study has yielded little, a department official said. Bruce K. Anderson, a spokesman for the Pentagon’s inspector general, would not confirm the investigation into Ms. White. Ms. White, who is with Mr. Mattis in Argentina, referred requests for comment to a statement from one of her deputies, according to the traveling press pool. “This is an ongoing review about which we cannot comment,” said Charles Summers, the principal deputy assistant to the secretary for public affairs. Ms. White is a political appointee from the Trump administration. She previously served as a foreign policy adviser for Senator John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign and as the director of policy and strategy communications for the Renault-Nissan Alliance in France. This is not the first time Ms. White has come under scrutiny. A BuzzFeed article last month highlighted discrepancies in a series of emails between Ms. White, other Pentagon staff members and at least one reporter from Breitbart in June 2017. The emails, obtained by the watchdog group Democracy Forward and shared with BuzzFeed, show poor coordination between the White House and the Pentagon after a White House statement released June 26, 2017. The statement said that the Syrian government would “pay a heavy price” if it conducted another chemical attack. While the emails detailed in the article confirmed that the Pentagon had no knowledge of the statement and scrambled to respond, Ms. White emailed a Breitbart reporter the contrary. “DOD knew about the White House statement and provided edits in advance of its release,” Ms. White wrote. “Anonymous leaks to the contrary are false or misinformed.” "
1203,"WASHINGTON — American and European intelligence and counterterrorism officials said on Tuesday that the escalating tensions between President Trump and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey could jeopardize information sharing and law enforcement cooperation between the two countries as they fight the Islamic State in Syria. Military commanders said plans were still underway for American and Turkish troops to conduct joint patrols near Manbij, a former Islamic State hotbed in northern Syria that was liberated by Kurdish fighters. “That’ll start very soon,” Maj. Gen. Felix Gedney, the British deputy commander of the American-led coalition in Iraq and Syria, told reporters at the Pentagon. But intelligence officials conceded that the most recent strain between Turkey and the United States — over American sanctions to punish Turkey for the detention of Andrew Brunson, an evangelical pastor from North Carolina — could halt new progress against the Islamic State. A senior American intelligence official and a senior European counterterrorism official separately expressed concern that Turkey would withhold information about suspected Islamic State fighters and intelligence operations to root out extremists in Syria. Additionally, they said, Turkey might obscure missions that its security forces are conducting to prevent foreign fighters from entering Syria. Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. "
1204,"The Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago has discharged millions of gallons of warm water into the city’s iconic river without a permit, putting fish and other aquatic life there at risk, the Illinois attorney general contended in a lawsuit filed this week. In the suit, filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County on Monday, the attorney general, Lisa Madigan, alleged that even though Trump Tower’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit expired on Aug. 31, 2017, it has continued to release almost 20 million gallons of water it uses for cooling into the river each day. Additionally, the lawsuit said Trump Tower has failed to submit the results of studies that are meant to show the effect of the building’s water intake system on the Chicago River and its fish; such results should have been sent to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency in 2013, according to the attorney general’s office. Like many buildings — including several others along the Chicago River — Trump Tower uses a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system. Such systems draw in water from a source like the river, use it to cool the facility and then release the hotter wastewater back into its source. As intake systems draw in water, fish and other aquatic organisms can get sucked into the system or trapped against screens; then, when the heated effluent is discharged back into the water, the sudden change in water temperature can harm the ecosystem. Because of these environmental impacts, federal law requires extensive studies, the results of which prosecutors said Trump Tower officials had failed to submit. "
1205,"SABETHA, Kan. — A week after voters went to the polls in Kansas, Gov. Jeff Colyer conceded in the race for the Republican nomination for governor on Tuesday night, handing a razor-thin victory to Secretary of State Kris W. Kobach. Mr. Colyer had raised concerns in recent days about Mr. Kobach’s role in the vote-counting process, citing the secretary of state’s responsibility for overseeing the tallying of mail-in and provisional ballots. But speaking from the Statehouse in Topeka, Mr. Colyer said he would not challenge the results or ask for a recount. As of Tuesday night, with counties midway through tallying their provisional ballots, Mr. Kobach was leading Mr. Colyer by 345 votes out of more than 300,000 Republican ballots. “This election is probably the closest in America, but the numbers are just not there unless we were to go to extraordinary measures,” Mr. Colyer said. This primary had attracted broad interest long before election night on Aug. 7 ended with no clear winner. Though Mr. Kobach and Mr. Colyer are each staunch conservatives, the matchup gave Kansas Republicans a choice between two distinct political styles. While Mr. Colyer was viewed as a mild-mannered moderate, Mr. Kobach, endorsed by President Trump, was known widely for his strident views on illegal immigration and voter fraud. His aggressive approach prompted concerns among Republicans in Kansas and in Washington that he would be too polarizing in the general election in November, handing an opening to Democrats in a year in which they also hope to flip at least two House seats from red to blue. "
1206,"BURLINGTON, Vt. — On a cloudy afternoon this summer, Christine Hallquist, a former utility executive from Vermont, listened closely as Danica Roem, the Virginia state delegate who won national recognition when she became the first transgender person elected to her state’s Legislature, offered tips as the pair canvassed a stark residential neighborhood here. Ms. Hallquist is transgender, too, but Ms. Roem’s advice had nothing to do with gender identity. Try a light, rhythmic knock. Leave a handwritten note with campaign literature if no one is home. Try to earn every vote. “I have so much to learn,” Ms. Hallquist said, duly incorporating Ms. Roem’s lessons with each new knock. On Tuesday, those lessons paid off, and Ms. Hallquist, a Democrat, made history of her own. She became the first transgender candidate to be nominated for a governorship by a major party, beating three other candidates in Vermont’s Democratic primary, according to The Associated Press. [Read four key takeaways from Tuesday’s primaries.] “Tonight, we made history,” Ms. Hallquist said, addressing supporters at an election night party in Burlington. She added, “I am so proud to be the face of the Democrats tonight.” It is a remarkable milestone, even for an election year already dominated by an influx of women and a record number of candidates who identify as lesbian, gay, transgender or queer. "
1207,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s campaign said on Tuesday that it had filed an arbitration case against Omarosa Manigault Newman, the former campaign aide and West Wing official whose tell-all book has roiled the White House. A campaign official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the claim was filed in New York City for breach of a confidentiality agreement Ms. Manigault Newman had signed with the Trump campaign in 2016. The official did not immediately respond to questions about which court the claim was filed in. But the filing was a major escalation by Mr. Trump against Ms. Manigault Newman, whose book, “Unhinged,” is the first account by a former White House aide to make embarrassing allegations about the president and his team. Ms. Manigault Newman describes him as a racist and misogynist whose mental health is in decline. She also takes aim at his daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was a key intermediary in bringing her into the White House. Legal experts have said the nondisclosure agreements for the campaign and the White House are most likely not legally enforceable. But people close to the president said he hoped to send a warning shot that anyone else who attempts a tell-all could face legal fees, among other headaches. Mr. Trump, who values the control of information and seeks to shape his image at all times, had aides on the campaign sign nondisclosure agreements, the same type of measure he has used for employees at his private real-estate company for decades. The first section of the nondisclosure agreement says no confidential information is to be released during the term of service or anytime “thereafter.” Ms. Manigault Newman, who was the communications director for the Office of Public Liaison in the White House until being fired in December, has released tapes over several days that revealed her private conversations with Mr. Trump and other officials connected to him. That has stoked interest in the book and also called into question denials from Mr. Trump’s team. Most of her news media appearances have been on NBC, the network that vaulted her to prominence on “The Apprentice” with Mr. Trump more than a decade ago. "
1208,"HARTLAND, Wis. — Former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota was soundly defeated Tuesday in his bid to reclaim the Republican nomination for governor, a remarkable upset that demonstrated President Trump’s tightening grip on his party and the difficulty those who have criticized him in the past are facing with today’s primary voters. Mr. Pawlenty, who called Mr. Trump “unsound, uninformed, unhinged and unfit to be president” in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election, lost to Jeff Johnson, a local official and former state lawmaker who was the Republican nominee for governor in 2014, The Associated Press reported. On a night when voters in four states went to the polls, Democrats delivered groundbreaking primary victories for a transgender woman in Vermont, a Muslim woman in Minnesota and an African-American woman in Connecticut, while voters in Wisconsin nominated a top state education official, Tony Evers, to challenge Gov. Scott Walker, one of the most vulnerable high-profile Republicans of the midterms cycle. Also in Wisconsin, Republicans backed State Senator Leah Vukmir to run against Senator Tammy Baldwin, a first-term Democrat, propelling an establishment Republican who was careful to heap praise on Mr. Trump while harnessing the support of state party leaders. [Read four key takeaways from Tuesday’s primaries.] As in other Republican races this year, the Senate primary here between Ms. Vukmir and Kevin Nicholson, a former marine and a political newcomer, turned into a contest between candidates determined to defend and prove their devotion to the president. Something similar took place in neighboring Minnesota, too, but Mr. Pawlenty had a harder time proving his fealty to a polarizing president. "
1209,"Six years after Austin Tice, a journalist and Marine veteran, was abducted while reporting on the war in Syria, his parents expressed confidence on Tuesday that he was alive. The parents, Marc and Debra Tice, spent the anniversary of Mr. Tice’s disappearance publicizing efforts to free their son, 37, who they believe remains a captive somewhere in Syria, entangled in the war. “It seems like, in many ways, the time has gone so quickly, but we know that, for Austin, it must be grinding on,” his mother said in an interview on NBC’s “Today.” Asked what keeps them optimistic, his father said, “Well, we know he’s alive, and we’re sure he wants to come home.” They also released a video about his abduction, “Now Is the Time to Free Austin Tice,” which emphasized the historic events over the past six years that their son had missed. He has come to symbolize the lethal hazards for news workers covering the war in Syria, where dozens have been abducted. At least five other journalists remain missing in Syria and 122 have been killed since the conflict began in 2011, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an advocacy group. Mr. Tice was attending Georgetown Law School in 2012 when he decided to go to Syria as a freelance journalist to report on the war through its impact on ordinary Syrians, filing articles for McClatchy, The Washington Post and other news organizations. He was detained at a checkpoint on Aug. 14, 2012, near Damascus, days before he planned to depart the country. "
1210,"The remark was music to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s ears. Dan Donovan, who was running for New York attorney general in 2010, said that he did not plan to be known as the “Sheriff of Wall Street,” a sobriquet that Eliot Spitzer earned when he occupied the office. “What do you mean you don’t want to be the Sheriff of Wall Street?” Mr. Cuomo said during a November 2010 rally. “The job description is, you’re the Sheriff of Wall Street. If you don’t want the job, don’t run for the job.” That sentiment could come back to haunt Mr. Cuomo’s preferred candidate for the Democratic nomination for attorney general, Letitia James. Ms. James, the New York City public advocate, said to The New York Times that it was “critically important” that she “not be known as the ‘Sheriff on Wall Street.’” Her remark drew immediate criticism from her Democratic opponents. [Ms. James has also been criticized for her allegiance to Gov. Cuomo, although those ties have also paid broad dividends. Read more here.] Zephyr Teachout, a Fordham Law professor, said on Twitter that she “can’t wait to be known as the Sheriff of Wall Street, the Nightwatchwoman, the Avenger: you name it.” "
1211,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Trade war troubles for China, a blow to the #MeToo movement in South Korea, and black market avocados in New Zealand. Here’s what you need to know: • Uneasy in Beijing. Friction with the Trump administration and troubles at home appear to have dented President Xi Jinping’s political dominance. With stocks slumping and the currency dropping, censors have been deleting a torrent of criticism online, some of it directed at Mr. Xi. If the trade war with the U.S. escalates, our correspondents report, there are worries that the Chinese public’s faith in the economy could be shaken, exposing the nation to much more serious problems than a drop in exports. The leadership can still divert criticism by blaming the U.S., though so far, it has not ratcheted up anti-American propaganda beyond the usual volume. In contrast, as Turkey braces for more financial turmoil, its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, called for a boycott of U.S. goods (including, notably, the iPhone). "
1212,"WASHINGTON — When President Trump signed a $716 billion military spending bill on Monday, he claimed the authority to override dozens of provisions that he deemed improper constraints on his executive powers. In a signing statement that the White House quietly issued after 9 p.m. on Monday — about six hours after Mr. Trump signed the bill in a televised ceremony at Fort Drum in New York — Mr. Trump deemed about 50 of its statutes to be unconstitutional intrusions on his presidential powers, meaning that the executive branch need not enforce or obey them as written. Among them was a ban on spending military funds on “any activity that recognizes the sovereignty of the Russian Federation over Crimea,” the Ukrainian region annexed by Moscow in 2014 in an incursion considered illegal by the United States. He said he would treat the provision and similar ones as “consistent with the president’s exclusive constitutional authorities as commander in chief and as the sole representative of the nation in foreign affairs.” The statement was the latest example of Mr. Trump’s emerging broad vision of executive power. His personal lawyers, for example, have claimed that his constitutional authority to supervise the Justice Department means that he can lawfully impede the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election no matter his motive, despite obstruction-of-justice statutes. Signing statements, which are generally ghostwritten for presidents by Justice Department and White House lawyers, are official documents in which a president lays out his interpretation of new laws and instructs the executive branch to view them the same way. Once obscure, the practice became controversial under President George W. Bush, who challenged more provisions of new laws than all previous presidents combined — most famously a 2005 ban on torture championed by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. (Democrats are pressing for access to any White House papers of Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett M. Kavanaugh, related to that statement.) "
1213,"One of the stranger subplots in the story of the Russia investigation has been that of Peter Strzok, formerly a senior counterintelligence agent.  When his text messages critical of President Trump were revealed in the summer of 2017, he rocketed into the public eye. As of this week, that subplot is complete: On Monday, Mr. Strzok was fired from the F.B.I. Mr. Strzok helped lead the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server and played a role in the probe into ties between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence. But Robert Mueller, the special counsel, dismissed him from the Trump-Russia investigation over concern that his text messages — exchanged on F.B.I. phones with a colleague, Lisa Page, with whom Mr. Strzok was having an affair — would create the appearance of bias. In the year since Mr. Strzok’s indiscretion became public, he has proved a useful punching bag for the president and his allies in both Congress and the media. According to Mr. Trump’s Twitter feed, Mr. Strzok is “incompetent and corrupt” and a “sick loser” — a man at the epicenter of a vast conspiracy to cook up a bogus “witch hunt” against the president. As with everything about Mr. Strzok’s public role over the last year, it’s hard to know what to make of his firing. Mr. Strzok’s texts with Ms. Page were indefensible. (The Justice Department inspector general wrote that the two displayed “extremely poor judgment and a gross lack of professionalism.”)  But the F.B.I.’s Office of Professional Responsibility recommended that he be demoted and suspended for 60 days — not fired. His dismissal instead came at the direction of the F.B.I. deputy director, David Bowdich, who overruled the formal recommendation. As my Lawfare colleague Susan Hennessey wrote, Mr. Bowdich’s highly unusual intervention raises the “specter of politically motivated retaliation” against Mr. Strzok. The president, of course, can’t help himself. Within an hour of Mr. Strzok’s firing, he took to Twitter, crowing over the defeat of his latest whipping boy and hinting that the Russia probe should be tossed along with Mr. Strzok. This, ultimately, is the core of the smallness and viciousness of the Strzok affair. His dismissal will not make the Russia investigation go away. At the end of the day, he was thrown into the grist mill of pro-Trump media and chewed to pieces by Fox News and House Republicans for a few months’ worth of cynical, lucrative outrage. "

1215,"BEIJING — China’s leaders have sought to project confidence in the face of President Trump’s tariffs and trade threats. But as it becomes clear that a protracted trade war with the United States may be unavoidable, there are growing signs of unease inside the Communist political establishment. In recent days, officials from the Commerce Ministry, the police and other agencies have summoned exporters to ask about plans to lay off workers or shift supply chains to other countries. With stocks slumping and the currency dropping 9 percent against the dollar since mid-April, censors have been deleting a torrent of criticism online, some of it directed at President Xi Jinping’s leadership. State news outlets, by contrast, have sought to promote the official line, with the authorities restricting the use of the phrase “trade war.” Still, policy disputes over how to bolster the economy have at times spilled into the open, with the state media sometimes coming under attack for boasting about China’s economic strengths.

1216,"The problem with being Donald Trump isn’t just being Donald Trump. It’s all the other, lesser Trumps around you. It’s the versions of yourself that you create, the echoes of yourself that you inspire. They’ll devour you in the end. I don’t mean his biological offspring, though they’re no picnic. I mean his spiritual spawn. I mean the knaves, nuts, schemers and dreamers who have taken their cues from him or turned his lessons against him. This is their moment. This is their month. Omarosa Manigault Newman has a Trump-savaging book, “Unhinged,” out this week, and while she’s a compromised messenger, she’s also a mesmerizing one. From the master she learned how to draw and hold the spotlight: Mete out revelations. Hurl accusations. Contradict yourself. Leave everyone gasping, gawking and coming back for more. “Trump and Omarosa Are Kindred Spirits” reads the headline on a new Bloomberg column by Tim O’Brien, the author of the 2005 book “TrumpNation.” The president, he notes, was “fascinated by her self-absorption and nastiness.” Trump stares into every mirror he passes. “She may be the purest of all the Trump characters,” an unnamed former Trump administration official told Axios’s Jonathan Swan. “She may be the most Trumpian.” No maybe about it. She made secret tapes, just like Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer. No one should be surprised, least of all Trump. When you grease the walls of your sanctum with lies and put fun-house mirrors everywhere, is it any wonder that the dazed people inside try to protect themselves with a lifeline like proof? "
1217,"WASHINGTON — President Trump added his former White House aide, Omarosa Manigault Newman, on Tuesday to the growing list of African-Americans he has publicly denigrated on Twitter, calling her “that dog” and a “crazed, crying lowlife” after her allegations against him of mental deterioration and racism. Even for a president who consistently uses Twitter to assail his adversaries, the morning tweet about Ms. Manigault Newman was a remarkably crude use of the presidential bully pulpit to disparage a woman who once served at the highest levels in his White House. In an interview on MSNBC, Ms. Manigault Newman responded that Mr. Trump treats women differently from men because he “believes they are beneath him” and that he talked in derogatory ways about minorities. “He has absolutely no respect for women, for African-Americans,” she said. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has called Don Lemon, a CNN anchor, “the dumbest man on television.” He has questioned the intelligence of LeBron James, a star basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers. And he has repeatedly said that Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, has a “low I.Q.” Mr. Trump has also deployed the “dog” insult for white people, including Arianna Huffington, a founder of HuffPost. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump tweeted that a onetime political rival and fellow Republican, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, “lies like a dog.” Tuesday morning’s tweet was the latest in what has become an increasingly personal and malicious stream of Twitter posts from Mr. Trump, many of which are responses to his critics or aimed at questioning the integrity of the continuing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether Mr. Trump or his aides were complicit in it. In recent days, the president has again used Twitter to lash out at his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and at an F.B.I. agent who helped oversee the Russia investigation and who was fired for sending texts critical of Mr. Trump. "
1218,"WASHINGTON — Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, in a speech last year, gave a strong hint at his views on taxpayer support for religious schools when he praised his “first judicial hero,” Justice William Rehnquist, for determining that the strict wall between church and state “was wrong as a matter of law and history.” Mr. Rehnquist’s legacy on religious issues was most profound in “ensuring that religious schools and religious institutions could participate as equals in society and in state benefits programs,” Judge Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee to succeed Justice Anthony M. Kennedy on the Supreme Court, declared at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization. Words like that from a Supreme Court nominee are breathing new life into the debate over public funding for sectarian education. Educators see him as crucial to answering a question left by Justice Kennedy after the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional for the state of Missouri to exclude a church-based preschool from competing for public funding to upgrade its playground: Can a church-school playground pave the way for taxpayer funding to flow to private and parochial schools for almost any purpose? Over his decades-long legal career, Judge Kavanaugh has argued in favor of breaking down barriers between church and state. He has filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of school prayer and the right of religious groups to gain access to public school facilities. He was part of the legal team that represented former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida in 2000 when he defended a school voucher program that was later ruled unconstitutional. The program had used public funds to help pay the tuition of students leaving some of the state’s lowest-performing schools for private or religious schools. School voucher champions see Judge Kavanaugh as a critical vote in overturning longstanding constitutional prohibitions, often called Blaine Amendments, that outlaw government funding of religious institutions in more than three dozen states. The amendments have been used to challenge programs that allow taxpayer funding to follow children to private and parochial schools, and are seen as the last line of defense against widespread acceptance of school voucher programs. Last June, private and parochial school advocates expressed cautious optimism that the Supreme Court decision on allowing public funding to resurface a church-school playground, Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, would begin to weaken the prohibitions against using taxpayer funds to cover tuition at parochial schools. "
1219,"To the Editor: Re “A Bill Honors McCain, and Trump Snubs Him” (news article, Aug. 14): President Trump’s refusal to mention John McCain’s name as he was pontificating about the new military spending bill for 28 minutes reveals the inner Trump in a stark way. His inability to mention the senator’s name is a sign of his immaturity, insecurity, fear of competition, vindictiveness and delusional sense of self-importance. He is the quintessential petulant child. Debasing a war hero comes easy to him. Taking credit for a bill bearing Mr. McCain’s name also comes easy to him. He has no moral compass.

In Mr. Strzok’s case, the firing was against the judgment of the bureau’s own Office of Professional Responsibility. One wonders, given the targeting of these dedicated public servants, patriots all: Who exactly are the real witch hunters? Victoria Pousette-Dart
Stamford, Conn. To the Editor: The Republicans in Congress have reacted to the Peter Strzok texts criticizing President Trump as if F.B.I. agents take an oath never to vote for a Democrat. I’m sure that if anyone did an objective study of historical political bias at the F.B.I., we would see that the personal political leanings of F.B.I. agents have been overwhelming conservative. Putting personal political beliefs aside when conducting an investigation is standard practice among law enforcement professionals. Mr. Strzok showed poor judgment perhaps, but he did not give up his right to have political opinions when he took his oath as an F.B.I. employee. Bruce White
St. Paul To the Editor: The firing of Peter Strzok for trashing President Trump in text messages reveals a secret world of partisan politics, preferential treatment and tomfoolery within an agency that is supposed to be fearlessly independent. The F.B.I. has had a dismal record of obeying the law when it comes to domestic spying and is too willing to get involved in political shenanigans. More important, mixing intelligence gathering, espionage and counterterrorism with political corruption is inherently problematic. Creating a permanent independent special prosecutor’s office staffed with lawyers and investigators recruited from state and local agencies without Beltway ties will lend transparency and integrity to investigations during these ethically difficult times.

He threatened her with consequences to get her to resign rather than be terminated by the government.

On Tuesday, however, I had a smile on my face as I read several articles that gave me hope that perhaps America has not completely lost its collective mind. First I read about the disarray in the white supremacist movement. Other articles alerted me to criticism of Representative Robert Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia, and Stephen Miller, a White House aide, from their son and uncle, respectively, concerning their partisan actions and positions. Another article informed me that Pinellas County, Florida, had decided to charge a gun-toting driver with manslaughter in an incident that began with an argument about a parking space and resulted in the shooting death of a man. The shooter had attempted to hide behind the state’s Stand Your Ground law. All this good news, and I am only on Page A20! Bill Gottdenker

1222,"WASHINGTON — As we bear witness to the global democratic recession, we cannot afford to ignore the increasing militarization of societies in Latin America, which has coincided with illiberal trends in other parts of the world. After President Trump’s ill-advised suggestion to use the United States military to secure our southern border, the administration has an opening this week to demonstrate commitment to our core principles by stating its opposition to the militarization of law enforcement, which represents a challenge to liberal democracy across much of Latin America. As James Mattis embarks on his first trip to South America as secretary of defense, he has the opportunity to declare United States support for police and judicial reform as the best method to fight crime and violence. It is the perfect time to highlight the dangers of militarization; three of the four countries on the secretary’s itinerary — Brazil, Argentina and Colombia — have to varying degrees turned to their armed forces for domestic security. Unfortunately, as we’ve seen in Mexico, reliance on the military jeopardizes the protection of human rights and can actually exacerbate citizen insecurity. Secretary Mattis will begin his trip in the Southern Cone before traveling to Colombia. Given the military’s participation in past repression in Brazil and Argentina during the dictatorships of the Cold War, the deployment of the armed forces to supplement and sometimes even supplant the police is particularly alarming. Military operations in the favelas of Brazil have become commonplace, and the Brazilian Army is currently in charge of Rio de Janeiro’s police force. The front-runner among eligible candidates for Brazil’s October presidential election, the retired Army Capt. Jair Bolsonaro, would most likely increase the use of troops to fight crime. After all, he has suggested that security forces should have greater impunity to shoot criminals, and he has expressed nostalgia for Brazil’s 21-year military dictatorship, which he has called “a time of glory.” Concurrently, Argentina is taking the first steps down the path toward reliance on the military for internal security. Last month, President Mauricio Macri announced the deployment of troops to the northern border region to work alongside the police to counter illicit trafficking. And in the case of post-peace-accord Colombia, President Iván Duque will continue to rely on the armed forces in the ongoing struggle against criminal bands, the National Liberation Army and former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia members who have refused to disarm. The logic behind the decision to use the military is that the underfunded and often corrupt police have failed to ameliorate a situation of extreme citizen insecurity. Latin America accounts for 8 percent of the world population but 33 percent of global homicides. The homicide rate in Latin America is 21.5 per 100,000 citizens, which is over three times the global average of eight. Brazil’s homicide rate reached a record high last year at 31 per 100,000, and Colombia has a rate of 27 per 100,000. Although Argentina has a much lower homicide rate of fewer than seven per 100,000, 27 percent of Argentines report being victim of a crime in the past year. Not surprising, Brazil and Colombia also have high victimization rates at 24 percent and 25 percent. The need for security is urgent and undeniable, but the Mexican case illustrates that the military is not the solution. Since 2006, when President Felipe Calderón summoned the armed forces to lead the struggle against violent criminal organizations, violence and crime have increased dramatically. Last year the homicide rate reached 25 per 100,000, the highest rate since the Mexican government began keeping track. A staggering 48 percent of Mexicans feel unsafe in their neighborhoods, and 19 percent feel that they must move because of fear of crime. "
1223,"ALEXANDRIA, Va. — Paul Manafort’s lawyers declined Tuesday to call any witnesses to defend him against charges of bank and tax fraud. Mr. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, also told the judge that he did not want to testify, clearing the way for closing arguments from both sides and the start of jury deliberations on Wednesday. The decision by the defense to rest without presenting its own evidence was not unusual. “The defense believes it has made its point through cross-examination,” said Nancy Gertner, a Harvard Law School professor and a former federal judge. Mr. Manafort is letting the case go to the jury because he and his lawyers “do not believe that the government has met its burden of proof,” said Kevin Downing, the lead defense lawyer in the case. Earlier on Tuesday, Judge T. S. Ellis III of the United States District Court in Alexandria also denied a motion by Mr. Manafort’s lawyers to acquit him on all 18 charges without giving the case to the jury, another standard defense tactic as trials wind down. He closed the courtroom for more than two hours to discuss another defense motion that has been sealed, along with the government’s response. Prosecutors for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, rested their case Monday after calling roughly two dozen witnesses and introducing hundreds of exhibits. Mr. Manafort, 69, is accused of evading taxes on roughly $16.5 million in income that he earned working for pro-Russia political forces in Ukraine. When that income ran out, prosecutors claim, he fraudulently obtained more than $20 million in bank loans so he could maintain an extravagant lifestyle. Defense lawyers made a special effort, including submitting a last-minute brief, to persuade the judge to throw out four bank fraud charges involving $16 million in loans that Mr. Manafort obtained from a small Chicago bank in late 2016 and early 2017. Richard Westling, one of Mr. Manafort’s lawyers, argued that the bank, Federal Savings Bank, was not defrauded because its chairman, Stephen M. Calk, was determined to do business with Mr. Manafort, despite questions about Mr. Manafort’s wherewithal. He also argued that bank officials were well aware of Mr. Manafort’s true financial situation. "
1224,"WASHINGTON — A low-profile Republican congressman from northeast Ohio has gone where few in his party have dared this campaign season: He has bragged to his constituents that he has stood up to President Trump. In an election year when many Republicans have slavishly courted the president’s validation and endorsement, and others have been reluctant, even afraid, to criticize him, Representative David Joyce has gingerly risked Trumpian wrath. “I’ll do what’s right for northeastern Ohio even if it means standing up to my own party,” Mr. Joyce said in an advertisement. Then another message appears on the screen: “Dave Joyce Stood Up to President Trump.” His defiance was not all that drastic: The congressman said he moved to protect Lake Erie and the federal Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which the Trump administration had tried to kill. The ad is nowhere to be found on his website or on YouTube. His Democratic opponent, Betsy Rader, was unimpressed. “He’s running away from his record,” she said. “I believe that he’s voted with Trump 96.7 percent of the time. And I actually decided to run for Congress because of his commitment to repeal the Affordable Care Act.” “This has been his history in Congress,” she said. “He’s talked out of both sides of his mouth. Now he’s trying to flip.” "
1225,"WASHINGTON — President Trump revoked the security clearance of John O. Brennan, the former C.I.A. director under President Barack Obama, on Wednesday in a striking act of retaliation against an outspoken critic. The president threatened to do the same to other former national security officials who have antagonized him. Citing what he called Mr. Brennan’s “erratic” behavior and “increasingly frenzied commentary,” Mr. Trump dispatched Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his press secretary, to read a statement saying that Mr. Brennan had abused his access to the United States’ secrets “to make a series of unfounded and outrageous allegations.” The statement came only a few weeks after Ms. Sanders warned that Mr. Trump was considering revoking the clearances of Mr. Brennan and others who he believed had politicized and inappropriately profited from their access to delicate information. It was the latest assault by a president who has routinely questioned the loyalties of national security officials and dismissed some of their findings — particularly the conclusion that Moscow intervened in the 2016 election — as attacks against him. [In Opinion, the former C.I.A. chief John Brennan pushes back at President Trump: “Mr. Trump’s claims of no collusion are, in a word, hogwash.”] Step by step, from the moment 10 days into his administration that he fired the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, Mr. Trump has overseen the removal of top national security officials who have defied him or worked at senior levels of the Russia investigation. They include James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director; Andrew G. McCabe, the former F.B.I. deputy director; and Peter Strzok, the former F.B.I. counterintelligence agent who helped oversee the Hillary Clinton email inquiry and the Russia investigation and disparaged Mr. Trump in a series of inflammatory texts. Mr. Trump’s action against Mr. Brennan appeared to be the first time that a president has ever issued or revoked a clearance outside of the established process, according to Bradley P. Moss, a lawyer who has written on the issue. "

1227,"Christine Hallquist, the former chief executive of an electric utility company, made history on Tuesday when she beat three other candidates in Vermont’s Democratic primary to become the first transgender person to be nominated for a governorship by a major party. Ms. Hallquist, 62, was well-known in Vermont before she ran for office, in part because of her gender transition in 2015, which happened while she ran the Vermont Electric Cooperative and which was featured in a documentary film made by her son. She will now compete in November against the incumbent, Phil Scott, a Republican with solid but softening approval ratings who has governed one of the country’s most deeply progressive states since 2016. Ms. Hallquist spoke to The New York Times about the historic nature of her victory, her plan to improve internet access in rural America, and how she thinks humans can beat back climate change.

1228,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo mocked President Trump’s ubiquitous “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan on Wednesday, quickly drawing the ire of Republicans from New York to the White House for saying that America “was never that great.” “We are not going to make America great again. It was never that great,” Mr. Cuomo said. “We have not reached greatness. We will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged.” Mr. Cuomo made the comment at the end of a 20-minute speech that focused heavily on Mr. Trump. The event was ostensibly a bill-signing ceremony for new penalties for sex trafficking in New York. The clip was quickly packaged by Republicans, and Marcus Molinaro, the Republican candidate for governor, said that Mr. Cuomo owed the nation an apology. “America, with its imperfections, has always been great,” Mr. Molinaro said. By late Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump himself waded in, repeating Mr. Cuomo’s “never that great” quote, in all-capital letters, and adding, “Can you believe this is the Governor of the Highest Taxed State in the U.S., Andrew Cuomo, having a total meltdown!” Mr. Trump had traveled to New York on Monday and mocked the possibility that Mr. Cuomo might run for president in 2020, saying the governor had privately told him he wouldn’t run against him. “Oh, please do it,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Cuomo’s office did not immediately respond to that allegation but the next day the governor said, “I don’t have any personal political conversations” with the president. In his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo, who is facing a primary challenge from his Democratic rival, Cynthia Nixon, explained that he saw Mr. Trump’s slogan as backward looking. “He has it on his hat: ‘Make America Great Again.’ What does that mean? We’re going to go back to a time when America was great. Right? ‘Great again.’ The whole concept is, it’s retrospective,” Mr. Cuomo said. “When do you want to go back to, Mr. President? What was the great time that you want to take us back to, when America was great?” Mr. Cuomo went on to suggest that Mr. Trump wanted to return to a time before gay marriage and the women’s equality and environmental protection movements and “before these new immigrants started to come across the border.” “That’s when America was great, in his head,” Mr. Cuomo told the crowd in Manhattan. A few hours later, after the backlash, the governor’s press secretary, Dani Lever, issued a statement. “The governor believes America is great,” Ms. Lever clarified, adding that “maximum greatness” was still to be achieved. The governor’s dislike of “retrospective” slogans is relatively new. When he ran for governor in 2010, Mr. Cuomo said in his announcement video, “Together, we can make New York great again.” "

1230,"BRUSSELS — From the start of the torturous negotiations over Brexit, as Britain’s exit from the European Union is known, the talks have followed an all too familiar dynamic. The Europeans set the agenda; the British push for concessions or special deals, while trying to work out among themselves what they really want. The Europeans say no, sticking to a pretty hard line. But now, with 85 percent of a deal completed, and the toughest issues remaining, European officials say they are increasingly worried that Prime Minister Theresa May’s government is so divided and fragile that it could collapse, scuttling a deal and inflicting damage on the Continental economy. So the Europeans are now exploring ways to finesse their position, three senior European officials say, to sign a withdrawal agreement by the end of the year so it can be ratified by the end of March, when Brexit occurs regardless. That would formally divorce Britain from the bloc after more than 40 years of marriage. But some of the hardest issues would be left for transition talks that will last another 19 months, until the end of 2020. All of the officials spoke anonymously, following diplomatic practice, and because they do not have permission to be quoted by name. "
1231,"Last week, Ben Shapiro, the right-wing pundit, elicited outrage on his behalf from conservatives when he asked the Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to debate him and she said that she did not owe a response “to unsolicited requests from men with bad intentions.” Mr. Shapiro had offered an hour of his time, $10,000 that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez could keep for her campaign or give to charity, and the opportunity, as he put it in a taped request, to make “America a more civil and interesting place.” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her admirers doubted the sincerity of someone who on his website, The Daily Wire, once posted a video cartoon characterizing Native Americans as murderous savages until Christopher Columbus arrived to enlighten them. (He later apologized.) Mr. Shapiro and his followers saw in her refusal further proof of the left’s antipathy to engaging with ideological difference. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, of course, is under no obligation to debate someone who is not running for anything. She does find herself, however, in the comparatively unusual position of igniting the interests of men who want to argue with her, whatever their motives. It has not always been this way. When a victory over Joseph Crowley, the 10-term congressman she challenged in the Democratic primary seemed so improbable, he did not rush to join her on stage and argue about housing policy. The two candidates debated twice; on two other occasions Mr. Crowley said he could not attend because of scheduling conflicts, and on one of those he sent a surrogate, Annabel Palma, a former City Councilwoman, which left the impression that the girls ought to just work things out among themselves. Feminism’s grand resurgence this past year — striking in the results of the Democratic primary in Minnesota’s Fifth Congressional District on Tuesday in which Ilhan Omar, a young Somali immigrant, won in a six-way race that had three male candidates cumulatively receiving less than 9 percent of the vote — seems to have had little effect on heightening the sensitivities of male politicians to the optics of dismissing their female opponents. When women in politics are not facing the tediousness of having men explain things to them, they are often up against the indignities of their apathy. "
1232,"I am beginning to worry that when I die, the highlight of my obituary will be that I was once called “a dog” by Donald Trump. Hey, it was long ago, but it still comes up. Particularly now that we’re making lists of all the women our president has ever compared to a canine. Back when I worked for New York Newsday, he sent me a copy of a column I’d written, scrawled with objections, along with an announcement that I was “a dog and a liar” and that my picture was “the face of a pig.” At the time, he was only a flailing real estate developer trying to make a deal with the city, yet it still seemed so weird that at first I wondered if it might be a joke, or some enemy of Trump’s trying to embarrass him. But no, it was a missive from the man himself. This week, of course, Trump referred to his ex-friend Omarosa in a tweet as “that dog.” I am going to go out on a limb and say that when the president of the United States insults a woman that way in a public statement, it’s a little bit more of an issue. The blowback was enormous. So intense that the president tried to change the subject by revoking the security clearance of ex-C.I.A. director John Brennan, a frequent critic. And warning that he was considering doing the same to other former officials. All of whom, coincidentally, also seemed to be frequent critics. One of the worst things about this moment in our national lives is the fear that if Trump gets into trouble for doing something dumb and obnoxious, he’ll respond by doing something huge and maybe dangerous. Have you heard that Stormy Daniels is going to be on the British version of “Celebrity Big Brother”? What happens if she tells that story about a hotel room spanking session to a house full of smirking Europeans? He could declare a war. Lately, everything seems to start with reality TV. You’ll remember that Omarosa appeared on a U.S. version of “Big Brother” and dished the dirt on her former boss. “The bad tweets happen between 4 and 6 in the morning,” she confided to a fellow contestant. “Ain’t nobody up there but Melania.” But this was pretty small potatoes compared to what Stormy might come up with. (Plus, people, do we really think Melania was up there?) "
1233,"DAHYAN, Yemen — The boys crammed into the bus, their thin bodies packed three to a seat, with latecomers jammed in the aisle. They fidgeted with excitement about the day’s field trip, talking so loudly that a tall boy struggling to get their attention put his hands over his ears and yelled. Hours later, most of them were dead. During a stop for snacks in the poor village of Dahyan in northern Yemen, an airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition of Arab nations hit nearby, blasting the bus into a jagged mass of twisted metal and scattering its human cargo — wounded, bleeding and dead — in the street below, according to witnesses and parents. “My leg is bent,” cried a young boy covered in blood, examining his damaged limb. “A jet hit us,” he said in a video taken at the scene after the airstrike. Yemeni health officials said 54 people were killed, 44 of them children, and many more were wounded. Yemen’s conflict began in 2014 when Houthi rebels, who are aligned with Iran, seized control of the capital, Sana, and sent the government into exile. In March 2015, Saudi Arabia — Iran’s chief rival for power and influence in the Middle East — formed a coalition of Arab nations and launched a military intervention aimed at restoring Yemen’s government. It has so far failed to do so. The Aug. 9 attack was particularly shocking, even for a war in which children have been the primary victims, suffering through one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, with rampant malnutrition and outbreaks of cholera. The war had killed more than 10,000 people before the United Nations stopped updating the death toll two years ago. "
1234,"What He Said President Trump defended his trade policies on Wednesday, ambiguously claiming on Twitter that the United States was “built on Tariffs.” This is not a new position for Mr. Trump. Since the 2016 campaign, he has promoted tariffs as the best way to counter trade imbalances with foreign countries — especially China. This year, he has imposed sweeping tariffs on steel, aluminum and $34 billion worth of Chinese products, prompting retaliatory taxes on the United States. Most recently, Mr. Trump announced last week that he would double the rate of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Turkey, which is in the midst of an economic crisis. The Facts Although it is unclear what era in United States history Mr. Trump was referring to, it was most likely the period starting in the late 19th century, from after the Civil War to before World War I, said Douglas A. Irwin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College. During this period, the country maintained high taxes on imports that effectively blocked manufactured goods from foreign countries, Professor Irwin said. At the same time, the United States had high levels of economic growth and industrialization. "
1235,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The White House has stripped the security clearance of John Brennan, above, the former C.I.A. chief and a vocal critic of President Trump. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, indicated that the reason was that he is among a group of former officials who have “transitioned into highly partisan” people. And closing arguments in the bank and tax fraud trial of Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, began today, with prosecutors calling the evidence against him “overwhelming.” Separately, newspapers across the U.S. are publishing editorials rejecting Mr. Trump’s repeated verbal attacks on the news media. Here is The Times’s essay. _____ "
1236,"WASHINGTON — Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, is forming a group to try to sell voters on a midterm message that they should support Republicans to defend the Trump agenda and save the president from impeachment. The group, Citizens of the American Republic, is Mr. Bannon’s new vehicle after he was pushed out of the White House last summer and then parted ways with the conservative website Breitbart. Mr. Bannon declined to describe his donors or how much money the group has raised. One person close to the group said that Rebekah Mercer, the hedge fund billionaire who supported Mr. Bannon’s previous political efforts but broke ties with him months ago, has no role. Most of Mr. Trump’s advisers in the White House consider Mr. Bannon’s foray into the midterms to be quixotic — they say the House is almost certainly lost to the Democrats — and see his efforts as another way to promote himself. They point to Mr. Bannon’s paltry record in backing Republican candidates, particularly Roy S. Moore, the Alabama Senate hopeful who was accused of sexual misconduct against several women, including a teenager, and lost last year to a Democrat. But Mr. Bannon, who insists that approaching congressional races as one-offs is a waste of time, is planning a messaging push on cable television, the op-ed pages of newspapers and local conservative radio shows. His premise is that more of Mr. Trump will be a good thing. “More than any other midterm, this is a referendum on his style and on his content, and you cannot run from that; you have to embrace it,” Mr. Bannon said in an interview. "
1237,"ALEXANDRIA, Va. — The evidence against Paul Manafort is “overwhelming,” a prosecutor told jurors during closing arguments in his fraud trial on Thursday, saying that he hid more than $16 million in income and fraudulently obtained $20 million in bank loans even though, as a trained lawyer, “Mr. Manafort knew the law.” But in a response that drew prosecutors’ ire, lawyers for Mr. Manafort, once President Trump’s campaign chairman, hinted that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, had charged Mr. Manafort to pressure him into cooperating with the inquiry into Russian influence over the 2016 presidential race. On the final day of the trial, the lead prosecutor, Greg D. Andres, cast Mr. Manafort as a bright and highly capable political consultant, steeped in tax law and financial matters and fluent in terms like “write-offs” and “distribution” income. “It wasn’t a clerical decision. It wasn’t ‘forgot to check a box,’” Mr. Andres said. “When you follow the trail of Mr. Manafort’s finances, it is littered with lies.” Over 12 days in court, the prosecution called 27 witnesses and offered 388 photographs, emails and other documents as evidence of a scheme by Mr. Manafort to finance a life of opulence through sustained and sprawling fraud. But in their closing statement, Mr. Manafort’s lawyers implied that the real issue was why he was in the courtroom to begin with. Only after the special counsel took an interest in him, they argued, did bank executives and accountants begin to raise questions about irregularities in his financial records, tax returns or loan applications. Investigators for the special counsel were “going through each piece of paper and finding anything that doesn’t match up to add to the weight of evidence against Mr. Manafort,” said Richard Westling, one of Mr. Manafort’s lawyers. Mr. Manafort was even charged, he said, with fraudulent statements in an application for a loan that was never granted. "
1238,"WASHINGTON — When the White House announced on Wednesday that President Trump was revoking or reviewing the security clearances of former officials who have emerged as some of his chief political antagonists, the list also included a little-known career Justice Department official, Bruce Ohr. Mr. Ohr has found himself at the center of a right-wing conspiracy theory about the origins of the investigation into Russia’s 2016 election interference. A lawyer who worked on anti-gang and anti-drug initiatives, he has no direct involvement in the inquiry, but losing his clearance could affect his ability to do his job. Mr. Ohr’s name came at the end of a list of former officials whom Mr. Trump accused of leveraging their access to sensitive information for personal gain. “Such access is particularly inappropriate when former officials have transitioned into highly partisan positions and seek to use real or perceived access to sensitive information to validate their political attacks,” Mr. Trump said in a statement read at the daily White House briefing by his press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. She also announced that John O. Brennan, the former C.I.A. director, was losing his clearance altogether. Asked why Mr. Ohr was named when he is still a government employee and whether that meant Mr. Trump believed he should be fired, Ms. Sanders only repeated that his clearance was under review. Democrats and others attacked his inclusion on the list as an abuse of presidential power and an intrusion on the independence of law enforcement. "
1239,"RE: LOSING EARTH Nathaniel Rich wrote about the decade we almost stopped climate change. Although we admire James Hansen and Rafe Pomerance’s important work, focusing on only a few white, male climate advocates based in the United States during a particular time decades ago is simplistic. It’s disrespectful to the thousands of others who have made this fight their life’s work and implies that these men were our best, and last, shot at saving humanity. We must acknowledge and join forces with indigenous leaders, communities of color, women and young people in the United States and throughout the world who have led the climate-justice movement for decades. To ignore this diverse coalition’s extraordinary contributions is to also ignore the enormous victories they have achieved time and again against big polluters. These successes draw hope from our past and propel us in our present to help write a more just, viable future. Patti Lynn, executive director of Corporate Accountability; Lidy Nacpil, coordinator of Asian Peoples’ Movement on Debt and Development in the Philippines; and May Boeve, executive director of 350 Long before everyone was talking about climate change, Rafe Pomerance and Friends of the Earth were on the front lines, holding fossil-fuel corporations to account and pushing politicians to act. And we’ve been doing it ever since. The hostility we faced then has only increased. Decades of corporate and political lies about climate change have weakened policies intended to protect people and the planet. For years, Republicans have obstructed progress on this issue, and Democrats — even those who acknowledged the problem long ago — have failed to lead with bold action for fear of political retribution. To solve this crisis, we must dismantle the political and corporate systems that destroy our planet. We must halt the extraction and burning of fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy that prioritizes the most affected communities. The power to achieve these goals lies with people. Only a mass movement of people, built from the ground up, can take on the corporations and politicians who endanger people and the planet for profit. This is how we win. Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth "
1240,"BOSTON — In one of the last Democratic congressional primaries where a woman of color is hoping to unseat a white male incumbent, the challenger used their final debate on Wednesday to aggressively question her opponent’s commitment to party principles. Ayanna Pressley, a Boston city councilor, is facing off against Representative Michael E. Capuano in Massachusetts’s Seventh Congressional District, challenging the 10-term congressman in what some see as a proxy fight for the future of the party. In a half-hour back-and-forth on WGBH-TV’s “Greater Boston,” with no studio audience to distract them, Ms. Pressley questioned Mr. Capuano’s commitment to abortion rights, stopping President Trump’s proposed border wall and pushing for gun control. The two also disagreed over whether N.F.L. players should take a knee during the national anthem. Mr. Capuano batted away most of his opponent’s attacks, repeatedly noting that he had voted the same way as many other Democrats. Their third and final debate drew sharper distinctions between the candidates than the first two, which had highlighted their similarly progressive stances. Some Democrats who want a new direction for their party hope that Ms. Pressley can mirror the success of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive newcomer who defeated another long-term party incumbent in New York. But with their primary less than three weeks away, recent polling has shown Ms. Pressley lagging behind Mr. Capuano in their highly diverse district — the only one in the state where people of color outnumber white people. It includes parts of Boston, Cambridge, Somerville and other nearby towns. "
1241,"It was about a minute into Jahana Hayes’s victory speech, which, to that point, consisted of two words — “Wow,” she said twice, gathering her composure — when she recalled the launch of her unlikely campaign for Congress just 102 days earlier, “with no money, no network, no people.” “People told me I had no chance and I had no business trying to do this,” she said on Tuesday. “We proved them wrong.” Ms. Hayes, 45, is the newly minted Democratic nominee from Connecticut’s Fifth Congressional District, defeating a more seasoned opponent, Mary Glassman, who had the party’s backing. If she defeats the Republican candidate, Manny Santos, a former mayor of Meriden, in November’s general election, she will become the state’s first black Democrat to serve in Congress. Her acceptance speech was, in many ways, a metaphor for Ms. Hayes’s life, one that began with diminished expectations: a childhood of poverty in Waterbury, where she lived in public housing and was briefly homeless before becoming pregnant at 17. She then embarked on a career in teaching that led to a National Teacher of the Year award. Her primary victory also marked a watershed moment for the teachers’ movement, in which educators are demanding better pay and labor protections in protests and strikes across the United States, from West Virginia to Arizona. And although Ms. Hayes’s story likely has many origin points, her nascent political career probably began on a different stage from the one in Waterbury that she occupied on Tuesday night. "
1242,"WASHINGTON — Being a billionaire president sometimes means confronting doubts that you understand the lives of regular people. That’s especially true for President Trump, who has built a political reputation for caring about working-class people despite decades of gold-plated living arrangements. On Wednesday, the question was put to Corey Lewandowski, the president’s onetime campaign manager: Does Mr. Trump comprehend the daily routines of most Americans — like pumping gas or buying groceries? Of course, Mr. Lewandowski said. “He loves to drive. I shouldn’t tell the story; I’ll get in trouble. But I remember he was driving his Rolls-Royce from New York City one day up to the golf course in Bedminster,” he recalled at a journalists’ round table organized by The Christian Science Monitor. “And guess what happened, right? When you’re in New York and you’re on your telephone, you’re driving your Rolls-Royce up to New Jersey, you get stopped. Right? And so I remember, he’s like: ‘Corey, I’m going to let you go. I just got pulled over.’” Mr. Lewandowski told the story with no hint of irony. It followed another example of Trump-as-regular-guy in which Mr. Lewandowski recalled Mr. Trump paying for dinner one night on the campaign trail in Iowa. “We went to an Iowa steakhouse and we sat down and there was about five of us. And the bill came and he took out his American Express card, which I thought was pretty cool,” Mr. Lewandowski said. “He took out his gold — his platinum — American Express card and he paid the bill.” Mr. Trump set off a fresh round of speculation about his understanding of the lives of most Americans late last month, when he claimed that shoppers needed IDs to buy groceries. But Mr. Lewandowski argued that the president is just like everyone else. He likes to drive (and sometimes gets pulled over). He takes his staff out for dinner. “He’s very aware of what things cost and what people do on a day-to-day life because — he’s rich, but that’s just who he is,” Mr. Lewandowski said. If there was a moment that Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager thought his Everyman stories might resonate poorly with the president’s most ardent supporters, it came near the end of the answer, when he quickly added a mention of fast food. “When we would go to a McDonald’s or a fast-food place on the campaign trail, he would know what it would cost because he would take out the cash and he would pay for,” Mr. Lewandowski said. “We go in and we’d buy the food and he’d get the change back.” “I think a misperception of Donald Trump is he has no understanding what things cost,” he said. “That’s absolutely not the case.” "
1243,"Once again, the president is talking about tapes. Not the “pee tape.” Not the “Access Hollywood” tape. Not the tape of Donald Trump recorded by his former lawyer Michael Cohen. The new tapes have entered the discussion thanks to the former White House adviser and reality-television personality Omarosa Manigault Newman, who is releasing recordings of White House officials. So far, they include one of her firing by Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly, and one of a telephone conversation with the president himself. She’s also promised the existence of yet another tape: a recording of Mr. Trump using a particular racial slur against black Americans on the set of “The Apprentice.” Rumors of such a tape surfaced during the 2016 election, but nothing materialized. And details of Ms. Manigault Newman’s account are fuzzy: She told NPR that she heard the recording herself, but wrote in her book that she was only told of its existence by third parties. (She claims there is no contradiction.) Nevertheless, the president was rattled enough to insist on Twitter that “there are NO TAPES,” while Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said she couldn’t “guarantee” that no such recording existed. At this point, the question is not only whether such a tape exists but, if it exists, whether it will matter. After all, Mr. Trump survived the “Access Hollywood” tape. His distaste for the black Americans he supposedly serves is not only obvious but, for some of his most committed supporters, part of his appeal. So why would this be the tipping point? The answer may have to do with the allure of the tape as an idea: not only the pee tape but the Watergate tapes as well. In the post-truth presidency of Donald Trump, there’s a great comfort in the concept of a recording that establishes a definitive record. "
1244,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced new sanctions on Wednesday against three organizations and an individual accused of facilitating illicit shipments to North Korea, keeping pressure on the government of Kim Jong-un amid ongoing negotiations over the dismantling of his nuclear program. The companies targeted by the Treasury Department are based in China, Singapore and Russia. The shipments, which violate sanctions imposed by the United States and the United Nations, include exports of alcohol, tobacco and cigarette products, as well as refined oil products. “Treasury will continue to implement existing sanctions on North Korea, and will take action to block and designate companies, ports, and vessels that facilitate illicit shipments and provide revenue streams to the DPRK,” Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in a statement, using initials for North Korea’s official name. “The tactics that these entities based in China, Singapore, and Russia are using to attempt to evade sanctions are prohibited under U.S. law, and all facets of the shipping industry have a responsibility to abide by them or expose themselves to serious risks,” Mr. Mnuchin said. He added: “Consequences for violating these sanctions will remain in place until we have achieved the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea.” The sanctions signal the Trump administration’s exasperation with North Korea, which is insisting on a declared end of the Korean War before it takes steps to halt and dismantle its nuclear weapons program. American officials did not consider that as a precondition to an agreement with Mr. Kim — to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula — when the North Korean leader met in June in Singapore with President Trump. But the new penalties are as much of a sign to China as they are to North Korea — that the United States is monitoring violations and will not let up until progress is made on denuclearization. The Treasury Department said that the China-based Dalian Sun Moon Star International Logistics Trading Co. and SINSMS Pte. Ltd., its affiliate in Singapore, used falsified shipping documents to export products to North Korea. Profinet, in Russia, is accused of providing fuel services to North Korean shipping vessels to help them avoid oil-related sanctions. The company’s director general, Vasili A. Kolchanov, was also sanctioned on Wednesday. Several weeks ago, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cited evidence from satellite photographs of continuing North Korean violations of the maritime bans. He has maintained that sanctions will remain in place, though there is evidence that the sanctions regime is fracturing as China and Russia see the crisis over North Korea’s nuclear program easing. While Mr. Trump has heralded the success of his meeting two months ago with Mr. Kim, the two countries have been stalemated ever since. Last week, John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, expressed his disappointment with North Korea. “We’re waiting for the North Koreans to begin the process of denuclearization, which they committed to in Singapore and which they’ve not yet done,” Mr. Bolton told CNN. "
1245,"Ned Lamont, a wealthy businessman whose prior bid for governor fell short, won the Democratic nomination in the Connecticut primary on Tuesday, handily beating his sole opponent according to The Associated Press, and sounding buoyant about keeping the governorship in Democratic hands. Democrats also chose Jahana Hayes in the state’s Fifth Congressional District, the A.P. reported. Ms. Hayes, a “National Teacher of the Year” in 2016, is seeking to become the state’s first black Democrat to serve in Congress. Ms. Hayes, 46, was thought to be a long-shot in the contest against Mary Glassman, a longtime local Democratic politician in the Western Connecticut region. But she embraced her status as an underdog, melding her life story — growing up in Waterbury, Conn., she went through homelessness, a teen pregnancy and economic hardship — into her campaign. She also won support from some of the same progressive organizations that supported insurgent progressive Democratic candidates like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who defeated Representative Joseph Crowley in a New York primary. Ms. Hayes will face the Republican Manny Santos, a former mayor of Meriden. [Get more results from Tuesday’s primaries here.] Unlike Ms. Hayes, Mr. Lamont, who will face the Republican Bob Stefanowski in November, was far more of a known quantity. Voters may have looked to Mr. Lamont’s electoral history, in particular an upset victory he pulled off more than a decade ago, in tapping him for the Democratic line. In 2006, Mr. Lamont upset the political order when he staged a shocking upset of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman in the Democratic congressional primary. He then lost the general election to Mr. Lieberman, who ran as an independent. Four years later, he lost to Gov. Dannel P. Malloy in the Democratic primary for governor. "

An estimated 300-foot stretch of the bridge, which serves as a major artery through the heart of the city, fell to the streets below, sending cars, trucks and blocks of concrete raining down. Officials have opened an investigation into what caused the disaster. Some witnesses said the bridge was struck by lightning before it buckled. Many, including ministers from Italy’s new government, called for a major overhaul of the country’s creaking infrastructure. _____ "
1247,"BUDAPEST — Across rural Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban dominates the media landscape. His allies control the major regional newspapers, which provide supportive coverage of Mr. Orban’s anti-immigrant agenda and his methodical erosion of the country’s democratic checks and balances. Critical, independent outlets are mostly absent. But last November, that looked set to change, if modestly, as the State Department announced a $700,000 grant to help nurture independent media outlets in rural Hungary. To the State Department, the grant would continue a longstanding American effort to promote free speech. To the Orban administration, it was another provocation from the United States, a country that had treated the prime minister like a pariah since 2012. Finalists for the grant were identified. But then, unexpectedly, the selection of a recipient was deferred in July, and the State Department announced that the money might instead be used in other parts of Europe. “A huge victory,” declared Andras Simonyi, Mr. Orban’s former envoy to NATO, and later the Hungarian ambassador to Washington. “This sends a message that Hungary is O.K., that Hungary is a democracy.” For years, Mr. Orban’s government has craved validation from Washington, spending millions of dollars on lobbying, mostly in vain. The Obama administration largely ostracized Mr. Orban, avoiding high-level, bilateral contacts as punishment for his creeping authoritarian tendencies. American diplomats criticized Mr. Orban’s crackdown on civil society — as did President Barack Obama himself. "
1248,"TAMPA, Fla. — There’s a side to Kenan Thompson that few “Saturday Night Live” viewers get to see, when he takes its stage, shortly before each 11:30 p.m. broadcast, to warm up the studio audience with his exuberant cover of the Spencer Davis Group’s “Gimme Some Lovin’.” “It’s helped me feel like a pivotal presence there,” said Mr. Thompson, who this May completed his record-breaking 15th season on “S.N.L.” “If the warm-up is off, the first couple minutes of the cold open are going to be off. It’s an important tone-setter.” The rock ’n’ roll ritual is the rare moment when Mr. Thompson will cut loose and allow himself to be the center of attention. Far more often, he can be seen on the show in key supporting roles. There are the eccentric characters who visit the “Weekend Update” desk (like the self-aggrandizing basketball patriarch LaVar Ball and an eerily upbeat neighbor named Willie) or the characters who hold together ensemble pieces (like the host of the fictional game show “Black Jeopardy!” and Steve Harvey, the M.C. of “Celebrity Family Feud”). This past July, his understated reliability helped earn him an Emmy Award nomination as a supporting actor in a comedy series, his first in that category. Over a decade and a half on “S.N.L.”, Mr. Thompson, 40, has grown to see himself as an integral part of this long-running entertainment franchise. But he had to get past his deeply ingrained modesty to achieve that recalibration. “I feel like there’s less pressure and stress just hitting it and quitting it. Let me get in, get my laughs and then I’m out,” Mr. Thompson explained. “As far as being the guy, the star, the lead role of something, I didn’t necessarily need that.” “Bring me in off the bench!” he added with a robust chuckle. “But to be a starter? To deal with the fact that, yeah, they need something from me every single week? I had to make that switch in my mind.” "

1250,"In late July, President Trump aimed his Twitter account at the platform itself: “Twitter ‘SHADOW BANNING’ prominent Republicans,” he wrote. “Not good.” The post followed reports suggesting that Twitter had limited some conservatives’ visibility on parts of its site in subtle ways — by, for example, downplaying them in certain search results. The quotation marks and all-caps styling signaled that the term, according to Trump house style, was both new and especially sinister. Headlines and news segments about “shadow banning” were, around this time, battling for space with stories about another unfamiliar term: “QAnon.” This is the name for a vast conspiracy theory that suggests, among many other things, that Trump was recruited by the military to overthrow generations of rule by a cabal of evildoers; that the Mueller investigation is actually a cover for an effort to expose a Democrat-run global pedophile ring; and that these narratives will converge in the arrival of “the storm,” during which the president will consolidate power and send his foes to Guantánamo Bay. These terms are best understood as signs of our time: paranoid, weaponized, online. But they also share roots in the web as it existed before the rise and dominance of mainstream social media. “Shadow banning” was popularized on a niche-but-influential forum called Something Awful. Its administrators and moderators, dealing with often-unruly and trollish users, were breezy authoritarians, removing, punishing and humiliating users for violating the rules, or simply because they wanted to. Shadow bans were intentionally cruel: They meant that users could continue to post, but that their messages were invisible to everyone but them; gradually, they would realize that they had been exiled. This suited portions of the site, where antisocial behavior was all but explicitly encouraged. But Something Awful prided itself, and still does, on never being quite as bad as its more anarchistic contemporary, 4chan — which would become the birthplace of QAnon, when someone using the handle “Q” began posting cryptic missives about Washington politics. The internet of old — composed largely of thousands of scattered communities populated by people who shared interests, identities, causes or hatreds — has been mostly paved over by the social-media giants. In this new landscape, basic intelligible concepts of community become alien: The member becomes the user; the peer becomes the follower; and the ban becomes not exile, but death. It is not surprising that the angriest spirits of the old web occasionally manifest in the new one. But what’s striking is how effectively they can haunt it, and how ill-equipped it is to deal with them. From the 1980s until the smartphone boom, attempts at creating online spaces for entertainment, deliberation or conflict were defined as much by who wasn’t there as by who was. Most people simply weren’t online, and among those who were, even fewer had the time or desire to participate vigorously in online communities. Broadly speaking, though, this relationship to online communities — you find them, rather than the other way around — placed a great deal of power in the hands of users who were able and willing to take part. Even the largest web forums felt vaguely subcultural, existing as they did in relative isolation from countless other communities online. They had their own rules, their own ways of enforcing them and their own reasons for being: to argue about music, to commiserate about an illness. Each forum was ultimately run by whoever owned it and moderated largely by volunteers. "

very February, white petals blanket first the almond trees, then the floor of the central valley, an 18,000-square-mile expanse of California that begins at the stretch of highway known as the Grapevine just south of Bakersfield and reaches north to the foothills of the Cascades. The blooms represent the beginning of the valley’s growing season each year: Almond trees are first to bud, flower and fruit. At the base of the trunks sit splintered boxes — some marked with numbers, some with names, some with insignias — stacked two boxes high on a wooden pallet that fits four stacks. Inside the boxes are bees, dancing in circles and figure-eights and sometimes just waggling. With almond season comes bee season. Everyone in the valley knows when it’s bee season. There are bee-specific truckers; motels occupied by seasonal workers; annual dinners to welcome the out-of-towners; weathered pickups with license plates from Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Florida parked in front of orchards at all hours of the night. And those ubiquitous boxes. This year the beekeepers responsible for those bees gathered on a mid-February Saturday for a potluck lunch at a community center in Kerman, a small town of ranch houses wreathed by acres upon acres of almond orchards. The meeting was supposed to kick off the pollinating season, but the beekeepers, many of them wearing tucked-in plaid shirts and trucker caps with dirt-curled bills, had already been at work for a couple of weeks, summoned to the state early by a heat wave. The sun beckoned the blossoms, and the blossoms begged for the bees. Farmers have a window of just a few weeks when pollination has to happen, otherwise the nuts won’t set, which is what it’s called when blossoms are pollinated and kernels emerge. When the nuts don’t set, much of a crop can be lost. By the time of the potluck, it seemed as if the season were already at its midpoint. The beekeepers lined up to fill their paper plates with pork chops, baked beans, chicken, rice, salad and three different kinds of cake. Teri Solomon, the organizer of the event and a longtime local beekeeper, collected $10 each for lunch. A list of speakers was taped to the table where she sat — respected beekeepers, bee brokers, scientists, a Fresno County sheriff’s police detective and a rep from the Almond Board of California. Topics of the day included the steady growth of the almond industry, the science of pollination, agricultural theft (hence the cop) and the ever-more-imperiled state of honeybees. That last item carried the most weight with the crowd, as they were all struggling to maintain the vast numbers of bees needed for almond pollination. Bees are central to an enormous agricultural industry — about one of every three mouthfuls of food we eat wouldn’t exist without bee pollination — and beekeepers’ custodianship of billions of these delicate animals is as much an art as it is a science. Beekeepers themselves, Solomon confided, are funny creatures: solitary in the field, trying to anticipate the needs of a finicky insect and, unlike that insect, social only once in a while. “We’re an odd bunch, very individualistic in nature,” she said. “But we’re in trouble.” Mostly the beekeepers and bee brokers — the agents who negotiate contracts between beekeepers and farmers — were trying to get a sense from one another of how badly bee populations had been hit, how much each was charging per hive and how much they could increase that price for the next season. There was talk of disease, pesticides, drought, floods, suburban sprawl, parasites. They talked shop: Which menthol strips are you using to inoculate your bees? How often do you change the treatment-laced pad placed in the hive to keep your bees healthy? Are the wafers or quick strips more effective for mites? Where do you apply them in the box, and for how long? Does the medication affect the performance of the bees? Can you get rid of a mite infestation, or are preventive measures the only option? About 10 years ago, the nation was seized with alarm when a Pennsylvania beekeeper lost 90 percent of his bees. He found that entire colonies had abandoned their queen. Losses like this were reported across North America and in Europe, but no one knows exactly what caused the die-off that came to be called colony-collapse disorder (C.C.D.). There hasn’t been a reported case of C.C.D. in years, but bee populations within colonies are still declining, and many scientists point to parasites as the cause. Since 2006, annual winter losses in colonies have averaged more than 28 percent, nearly double the historical winter mortality rate of 15 percent; in 2015, the U.S.D.A. reported more losses in the previous summer than the winter for the first time ever. According to Gene Brandi, a former president of the American Beekeeping Federation, the current plight of the bee population can be summed up in the four P’s: parasites, pathogens, pesticides and poor nutrition. "
1252,"Falling back on a standard excuse of besieged strongmen, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is blaming traitors and outside powers for his nation’s financial crisis, and describing the strong United States dollar as among “the bullets, cannonballs and missiles” foreigners are using to wage “economic war” on his country. Many emerging markets make themselves vulnerable to financial crisis by spending more than they can afford, and relying on foreign lenders to fund these profligate habits, but Turkey was an extreme case even before Mr. Erdogan took power in 2002. Of late, his reckless economic policies — including setting interest rates at artificially low levels, and driving up debts, deficits and inflation — have only made matters worse. Many wealthy Turks saw another crisis coming and were fleeing the country well before foreigners joined the recent rush, accelerating the fall of the Turkish lira over the past few days. Turkey’s troubles are homegrown, and the economic war against it is a figment of Mr. Erdogan’s conspiratorial imagination. But he does have a point about the impact of a surging dollar, which has a long history of inflicting damage on developing nations. Like many emerging world currency crises before it, this one comes at a time when the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, pushing up the value of the dollar. As the dollar strengthens, developing countries like Turkey have a harder time paying back their dollar debts, and eventually investors start to flee. Now the question is whether Turkey is poised to trigger a wider global crisis, the way the fall of the Thai baht did in 1997. The answer is not clear. The fall of the Turkish lira has had a negative effect on other emerging market currencies, but few of those countries share Turkey’s dual problem of having large foreign debt and government policies that fuel inflation. "
1253,"Democrats saw their preferred candidates score big wins in key House districts in Minnesota and Wisconsin on Tuesday, setting up high-stakes general election battles against Republican opponents. In safe Democratic districts, progressives notched a surprise victory in Connecticut, which may further signal the growing strength of the party’s left wing. Here are some of our takeaways: The Democratic Party has long attempted to brand itself as the party of diversity, and on Tuesday, voters delivered several results that may further support that claim. In Vermont, they chose Christine Hallquist — a transgender woman who backs a single-payer health care system and increasing the minimum wage — as the Democratic gubernatorial nominee. She is the first transgender candidate for governor among either major party. “Vermont voters chose Christine not because of her gender identity, but because she is an open and authentic candidate with a long history of service to the state, and who speaks to the issues most important to voters,” said Annise Parker, the chief executive of the L.G.B.T.Q. Victory Fund. Read more about Ms. Hallquist here. There were several other firsts on the Democratic side Tuesday. Jahana Hayes, who was named “National Teacher of the Year” by President Barack Obama in 2016, won the Democratic primary in Connecticut’s Fifth District despite having no formal political experience. Because the seat is a reliably Democratic district, Ms. Hayes is likely to become the first black Democrat to serve in Congress from Connecticut. In Minnesota, Ilhan Omar — a state legislator who last year became the first Somali-American to win public office — won the Democratic primary for the state’s Fifth District. Ms. Omar, who is Muslim, is poised to become one of the first Muslim women to serve in Congress, along with Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. Read more about Ms. Tlaib here. "
1254,"DALLAS — House Democrats, looking to wrest control of the chamber from Republicans in November, are discarding the lessons of successful midterms past and pressing only a bare-bones national agenda, leaving it to candidates to tailor their own messages to their districts. It is a risky strategy, essentially putting off answering one of the most immediate questions facing the Democratic Party after its losses in 2016: What does it stand for? The approach could also raise questions among voters about how Democrats would govern. Democrats say they have answered that question with a recently adopted slogan, “For the People,” a skeletal, three-point platform and a longer version, called “A Better Deal.” But with anti-Washington sentiment simmering; a deep divide between the party’s moderates and its left flank; and the brand of the party’s longtime leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, toxic in large sections of the country, they have concluded that a unified campaign framework emanating from Capitol Hill would do more harm than good. And as Tuesday night’s election results made clear, the primary season drawing to a close has made the search for a unifying message that much more difficult, elevating self-described democratic socialists like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York and Rashida Tlaib in Michigan to argue policy with a Trump-voting populist like Richard Ojeda in West Virginia and a centrist like Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania. [Here are four takeaways from Tuesday’s primaries.] The Democratic split was especially evident on Tuesday in Minnesota, where Ilhan Omar, a 36-year-old Somali refugee who was embraced by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, defeated four other Democratic candidates to run for an open seat. Ms. Omar stands in stark contrast to another Minnesota Democrat, Rep. Collin Peterson, a veteran centrist who voted against the Affordable Care Act. So across the country, Democrats will rely on their energized base and a loose message centered on a core promise of lowering health care costs and building a case that Republicans are using the government for their own advancement, which candidates are adapting as they see fit. If they are going to have a “blue wave,” Democrats say, it is going to come in varied hues. "
1255,"SEOUL, South Korea — The president of South Korea proposed a bold expansion of economic cooperation with North Korea on Wednesday, a more assertive stand than the United States has taken in offering inducements for the North to begin relinquishing its nuclear weapons. The proposal by the president, Moon Jae-in, included joint economic zones along the North-South border, a linked rail network and other steps. If implemented, they could significantly ease tensions along the world’s most heavily fortified frontier, which has divided the two Koreas for more than seven decades. But Mr. Moon’s proposal, dangled as a lure for the North to start denuclearizing, also raised the risk of going well beyond what his country’s most important ally, the United States, is prepared to do. Despite the goal of denuclearization pledged at the June summit meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, Mr. Kim has taken no meaningful steps toward that goal, an increased source of friction with the United States. Mr. Moon announced his proposal during a speech commemorating National Liberation Day, the end of Japan’s colonial rule over a then-unified Korea with the Allied victory in World War II. He framed the proposal as a way for both Koreas to move forward. "

Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota lost a bid to reclaim the Republican nomination for governor on Tuesday, demonstrating President Trump’s grip on his party. Mr. Pawlenty had called Mr. Trump “unsound, uninformed, unhinged and unfit to be president” in the weeks before the 2016 election, criticism that Mr. Pawlenty later tried to play down. Here’s our article on the primaries in four states, as well as four takeaways and the full results. Democrats delivered groundbreaking victories for a transgender woman in Vermont, a Muslim woman in Minnesota and an African-American woman in Connecticut. Also victorious on Tuesday: Senator Bernie Sanders. • And there’s finally a result in last week’s Republican primary for governor of Kansas. Gov. Jeff Colyer conceded to Secretary of State Kris Kobach, whose aggressive approach has prompted concerns among some Republicans that he would be too polarizing in the November election. • “We know some of you have heard some of it before. There have been other reports about child sex abuse within the Catholic Church. But never on this scale.” That’s the start of a searing grand jury report in Pennsylvania that was released on Tuesday, accusing bishops and other Roman Catholic Church leaders of covering up child sexual abuse by more than 300 priests over 70 years.

They were clearly blindsided by Elon Musk’s tweeting about his plans to take the company private, and several remain worried about his behavior. They have told him to quit Twitter — one even told him to stick to building cars and rockets. He doesn’t seem to be listening. On Monday, he tweeted that he was working with Goldman Sachs and the private equity firm Silver Lake as advisers. Turns out Goldman hasn’t formally signed on as his banker, and Silver Lake is only an informal adviser, interested in participating in any deal that emerges. The board has hired two law firms to help bring order to the chaos: Latham & Watkins will work on any transaction plans, and Paul Weiss will handle the S.E.C.’s inquiry into Mr. Musk’s tweets. Whatever happens, those directors have lot of work ahead of them. In other Tesla news: Saudi Arabia’s interest shows it’s hedging against a peak in oil demand. The scuffle between Turkey and the U.S. continues to heat up.

That’s on top of its president’s call for a boycott of U.S. electronic products. The U.S. isn’t likely to feel much impact, however. And the Turkish lira, which rebounded 8 percent yesterday after help from the country’s central bank, has already started to slide again. "
1259,"Erkal Aykac spent more than three decades showing Western tourists his beloved Turkey, meeting cruise ships in various ports, and shepherding groups through Hagia Sophia Church Museum and other ancient treasures in Istanbul. With four university degrees and speaking fluent English, he made enough for a comfortable life in Istanbul. He sent his daughter to boarding school, and handled the medical bills for his aging father. But the past three years have hit him hard, and with Turkey now facing an all-out economic crisis, he is bracing for the worst. The Turkish lira has dropped 35 percent over the past year, and tariffs recently announced by the Trump administration don’t bode well for the troubled currency. Though the lira has fluctuated in recent days, at one point it hit record lows against the United States dollar, setting off a panic over a potential domino effect that could reach other emerging markets. It was more bad news for a country that had only just begun to rebound from a horrific period of terrorism, including the June 2016 shooting-and-bombing attack at Ataturk International Airport that claimed 45 lives, and the March 2016 suicide attack on Istanbul’s Istikal Street in the city’s shopping district. The wave of attacks crippled the nation’s tourism sector, and a bloody failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his government in July 2016, followed by a widespread crackdown, political instability and diplomatic rows with the United States, Germany and the Netherlands, all served to further alarm potential Western visitors. Tourism from the United States dipped more than 40 percent from 2015 to 2017, part of a plunge that saw visitor numbers to the country sag about 30 percent. In May, the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism announced that visitor numbers were rebounding in 2018 — although the face of tourism to the Anatolian Peninsula looks decidedly different. Into the vacuum have come more and more holidaymakers from Russia, Asia and the Middle East, who have found Turkey — with its battered economy and cultural bounty — a newly affordable destination. "
1260,"To the Editor: Re “Tensions Mount Between Ankara and Washington” (front page, Aug. 11): Let me get this straight. Last year President Recep Tayyip Erdogan looked on while his thuggish bodyguards assaulted American citizens peacefully protesting in Washington, and President Trump did nothing. This year, Mr. Erdogan ordered the Turkish military into northern Syria to attack and drive out the Kurds, our staunch allies in the struggle against ISIS, while warning that American troops stationed with the Kurds risked receiving an “Ottoman slap” if they interfered, and Mr. Trump did nothing. However, now that a single American evangelical minister in Turkey is charged with espionage, Mr. Trump imposes strong sanctions and tweets, “Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!” How could they have possibly been considered “good” previously? Once again, the president blatantly panders to his fundamentalist base. Dennis Middlebrooks
Brooklyn To the Editor: It is inevitable that Turkey and the United States will be at loggerheads, not because they have major disagreements over policies, but because they have two egocentric leaders who feel that whatever they do is right and who cannot take any criticism. Inevitably the two will have a difference of opinion over a relatively small matter. Since they cannot be seen as “weak,” they will escalate the disagreement. The same will ultimately happen with Russia and China. All are led by “strongmen” who have an ego that is bound to conflict over some matter with President Trump’s ego. Jay Stonehill
Chicago To the Editor: Re “Turkey’s Downward Spiral” (editorial, Aug. 11): Turkey’s downward spiral started with the victory of Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 2003, who at that time hid his ultimate goal of converting Turkey from a secular democratic state to a theocratic, autocratic dictatorship. His nuanced approach initially has now been converted to a headlong rush to achieve this goal. He has alienated the United States along the way, fueled by his support of Hamas and suppression of peaceful Kurdish groups, not to mention his alliance with Russia. Under Mr. Erdogan, Turkey has drifted from a secular democracy to a theocratic dictatorship. Using blackmail by holding an American citizen as a prisoner on trumped-up charges, he has tried to put a nail in the remnants of democracy in Turkey. "
1261,"ISTANBUL — Turkey won a measure of international support in its increasingly tense standoff with the United States on Wednesday when Qatar offered a relatively small but symbolically important financial lifeline. Qatar pledged to invest $15 billion in Turkey after a lunch in Ankara, Turkey’s capital, between President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the emir of Qatar, representatives of both governments said. The sum is a small fraction of what Turkey would need to shore up its faltering economy or pay its dollar debts, which have become increasing unsustainable after a sharp decline in the Turkish lira. But the promise of investment was trumpeted by the Turkish news media as a victory for Mr. Erdogan on the same day that Turkey rejected a second legal appeal to release the American pastor Andrew Brunson. Turkey also sharply raised tariffs on American goods on Wednesday, as it pushed back against pressure from the United States. President Trump imposed 50 percent tariffs on imported Turkish steel last week after talks to release Mr. Brunson broke down, effectively cutting off Turkish steel makers from their largest foreign market. The dispute unsettled foreign investors already concerned about Turkey’s overheated economy and sent the lira to record lows last week, though the currency recovered some ground on Wednesday. "
1262,"A 12-year-old transgender student in a small Oklahoma town near the Texas border was targeted in an inflammatory social media post by the parents of a classmate, leading to violent threats and driving officials to close the school for two days. It all started on Facebook. Jamie Crenshaw, whose children attend public schools in the town, Achille, complained in a private Facebook group for students’ parents that the transgender girl, Maddie, was using a bathroom for girls. “The transgender is already using the girls bathroom,” she wrote last week. “We have been told how the school has gone above and beyond to make sure he has his own restroom yet he is still using the girls. REALLY.... Looks like it’s gonna be a long year.” Maddie usually uses one of the faculty restrooms. But on Aug. 8, her first day in seventh grade, she used the girls’ bathroom because she was in a new building and didn’t yet know where the faculty bathrooms were, said her mother, Brandy Rose, who asked that her daughter’s last name not be identified. The Facebook group, Achille ISD Parents, which is not affiliated with the school, appears to have been taken down, but screengrabs of Ms. Crenshaw’s original post and the resulting vicious comments were shared widely online. The Crenshaws did not respond to messages or return phone calls requesting comment. Maddie said that she was now afraid to sleep alone at night — but that even though she’s scared, she wants to stay in public school. "
1263,"Drug overdoses killed about 72,000 Americans last year, a record number that reflects a rise of around 10 percent, according to new preliminary estimates from the Centers for Disease Control. The death toll is higher than the peak yearly death totals from H.I.V., car crashes or gun deaths.   Analysts pointed to two major reasons for the increase: A growing number of Americans are using opioids, and drugs are becoming more deadly. It is the second factor that most likely explains the bulk of the increased number of overdoses last year. The picture is not equally bleak everywhere. In parts of New England, where a more dangerous drug supply arrived early, the number of overdoses has begun to fall. That was the case in Massachusetts, Vermont and Rhode Island; each state has had major public health campaigns and has increased addiction treatment. Preliminary 2018 numbers from Massachusetts suggest that the death rate there may be continuing to fall. But nationwide, the crisis worsened in the first year of the Trump presidency, a continuation of a long-term trend. During 2017, the president declared the opioid crisis a national public health emergency, and states began tapping a $1 billion grant program to help fight the problem. “Because it’s a drug epidemic as opposed to an infectious disease epidemic like Zika, the response is slower,” said Dan Ciccarone, a professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies heroin markets. “Because of the forces of stigma, the population is reluctant to seek care. I wouldn’t expect a rapid downturn; I would expect a slow, smooth downturn.” "
1264,"Omarosa Manigault Newman released a secret recording on Thursday that she said backed her claim that President Trump’s daughter-in-law had offered her a $15,000-a-month contract in exchange for her silence about her time as a White House adviser. The audio, released during an interview on MSNBC, is the latest in the trickle of recordings that Ms. Manigault Newman has made public to bolster the credibility — and sales — of her tell-some book, “Unhinged,” about her tenure at the White House. In the book, she claimed that the Trump 2020 campaign, which is partly overseen by Lara Trump, who is married to Mr. Trump’s son Eric, offered her a salary equal to what she had earned before being fired from the White House in December. Ms. Trump noted on the tape, which Ms. Manigault Newman said was recorded days after she was fired, that the money would come from campaign donors. “All the money that we raise and that pays salaries is directly from donors, small-dollar donors for the most part,” Ms. Trump said. “So I know you, you were making 179 at the White House, and I think we can work something out where we keep you right along those lines.” In a statement, Ms. Trump said that she had shared a bond with Ms. Manigault Newman during the 2016 campaign “as a friend and a campaign sister, and I am absolutely shocked and saddened by her betrayal and violation on a deeply personal level.” "
1265,"There was a time when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo used to shy away from criticizing President Trump. No more. Now, as the governor seeks a third term, he rarely goes even a day without slinging a one-liner at Mr. Trump or threatening to sue him. He has said Mr. Trump should be “ashamed” of the impact of separating families at the border, called on him to apologize to Puerto Rico (“They deserve more from you than paper towels”) and said his joint appearance with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin would have had the founding fathers rolling over “in their graves.” It represents a sharp change in tactics for Mr. Cuomo, who as recently as mid-2017 said he found “nasty ad hominem attacks” on Mr. Trump unhelpful. His rhetorical shift has far more to do with putting down an aggressive primary challenge from the activist and actress Cynthia Nixon in 2018 than any rumored presidential ambitions in 2020; one of Mr. Cuomo’s most recent television ads begins with the line, “He’s taking on Trump’s agenda.” But taking on Mr. Trump also thrusts Mr. Cuomo, whose extemporaneous speaking style can lead to verbal misfires, into the national spotlight, for better or worse.

1266,"The police in Sacramento are investigating an allegation that the lead singer of the pop-punk band Social Distortion punched a fan who protested his diatribe against President Trump during a concert last month. The fan, Tim Hildebrand, 30, said in an interview on Wednesday that the lead singer, Mike Ness, called the president a bigot and a racist during a concert on July 19 at the Ace of Spades. In response, Mr. Hildebrand said, he protested by holding up his middle finger. He kept it there for two to three songs and Mr. Ness eventually called him forward, Mr. Hildebrand said, adding that Mr. Ness punched him repeatedly in the head. Linda Matthew, a public information officer for the Sacramento Police Department, said Wednesday that the department was “aware of the allegations” and was investigating. Representatives for the band and for Mr. Ness, who criticized Mr. Trump during a concert last year, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday night. The recent episode gained traction online after videos of part of it surfaced last week. An interview that Mr. Hildebrand gave a local television station, CBS Sacramento, was broadcast Tuesday night, and he said he received crude messages on social media from about a hundred people as other news outlets picked up the story. Mr. Hildebrand, a longtime fan of Social Distortion, said he was not alone in the rebuttal to Mr. Ness’s speech, which he described as “anti-American” and “anti-Trump.” He saw some people walk out and others yell expletives at the singer. “It wasn’t like I was the single pea in the pod,” he said.

1269,"LEXINGTON, Ky. — One morning last week, Representative Andy Barr stood on a podium to celebrate the renaming of Veterans Affairs facilities here for two local World War II heroes, the result of legislation the congressman had sponsored. That afternoon, he toured the renovation of Castle & Key, a bourbon distillery in Frankfort, Ky. Mr. Barr talked up the benefits of a cut in federal taxes and his efforts to persuade Trump administration officials to back away from import tariffs that had prompted United States trading partners to retaliate against American distilled spirits, an issue of intense interest in the Bourbon Belt. They were go-down-easy events for the affable Mr. Barr, Republican of Kentucky, filled with ready smiles and glad hands. But there has been nothing easy about Mr. Barr’s effort to win a fourth term. He finds himself in one of the country’s most competitive midterm races against a first-time candidate, Amy McGrath, a Democrat and a former Marine combat aviator whose life story made an instant connection with voters. That has transformed the race into a tossup in a district that Mr. Barr won by 22 percentage points only two years ago. The incumbent is, by many measures, a good fit for the state’s Sixth Congressional District, moving seamlessly among the country club and horse industry elite in Lexington and in the more rural areas that reach Appalachia. “The hallmark of my representation is accessibility,” said Mr. Barr, 45. But the dark tones that advertising in the Lexington media market took on last week attest to a different kind of campaign brewing. "
1270,"Nancy Pelosi is girding for a mortal challenge to her leadership of the Democratic Party after the November elections or even sooner, and in a signal of reassurance to anxious lawmakers says that she is deliberately building a “bridge” to a new generation of party leaders.

One of Ms. Pelosi’s deputies, Representative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, said in an interview that he would seek the speakership if she struggles to amass the required 218 votes after November — an extraordinary acknowledgment of her vulnerability given the culture of deference in Washington. Ms. Pelosi remains intent on reclaiming the speakership, but in an interview on Wednesday she also acknowledged a handover of power was coming eventually, and she encouraged would-be successors to prove their political mettle. Any aspiring party leader, she said, must demonstrate that “they do have a following, that they’ve shown a vision for the country,” as well as the necessary fund-raising prowess. “If people want to be the bridge that I’m building toward, they have to show what’s on the other side of the bridge,” she said, stressing that she saw it as her role “to open doors, to build bridges, but there has to be another side to the bridge.” The most perilous threat to Ms. Pelosi, for the moment, may be the impatient mood in the Congressional Black Caucus, where senior legislators have begun arguing that it is past time to elect an African-American speaker. Black lawmakers and candidates, furious about President Trump’s caustic racial politics and attacks on African-Americans, say they are determined to claim a greater role in steering their party. "
1271,"ALEXANDRIA, Va. — Jury deliberations began on Wednesday in the trial of Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, who is charged with 18 counts of bank and tax fraud. The prosecution called 27 witnesses and presented 388 documents, including Mr. Manafort’s financial records and emails. The defense rested without calling any witnesses, which is not uncommon. Many factors could affect how the jury weighs the evidence. Here are some. Mr. Manafort’s close aide for nearly two decades, Mr. Gates helped Mr. Manafort with both his business and personal finances. At Mr. Manafort’s request, he testified, he doctored profit and loss statements, lied to accountants about Mr. Manafort’s foreign bank accounts and helped him deceive bank officers so that they would approve millions of dollars in loans for which Mr. Manafort did not qualify. But Mr. Gates was also a flawed witness. He has pleaded guilty to two felony charges and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in the hope of winning a lighter sentence. He also acknowledged committing a host of other crimes, including embezzling from Mr. Manafort’s accounts. On the stand, he vacillated between taking responsibility for his misdeeds and trying to minimize them. Asked why he lied on one financial document, for instance, he said he was merely doing his friend “a favor.” Kevin Downing, one of Mr. Manafort’s lawyers, accused him of leading a “secret life” that included at least one mistress, and possibly four. “By far, the most interesting thing that will play out will be the credibility battle between Manafort and Gates — the yin and the yang,” said Joyce Vance, a law professor at the University of Alabama. The defense is asking, she said, “Are you willing to believe Gates, a serial adulterer who stole from Manafort?” But imperfect witnesses are common, said Chuck Rosenberg, a former United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. “This happens all the time,” he said. “Drug dealers run with drug dealers; fraudsters run with fraudsters.” "

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, says she could not be sure whether President Trump has ever been caught on tape using a racial epithet against black people. And Trevor Noah says that is not O.K. On “The Daily Show” on Wednesday, Noah said he was appalled by Sanders’s evasion during a White House press briefing on Tuesday. After the former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman suggested she had heard Trump using a slur in a taped conversation, Kristen Welker of NBC News asked Sanders if she could “guarantee the American people will never hear Donald Trump utter the ‘N-word’ on a recording.” Huckabee Sanders replied that she couldn’t “guarantee anything.” Noah talked with Roy Wood Jr., a “Daily Show” correspondent, who brought up Trump’s history of publicly stating his mistrust of Mexicans, Muslims and other nonwhite ethnic groups. On “The Late Show,” Stephen Colbert pointed to another moment during that same press briefing, in which Sanders suggested that Trump could not be bigoted because he invited Hillary and Bill Clinton to his third wedding. "
1273,"Editor’s note: An Op-Ed by Sarah Smarsh, “Liberal Blind Spots Are Hiding the Truth About ‘Trump Country,’” received more than 1,500 comments from readers. Here are a selection of the comments, which raised questions that we put to the author. Mary V., Virginia: I had a conversation last week with a woman I had recently met. We were talking about the importance of supporting women in all types of roles — as professional chefs, doctors (she is an emergency-room physician) and throughout all levels of society, including politics. I casually mentioned how cool I thought it was that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had won her race in the Bronx. My companion’s demeanor immediately changed, and she flatly replied, “As a Christian and a capitalist, I have absolutely no interest in anything that socialist has to say.” The speed with which this happened was both startling and disturbing. Our friendly conversation was wiped out in a matter of seconds by her swift application of labels — her own self-identification, and to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Q: To what extent do labels prevent productive dialogue? Sarah Smarsh: A couple of years ago, over beers at a bar in Texas, my dad — a white construction worker from rural Kansas, described in my piece — shocked me by saying, “If you get past everything you’ve been told and really read up on it, ‘socialism’ doesn’t sound all that bad.” Soon after that, a democratic socialist, Bernie Sanders, won the Democratic caucus or primary for president in 22 states, including our home state of Kansas. Not everyone is so open-minded. The weaponization of terms such as “feminist,” “liberal” and “socialist” — and thus the vilification of those who claim those labels — has long been a successful pillar of strategies to preserve power. Labels always oversimplify, but at their worst they dehumanize: “illegals” or any racial epithet. You are right to be disturbed by the negative charge with which your acquaintance said “that socialist.” Diminishing a perceived opponent or an inconvenient fact through name-calling — say, “fake news” — is a hallmark of the current Republican administration, but dangerous labels work in all directions. Envisioning a “red state” as a field of “deplorables” leads some self-righteous liberals to say those states “get what they deserve” — as though everyone suffering for lack of Medicaid expansion voted for their conservative state officials, as though everyone even gets to vote. In most states, the losing political party receives 30 to 40 percent of the vote. Those millions of people, along with the disenfranchised, are no more represented by their state administrations than liberals nationally are represented by our current president. Calling their home “Trump country” is thus a childish misnomer. "
1274,"There will be no mention of Omarosa in today’s column. None. There are things that matter — the parlous military situation in Afghanistan, for example — and Omarosa and her explosive new tell-all, “Unhinged: An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House,” which is published by Gallery Books, a division of Simon & Schuster, just isn’t one of them. Period. Look, I’m not saying it wouldn’t matter if it turned out, as Omarosa alleges in “Unhinged,” that there could be a tape of Donald Trump using an infamous racial slur. That, indeed, would be newsworthy, assuming it’s true. I’m also not saying that Omarosa’s claim to NBC’s Chuck Todd that she personally heard the tape of him using that slur after her book went to press should be dismissed out of hand. But so far it’s just hearsay and speculation, and hence not worthy of a column in The Times. I mean, at least it’s not worthy of one yet. This is why this column will stick to Afghanistan, where hundreds are dead after the Taliban nearly overran the strategic city of Ghazni. Granted, it is interesting that White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders “can’t guarantee” that the president had never used the notorious epithet. Is this not a non-denial denial? If Sanders isn’t unwilling to give the president the benefit of the doubt on some of his other dubious claims, why would she be willing to be less-than-categorical now? But this, too, remains to be confirmed. Meanwhile, Pakistan, with its expanding nuclear arsenal, deteriorating economic situation, and ever closer ties to China, appears set to get a prime minister with pronounced sympathies for the Taliban. How should U.S. policymakers respond? "
1275,"Good morning on this feverish Thursday. Spotify users have created more than 20 playlists for the sole purpose of getting through the New York City commute. From Drake, Kanye and Cardi B to easy listening melodies, like Bon Iver, Enya and Norah Jones — the songs you listen to on the way to and from work can affect your mood and overall well-being. “Research in music psychology and cognition confirms what many people already know: Loud, fast music increases heart rate, breathing and blood pressure, while slower, quieter music has the opposite effect,” said Joy Calico, a professor of musicology at Vanderbilt University. Tailoring your commute playlist to how your day is going could be a benefit. “If the workday has been exhausting and you are now trying to get up the energy to go to the gym, that’s one playlist,” Ms. Calico explained. “If you leave work furious with a co-worker and that anger is threatening to follow you home, that’s another.” Nina Eidsheim, a professor of musicology at U.C.L.A., agreed. “If a commuter’s goal is to de-stress or to have a productive workday using music, I’d encourage them to think about what music puts them in which mood and to create their own highly personalized commuting playlist with that purpose in mind,” she told us. Manjinder Bhatti, 23, who takes the Q69/Q19 bus from Jackson Heights to Astoria in Queens, matches his commuting playlist to the time of day. “In the morning I play hard rock to wake myself up, and in the evening I play R&B and rock,” he said. So can listening to a podcast or audiobook have the same calming, or energizing, effect? “Music lends itself to endless repeat in a different way” than podcasts or books on tape, Ms. Eidsheim said. “Sometimes listening to the same piece of music on repeat is exactly what is needed.” "
1276,"Unless you’ve been hiding under a rock — an ever more appealing prospect this summer — you have no doubt noticed the televised election campaign being waged for Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s elevation to the Supreme Court. Oops, Freudian slip there. Supreme Court justices are not actually elected, although if you picked the wrong day to skip civics class, or if you just landed from Mars, you would be forgiven for thinking they appear on a ballot. For some time now, members of the court have been warning that the day was approaching when the world would “think we are sort of junior varsity politicians,” as Justice Elena Kagan put it during a visit to the University of Chicago last month. Justice Stephen G. Breyer has used the same phrase. And Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., speaking at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute last year shortly after the Senate’s almost completely polarized confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch, mused, “It is very difficult, I think, for a member of the public to look at what goes on in confirmation hearings these days, which is a very sharp conflict in political terms between Democrats and Republicans, and not think that the person who comes out of that process must similarly share that partisan view of public issues and public life.” If those fears have not already been realized, the day when they will be is hurtling toward us at accelerating speed. Here’s a spot entitled “Grand Slam,” paid for by the Judicial Crisis Network and now playing on a television screen near you. It showcases Judge Kavanaugh, on the night President Trump nominated him, proclaiming his fealty to the “American rule of law,” as the voice-over intones: “For conservatives, he’s a grand slam,” and, “Tell your senator: Confirm Kavanaugh.” The Judicial Crisis Network, which spent millions of dollars last year to block the confirmation of Chief Judge Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s nominee, and to promote Justice Gorsuch’s confirmation in his stead, announced three weeks ago that it had already spent $4.5 million on pro-Kavanaugh commercials, with a special focus on television markets in red states where incumbent Democratic senators are running for re-election. The Judicial Crisis Network is closely tied to Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society, which has provided the Trump administration with nearly all its judicial nominees so far. "
1277,"When Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia’s internal security service, told me during an early August 2016 phone call that Russia wasn’t interfering in our presidential election, I knew he was lying. Over the previous several years I had grown weary of Mr. Bortnikov’s denials of Russia’s perfidy — about its mistreatment of American diplomats and citizens in Moscow, its repeated failure to adhere to cease-fire agreements in Syria and its paramilitary intervention in eastern Ukraine, to name just a few issues. When I warned Mr. Bortnikov that Russian interference in our election was intolerable and would roil United States-Russia relations for many years, he denied Russian involvement in any election, in America or elsewhere, with a feigned sincerity that I had heard many times before. President Vladimir Putin of Russia reiterated those denials numerous times over the past two years, often to Donald Trump’s seeming approval. Russian denials are, in a word, hogwash. Before, during and after its now infamous meddling in our last presidential election, Russia practiced the art of shaping political events abroad through its well-honed active measures program, which employs an array of technical capabilities, information operations and old-fashioned human intelligence spycraft. Electoral politics in Western democracies present an especially inviting target, as a variety of politicians, political parties, media outlets, think tanks and influencers are readily manipulated, wittingly and unwittingly, or even bought outright by Russian intelligence operatives. The very freedoms and liberties that liberal Western democracies cherish and that autocracies fear have been exploited by Russian intelligence services not only to collect sensitive information but also to distribute propaganda and disinformation, increasingly via the growing number of social media platforms. Having worked closely with the F.B.I. over many years on counterintelligence investigations, I was well aware of Russia’s ability to work surreptitiously within the United States, cultivating relationships with individuals who wield actual or potential power. Like Mr. Bortnikov, these Russian operatives and agents are well trained in the art of deception. They troll political, business and cultural waters in search of gullible or unprincipled individuals who become pliant in the hands of their Russian puppet masters. Too often, those puppets are found. In my many conversations with James Comey, the F.B.I. director, in the summer of 2016, we talked about the potential for American citizens, involved in partisan politics or not, to be pawns in Russian hands. We knew that Russian intelligence services would do all they could to achieve their objectives, which the United States intelligence community publicly assessed a few short months later were to undermine public faith in the American democratic process, harm the electability of the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, and show preference for Mr. Trump. We also publicly assessed that Mr. Putin’s intelligence services were following his orders. Director Comey and I, along with the director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael Rogers, pledged that our agencies would share, as appropriate, whatever information was collected, especially considering the proven ability of Russian intelligence services to suborn United States citizens. The already challenging work of the American intelligence and law enforcement communities was made more difficult in late July 2016, however, when Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, publicly called upon Russia to find the missing emails of Mrs. Clinton. By issuing such a statement, Mr. Trump was not only encouraging a foreign nation to collect intelligence against a United States citizen, but also openly authorizing his followers to work with our primary global adversary against his political opponent.

Here’s what you need to know: • Aretha Franklin, who was universally acclaimed as one of America’s greatest singers in any style, died today at her home in Detroit. She was 76. In her indelible late-1960s hits, including “Respect,” “Think” and “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,” Ms. Franklin brought the righteous fervor of gospel music to secular songs that were about much more than romance. • She placed more than 100 singles in the Billboard charts, including 17 Top 10 pop singles and 20 No. 1 R&B hits. She received 18 competitive Grammy Awards, and she was the first woman inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, in 1987, its second year. Listen to 20 of her essential songs here. • The number of Americans who died from drug overdoses last year surpassed the highest annual death totals from H.I.V., car crashes or guns, according to new estimates from the Centers for Disease Control. That’s an increase of nearly 10 percent from a year earlier. Analysts point to two main reasons for the surge: More Americans are using opioids, and drugs are becoming more deadly. The epidemic was originally concentrated in rural, white populations, but it’s becoming more widespread. "
1279,"Good Thursday morning. (Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here.) Tencent, one of China’s most powerful tech giants, reported its first profit decline in a decade, and its shares fell as much as 5 percent. About $180 billion has vanished from its market value since January, with little good news on the horizon. And that’s mostly Beijing’s fault. There’s been a crackdown on gaming in China, Tencent’s biggest source of revenue. It’s a reminder that the forces that helped create Chinese tech titans — Tencent was largely shielded from overseas rivals — can also hurt them. As Jack Ma of Alibaba once warned, love the government, but don’t marry it. But the effect of Tencent’s struggles isn’t confined to China. Tech companies around the world saw their stocks fall, including U.S. chip makers. The reason: Everyone is looking to China for growth, and if even a Beijing favorite can’t catch a break, why should anyone else expect to? As concerns about Tesla’s future continue to grow, the time has come to ask about Mr. Musk’s mental state when he offhandedly tweeted his intentions. Jim Stewart of the NYT spoke to experts on mental health and entrepreneurship, who said founders like Mr. Musk are wired differently from most people, for good and for bad. “They’re quicker to spot and act on opportunities, but that same tendency can get them into trouble in other situations,” Scott Shane of Case Western Reserve University said. "
1280,"On the morning of Aug. 6, a law professor at the University of Michigan wrote a tweet about a family that had been separated by immigration authorities after crossing into the United States. Then the professor, Beth Wilensky, went for a run. Then she ate some lunch. “I came back and checked my Twitter feed and said, ‘Oh my goodness,’” Ms. Wilensky recalled. Her post was blowing up, on its way to getting tens of thousands of retweets. The tweet said: “My husband travels a lot. Downside: he’s gone a lot. Upside: frequent flier miles. We just used some to fly a 3-yr-old and his dad, who had been separated at the border, from Michigan (where the son had been taken) to their extended family. DM me if you have miles to donate.” A “zero tolerance” immigration policy from the Trump administration led to the separation of thousands of children from their parents or guardians this year. In June, President Trump signed an order meant to stop the separations. But hundreds of children remain in United States custody without their parents, according to the Homeland Security Department. Ms. Wilensky said she was seized by a desire to do something. She joined online communities of people who felt the same — citizens busy with day jobs and families of their own, now bound by Twitter threads, Reddit groups and Facebook pages. But faced with the daunting and sometimes inscrutable bureaucracy of immigration policy and enforcement, many people wondered how best they could help. "
1281,"Toying with access to classified information has become the White House’s go-to method for drawing attention away from screw-ups and scandals. On July 23, the White House faced a grim news cycle in response to President Trump’s disastrous Helsinki summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Then the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, announced that Mr. Trump was “looking to take away” the security clearances of a number of former top officials who had criticized him, among them the former C.I.A. director John Brennan. Early this week, the president flung insults at his former aide Omarosa Manigault Newman as speculation heated up over the existence of a tape of Mr. Trump using a noxious racial slur during his tenure on “The Apprentice.” Then on Wednesday, Ms. Sanders began her press briefing with a notice that the president had stripped Mr. Brennan of his clearance. It has become cliché to complain about the Trump administration’s use of distractions to divert the press from unwelcome news, but this time the White House didn’t even put any effort into hiding it. The document announcing Mr. Trump’s decision was dated July 26 — suggesting strongly that the White House had been saving it for a rainy day. (After this was pointed out, the administration quickly issued a second, undated copy.) What's more, Mr. Trump himself told The Wall Street Journal that he had revoked Mr. Brennan's clearance because of the former official's role in leading “the rigged witch hunt.” On one level, this particular distraction is vindictive but unimportant. John Brennan will be fine, and so will most of the other officials — including James Comey, Sally Yates and James Clapper — whose clearances Ms. Sanders threatened during the briefing. They have the power and visibility to continue criticizing the president as loudly as they like on cable news — and on Twitter, where Mr. Brennan has taken to attacking Mr. Trump as “treasonous” and “disgraceful.” The real risk is that this will strike fear into the many civil servants and government contractors who need security clearances for their jobs. As with the humiliation of Mr. Strzok, the message here for less prominent public servants is that the president has the power to destroy your livelihood if you voice dissent. And Mr. Trump appears to have taken his action without going through any process or consulting the relevant intelligence leadership, making this another exercise in unilateral norm-busting. When Mr. Trump first threatened Mr. Brennan’s clearance in July, the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, dismissed it as “just trolling.” He may have been righter than he knew: Wednesday’s announcement was thick with unintentional irony. In listing Mr. Brennan’s sins, Mr. Trump accused the former C.I.A. director of “erratic conduct and behavior,” “frenzied commentary” and “wild outbursts on the internet and television.” Sound familiar? "
1282,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Nearly three weeks after a wildfire closed Yosemite Valley to the public, park officials welcomed back visitors on Tuesday. This was great news for tourists from Israel, Italy, Germany and many other points on the globe who drove into a park still hazy from the diminished but still active Ferguson Fire. But the reopening was most likely a disappointment for some of the park’s longstanding residents — namely the bears, gray foxes, coyotes, deer and bobcats that had taken advantage of the park’s closing to ramble more freely across the valley floor. “The bears were having a field day,” said Scott Gediman, a spokesman for the park. “With so few people there they were roaming everywhere, kind of just walking around. It was cool, an unforeseen benefit.” The bears were especially happy to climb some of the apple trees in Curry Village and feast on the harvest. The closing came at the busiest time of year for the park, when visitors typically number around 15,000 to 18,000 people a day, Mr. Gediman said. He estimates the park lost between $2.5 and $3 million in admission fees, a shortfall that will force the park to dip into reserves. Yosemite was serene during the closing but filled with choking smoke from the nearby fires. The last time the park was closed for an extended period was during massive flooding in January 1997 that stranded hundreds of visitors and caused more than $250 million in damage. The park closed for two and a half months. "
1283,"ALEXANDRIA, Va. — Greg D. Andres looked like any ordinary guest at the Westin hotel here, standing near the valet in flip-flops and a white Notre Dame boxing T-shirt, waiting for a Postmates delivery from Shake Shack. The moment would be unremarkable save for Mr. Andres’s role as the lead prosecutor for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in the trial of Paul Manafort, concluding its third week here. Even the briefest glimpses of Mr. Mueller’s investigators, who have spoken publicly only in court papers and short court appearances since the inquiry began, draw notice. Mr. Manafort’s tax and bank fraud trial has provided the first real look at the special counsel’s team, the elusive players in the central drama of Washington political life and the subjects of fascination for the capital’s chattering classes. Tagged by President Trump as “17 angry Democrats,” they have shown themselves to be typical, if harried, government lawyers, staying at the hotel opposite the courthouse to devote most of their waking hours to trying the case. Other members of the special counsel’s office have joined Mr. Andres in the courtroom, including Andrew Weissmann, one of Mr. Mueller’s top deputies, who oversaw the prosecution from a seat in the back. Like a basketball coach during timeouts, he huddled with the others during recesses for strategy sessions, clutching a green government-issue notebook that the rest of the team used during the trial, making them easy to identify. The prosecutors snacked on Life Savers and orange-colored Starburst candy from jars that sat near Judge T. S. Ellis III. They drank from worn foam cups marked with their initials. Next to them sat a black catering-style cart labeled “Property of SCO” — Special Counsel’s Office — piled with binders of documents. Mr. Mueller’s spokesman, Peter Carr, whose “no comment” replies have become a running dark joke among the Washington press corps, sat among the spectators and reporters. He would not even confirm Mr. Andres’s order from Shake Shack, deferring to reportorial observation. "

1285,"WASHINGTON — A military parade ordered up by President Trump and planned for Veterans Day this year could be postponed until 2019, the Pentagon said Thursday. The abrupt decision to look into changing the parade date came as Defense Department officials said that the event could end up costing more than $90 million and as the Pentagon emerges from years of required budget caps. “We originally targeted Nov. 10, 2018, for this event, but have now agreed to explore opportunities in 2019,” said Col. Robert Manning, a Pentagon spokesman, in a statement. Defense Department officials said that the White House made the decision on Thursday after seeing the new proposed price tag. While department officials said that the plans for the parade had not been finished, they allowed that the event could cost as much as $92 million, as first reported by CNBC, depending on how many troops are involved. Previous estimates said the parade could cost $10 million to $30 million, about the same as one held in Washington in 1991 at the end of the Persian Gulf war. Already, veterans groups were criticizing the anticipated parade as too expensive. “Until such time as we can celebrate victory in the war on terrorism and bring our military home, we think the parade money would be better spent fully funding the Department of Veterans Affairs and giving our troops and their families the best care possible,” said Denise Rohan, the national commander of the American Legion. Soon after he was elected, Mr. Trump and his advisers floated the idea of a parade of military convoys through Washington. The committee planning his inaugural ceremony reportedly explored, but rejected, the idea of highlighting military equipment in the traditional parade, from the Capitol to the White House, after Mr. Trump was sworn in. In July 2017 in Paris, Mr. Trump saw firsthand the full potential and grandeur of a military parade as he sat alongside President Emmanuel Macron of France and by all accounts enjoyed a Bastille Day celebration. Upon returning home, Mr. Trump told Defense Secretary Jim Mattis that he wanted a similar parade in the United States. Mr. Mattis was not enamored of the idea, according to two other Defense Department officials. But the defense secretary, who carefully picks his battles with Mr. Trump, has since gone ahead with plans in tandem with a long-running Veterans Day parade in Washington. "

es, that’s the sound of glass shattering ahead of the midterm elections. And female candidates are stomping through the wreckage. It’s been an election year already dominated by a surge of women, and a record number of L.G.B.T. candidates. While the sheer number of women running is not a surefire path to change — many were running against each other in primaries or in tough districts — this week’s Democratic primary signaled that the zeal was translating into votes. Ilhan Omar, a Democrat of Minnesota, is in position to become one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress, after beating her closest opponent by more than 20,000 votes. She joins another Muslim, Rashida Tlaib, of Michigan, who won her primary last week. Ms. Tlaib is running unopposed in a very blue district. Jahana Hayes, a former national Teacher of the Year, moved closer to being Connecticut’s first black Democrat in Congress. And Christine Hallquist, a Democrat from Vermont, made history by becoming the first transgender candidate nominated for governorship by a major party. [What do you think of Gender Letter? Take our short survey and tell us!] Republican women entering the fray, though, are finding themselves in a bind, Kate Zernike, a Times national correspondent, reported this week. “Having long resisted identity politics, Republican women are reluctant or unable to claim any advantage to being a woman among voters,” she wrote. I took the opportunity to chat with Ms. Zernike, who has spent years covering politics, most recently in a new series called “Campaigning While Female.” "
1287,"WASHINGTON — The United States and China will return to the negotiating table late this month in an attempt to ease months of tensions that have been building since trade talks broke down this year and both countries began imposing escalating rounds of tariffs on each other. China said on Thursday that it would send a delegation led by Wang Shouwen, its vice minister of commerce, to Washington to meet with a group of officials led by David Malpass, the Treasury Department’s under secretary for international affairs. Although Trump administration officials have repeatedly said the ball is now in China’s court to revive the faltering discussions, the Chinese government said the trip was being made at the invitation of the United States. The talks come as the trade relationship between the two countries faces further deterioration. The Trump administration is preparing far more expansive tariff measures, including levies on another $16 billion worth of Chinese products that are expected to go into effect next Thursday. The administration is also scheduled to hold six days of hearings over the next two weeks to allow up to 370 witnesses to weigh in on plans for tariffs on a further $200 billion worth of Chinese products, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative said. If all of those tariffs go into effect, the United States would be taxing roughly half of the goods it imports from China each year, raising prices for a broad swath of manufacturers, retailers and other industries. The meeting between midlevel officials is a departure from the formal rounds of talks between top economic teams from the United States and China that took place during the early days of the Trump administration and the trade meetings led by Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Liu He, China’s vice premier in charge of economic policy, this spring. Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council, sought to lower expectations on Thursday and insisted that President Trump had no intention of backing down on his demands.

1288,"Facebook has made a mint by enabling advertisers to identify and reach the very people most likely to react to their messages. Ad buyers can select audiences based on details like a user’s location, political leanings and interests as specific as the Museum of the Confederacy or online gambling. And they can aim their ads at as few as 20 of the 1.5 billion daily users of the social network. Brands love it. So do political campaigns, like those for President Trump and former President Barack Obama, which tailored their messages to narrow subsets of voters. But microtargeting, as the technique is called, is coming under increased scrutiny in the United States and Europe. Some government officials, researchers and advertising executives warn that it can be exploited to polarize and manipulate voters. And they are calling for restrictions on its use in politics, even after Facebook, in response to criticism, recently limited some of the targeting categories available to advertisers. “It has essentially weaponized ad technology designed for consumer products and services,” said Sarah Golding, the president of the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, an industry organization in Britain. Her group recently called for a moratorium on political microtargeting. “There is a danger that every single person can get their own concerns played back to them,” she said. Facebook is just one player among tech giants like Google and Twitter that also offer data-mining services to try to influence consumer and voter behavior. But Facebook’s gargantuan reach, vast holdings of user data and easy-to-use self-service advertising system have made it a lightning rod for political microtargeting. Much of the new attention being paid to microtargeted advertising has emerged from investigations into how Russian groups interfered in elections and how the voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of millions of Facebook users. Microtargeting, they have found, was a central tool for foreign groups trying to interfere in elections. "
1289,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Honoring a soul music legend, protesting at Google and hiding a river of trash in Indonesia. Here’s what you need to know: • One word: respect. Tributes are pouring in for Aretha Franklin, the universally acclaimed “Queen of Soul” and one of the greatest vocalists of all time, who died at her home in Detroit. She was 76. In her classic late-1960s hits, including “Respect,” “Think” and “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,” Ms. Franklin defined a female archetype: sensual and strong, long-suffering but ultimately indomitable. Read our full obituary. “Aretha is a gift from God,” the singer Mary J. Blige once said. “When it comes to expressing yourself through song, there is no one who can touch her. She is the reason why women want to sing.” Here’s a playlist of 20 essential songs. _____ • The president versus the press. President Trump lashed out after over 200 newspapers, including The Times, published editorials about the dangers of his repeated attacks on the news media. "
1290,"The Trump administration is creating a special envoy post to coordinate the United States’ economic pressure campaign against Iran, the latest in a series of moves to cut off Tehran’s revenue and force it into a new nuclear agreement. The job will be filled by Brian Hook, currently the State Department’s director of policy planning, who was heading the negotiations before President Trump decided to abandon the 2015 nuclear agreement with Tehran. Mr. Hook faces an enormous challenge: Mr. Trump’s moves have been denounced by American allies in Britain, France and Germany who say they are still abiding by the terms of the deal — and are urging Iran to do the same. In an interview before his post was to be announced on Thursday, Mr. Hook conceded that the administration’s withdrawal from the  accord has strained relations with Europe. But he argued that it also opened new avenues of diplomacy. “The Iran nuclear deal — however much they think it is keeping the peace — has prevented nations from taking action against the full range of Iran’s threats to peace and security,” Mr. Hook said. “Now we can go after the Iranian regime revenues to deny them what they need to support Assad, the Houthis, and Iran’s militias and proxies,” he said, referring to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and rebels in Yemen. "
1291,"WASHINGTON — John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director under President Barack Obama, struck back at President Trump on Thursday for revoking his security clearance, calling the president’s claims of “no collusion” with Russia to influence the 2016 election “hogwash” and arguing that the commander in chief was trying to silence anyone who would dare challenge him. “Mr. Trump clearly has become more desperate to protect himself and those close to him, which is why he made the politically motivated decision to revoke my security clearance in an attempt to scare into silence others who might dare to challenge him,” Mr. Brennan wrote in an opinion article in The New York Times. He said the move made it more important than ever for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, to complete his investigation of Russia’s election misdeeds without interference from Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump’s decision to revoke the security clearance drew rebukes Thursday from national security officials and members of both political parties, who called it an extraordinary act of retaliation that reflected authoritarian tactics. “The fact that the president did this himself leaves him open to the criticism that it looks politically motivated,” Fran Townsend, who served as homeland security adviser in George Bush’s White House, said on CBS. “The notion that you’re going pull somebody’s clearance because you don’t like what they did in government service or you don’t like what they say is deeply disturbing and very offensive.” In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Trump cited what he called Mr. Brennan’s “erratic” behavior and “increasingly frenzied commentary,” as grounds for stripping the former intelligence chief of his access to classified information, saying that Mr. Brennan had abused his security clearance “to make a series of unfounded and outrageous allegations.” Mr. Trump’s decision, announced on Wednesday by Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, came only a few weeks after Ms. Sanders warned that Mr. Trump was considering revoking the clearances of Mr. Brennan and others who he believed had politicized and inappropriately profited from their access to delicate information. It was the latest assault by a president who has routinely questioned the loyalties of national security officials and dismissed some of their findings — particularly the conclusion that Moscow intervened in the 2016 election — as attacks against him. "
1292,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Wields Power of Office Against a Critic” (front page, Aug. 16): By revoking the security clearance of John Brennan, the former C.I.A. director, President Trump set another example of a president abusing power and punishing someone because he  criticized him. A cornerstone of a constitutional democracy is the right to criticize elected officials publicly, including the president. If this right is eroded, we will have lost what makes America special. Mr. Brennan, like so many other Americans, needs to continue to speak out and hold the president accountable to our laws and constitutional rights. Appropriate legal challenges to abuse of power by government officials are a viable alternative to meekly accepting the continuing actions by the president and his administration. Norman Siegel

1293,"Big lives cast long shadows on this week’s list of recommended books. In “Famous Father Girl,” Leonard Bernstein’s elder daughter, Jamie, describes what it was like having the renowned conductor/composer for a dad. “Empress” explains how Nur Jahan came to amass power and influence in a patriarchal dynasty that ruled much of what is now India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. And Claire Tomalin, whose acclaimed biographies have told the stories of Jane Austen, Charles Dickens and other literary giants, gets around to sharing her own accomplished and incident-filled life in a new memoir. It’s not all biography this week: Other subjects include evolution, financial crises and satires of millennial culture. John Williams
Daily Books Editor and Staff Writer A LIFE OF MY OWN, by Claire Tomalin. (Penguin Press, $27.) Claire Tomalin, the esteemed biographer of Samuel Pepys, Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, among others, tells her own story in this memoir. In addition to her professional life, Tomalin recounts the often challenging moments in her personal life — “one shock after another,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. “There is genuine appeal in watching this indomitable woman continue to chase the next draft of herself. After a while, the pages turn themselves. Tomalin has a biographer’s gift for carefully husbanding her resources, of consistently playing out just enough string. When she needs to, she pulls that string tight.” THE TANGLED TREE: A Radical New History of Life, by David Quammen. (Simon & Schuster, $30.) In his latest book, David Quammen — our critic Parul Sehgal calls him “our greatest living chronicler of the natural world” — surveys the field of molecular phylogenetics, plunging into how various findings have upended our conception of stately Darwinian inheritance, represented in the notion of the tree of life — of species branching out, evolving separately from each other. “There are few writers so firmly on the side of the reader,” Sehgal writes, “who so solicitously request your patience and delightedly hack away at jargon. He keeps the chapters short, the sentences spring-loaded. There are vivacious descriptions on almost every page.” CRASHED: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World, by Adam Tooze. (Viking, $35.) The crash of 2008, Tooze argues, was caused in both Europe and America, and its impact, he says, has been more political than economic, leading to a continuing wave of nationalism, protectionism and populism throughout most of the West. “Brexit, Trump, Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and China’s ever-escalating role in the financial system: Tooze covers them all and much more, in a volume that’s as lively as it is long — which is to say very, on both counts,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes, calling “Crashed” a “bravura work of economic history.” HITS AND MISSES: Stories, by Simon Rich. (Little, Brown, $25.) This collection of 18 satirical stories — by an author who makes the difficult look so easy you could think of him as the Serena Williams of humor writing — pokes fun at the foibles of millennial culture. Rich is at the height of his craft when his work “treats the absurd completely seriously as it darts seamlessly between humor and gravity,” Nate Dern says in his review. “Rich has sharpened his satire over the years, and he now wields it with skill — but he does not cut a wide swath. His tool is a scalpel, not a broadsword.” THE MIDDLEMAN, by Olen Steinhauer. (Minotaur, $27.99.) In this fast-moving thriller from the creator of “Berlin Station,” a revolutionary anticapitalist movement seeks to unite the disaffected of America’s red and blue states. Scott Turow, our reviewer, says that “The Middleman” is “smart and entertaining and consistently intriguing, clipping along in brief chapters, somewhat reminiscent of the novels of James Patterson, and often animated by lovely, spare descriptive writing.” "
1294,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday assailed the media for editorials in newspapers across the country that championed the freedom of the press, a unified response in the face of the president’s relentless attacks. In a series of morning Twitter posts, Mr. Trump said The Boston Globe was “in collusion” with other newspapers for leading the editorial effort, choosing a word that has become synonymous with the special counsel’s investigation into Russian election interference — an investigation that he has repeatedly called a “witch hunt” and a “hoax.” Trump also added “PROVE IT!” in one of the messages, though it was not clear what he meant. In a subsequent tweet, he wrote that he was in favor of “true FREEDOM OF THE PRESS,” but repeated accusations that most of the news it produced was fake or pushing a particular political agenda. Earlier in the morning, Mr. Trump also called the “fake news media” the “opposition party.” The president has called the press the enemy of the people and rallied his supporters to speak out against the news media, a directive critics have said could lead to violence against journalists. Earlier this month, a senior editor at The Globe proposed that newspapers publish editorials about “the dangers of the administration’s assault on the press.” "
1295,"The naturalization of Melania Trump’s parents last week in a private ceremony in Manhattan led many of our readers to question President Trump’s opposition to family-based immigration. In recent months, Mr. Trump has derided the program that his in-laws, Amalija and Viktor Knavs, used to become United States citizens. Calling it “chain migration,” he has argued that it must be restricted in favor of more merit-based immigration. A few readers talked about relatives and friends who they feel have abused family visas as proof that the program should be curtailed. But others offered themselves and their families as examples of Americans who, they argue, are just as deserving as the Knavses, if not more, of family-based immigration. Here is a condensed and lightly edited selection of the comments. Tell us in the comments how you see the issue. My husband and I are U.S.-born citizens. Our legally adopted kids from an African country were granted green cards but must wait over a year and a half to receive their certificate of citizenship, thanks to the Trump administration’s slowdown on processing forms. They cannot take money out of their personal bank accounts, cannot apply for drivers’ licenses nor apply for college because their green cards expired while we wait. I am an American citizen who is married to a lovely Japanese woman and citizen of Japan. We have two kids, both of whom are also American citizens. We are in our fourth year of dealing with the bureaucracy of the U.S. immigration department, having to obtain countless documents, translations from Japanese to English and now having to find the inoculation records of my 48-year-old wife. Who, besides children, have their measles mumps and rubella records? "
1296,"To the Editor: Re “A Free Press Needs You” (editorial, Aug 16): Never in my wildest dreams (nay, nightmares) would I have thought it necessary for American newspapers from coast to coast to defend their constitutional role of oversight of government.

Long may they continue to provide us with the eyes and ears to learn how our federal, state and local governments operate. Jay N. Feldman
Port Washington, N.Y. To the Editor: Choosing a day for hundreds of newspapers to publish an inspiring message supporting a free press is certainly admirable, but how about something more meaningful? Show that same solidarity by taking the oxygen out of the White House briefing room. Eliminate the pretense that any reasonable amount of truth is being offered by the administration. One and all, the press corps should simply not show up, thus depriving the press secretary, or whoever’s turn it is to destroy any integrity that she or he may have, of an audience for the nonsense spewing forth from that podium. Neil G. Bennett
New York To the Editor: Re “The Times Joins an Effort to Combat Trump’s Press Attacks” (Business Day, Aug. 15): The call to arms by The Boston Globe, picked up by your editorial, cited as justification “the administration’s assault on the press.” In fact, the “assault” responsible for the Sturm und Drang has been the concerted, nonstop anti-Trumpism of so much of the media. In the vanguard, and proud of it, is The New York Times, from its wall-to-wall anti-Trump editorials, columns and Op-Ed articles to the slanted reporting of the news. Only President’s Trump’s over-the-top response, where a more measured response would have served, allows those who heed the call to portray themselves as victims. Donald Nawi
Scarsdale, N.Y. To the Editor: Scanning the comments from newspapers across the country regarding a free press reminds me of a 2010 speech given by President Obama to the graduating class at the University of Michigan. He said: “If you’re someone who only reads the editorial page of The New York Times, try glancing at the page of The Wall Street Journal once in a while. If you’re a fan of Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh, try reading a few columns on the Huffington Post website.” In other words, he advocated being open-minded. His message has resonated ever since. So different from the climate today. I’m grateful for all newspapers, community and national, for keeping us informed! Edith Broida

1297,"LOS ANGELES — If I were a young artist choosing a big coastal city to land in, I’d opt for Los Angeles. No contest. Sure, there are problems, starting with traffic, sprawl and gentrification. Housing is hard to find here. It is in New York too, but here the weather’s kinder. As in New York, unless you’re a cis white male, you’ll likely have art-world entry issues here. In Los Angeles, though, art world ethnic mixing and gender parity, to the extent that they exist, at least feel relatively unforced and organic. And I’m sure many people are working hard to make that so. Maybe the convincer is, despite the gas-eating miles between everything here, the city still has something like old-time art communities, a social network still only partly regulated by the imperatives of the market machine. The city’s museums, even its biggest ones, also have a certain independent streak, a willingness to depart from standard models in the kinds of shows they do and the way they do them, as I noted when I recently dropped in on a few. Hammer Museum O.K., I confess, my take on the Los Angeles art world as manageable, equitable and communal is heavily based on seeing an exhibition called “Made in L.A. 2018” at the Hammer Museum. The first edition of the show was in 2012, conceived as a biennial for local talent, though only a small number of this year’s artists were born here. Most are transplants who’ve stayed, which says something positive right there. Even more positive: Of the 33 participants, two-thirds are women. Several are black, Latino or of Asian descent, and at least as many self-identify as queer. The show doesn’t tout these demographics. It treats diversity as natural, normal. "
1298,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Michael Cohen’s dramatic admission, an ex-Nazi’s deportation and two artists’ singular taxidermy creations. Here’s the latest: • President Trump’s difficult day. His former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, admitted in court that Mr. Trump directed him to pay two women — the adult film star Stormy Daniels and the Playboy model Karen McDougal — hush money “for the principal purpose of influencing the election.” Mr. Cohen, once a loyal ally to the president, pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws and multiple counts of tax evasion and bank fraud. Minutes after Mr. Cohen’s extraordinary admission, a separate courtroom delivered Mr. Trump a second blow: his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was convicted of financial fraud. He faces a second trial next month on charges of obstruction of justice and failure to register as a foreign agent. Both of the dramatic cases could add momentum to the Russia investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, which has so far produced more than 100 criminal counts against 32 people. "

1300,"To the Editor: Re “Pleading Guilty, Cohen Implicates President” (front page, Aug. 22): President Trump’s “fixer” may have just fixed America’s nightmare. Michael Cohen’s stunning guilty plea on Tuesday directly linked Mr. Trump to paying off women he allegedly had affairs with in order to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Cohen, who has said he would “take a bullet for the president” and is facing real prison time, decided to give sworn testimony that may turn out to be the fatal blow to Mr. Trump’s presidency. While there was no cooperation clause in Mr. Cohen’s plea, there is little doubt that prosecutors from the Southern District of New York would not have accepted Mr. Cohen’s guilty plea had he not already begun to cooperate. Along with the conviction of Paul Manafort, the president’s former campaign chairman, in Virginia at almost the same moment that Mr. Cohen was pleading, Donald Trump is several steps closer to becoming a former president. Henry A. Lowenstein
New York To the Editor: Re “In Manafort Trial, Conviction on 8 of 18 Charges” (front page, Aug. 22): Some have pointed out that the lesson of Paul Manafort’s trial is that you shouldn’t lie about your income. This is true! But there’s another takeaway: Working for Donald Trump doesn’t end well. Mr. Manafort would have likely gotten away with his crimes if he’d never been part of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. Simon Brown
Washington To the Editor: Re “The Michael Cohen Conundrum,” by Christopher Buskirk (Opinion Today newsletter, Aug. 22): Yes, Mr. Buskirk, Michael Cohen “lies a lot,” just as Donald Trump lies a lot.

1302,"Updated Aug. 23, 2018: The education community has responded to Secretary DeVos’s policy proposal. Read the latest here. WASHINGTON — The Education Department is considering whether to allow states to use federal funding to purchase guns for educators, according to multiple people with knowledge of the plan. Such a move appears to be unprecedented, reversing a longstanding position taken by the federal government that it should not pay to outfit schools with weapons. And it would also undermine efforts by Congress to restrict the use of federal funding on guns. As recently as March, Congress passed a school safety bill that allocated $50 million a year to local school districts, but expressly prohibited the use of the money for firearms. But the department is eyeing a program in federal education law, the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants, that makes no mention of prohibiting weapons purchases. That omission would allow the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, to use her discretion to approve any state or district plans to use grant funding for firearms and firearm training, unless Congress clarifies the law or bans such funding through legislative action. “The department is constantly considering and evaluating policy issues, particularly issues related to school safety,” said Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department. “The secretary nor the department issues opinions on hypothetical scenarios.” The $1 billion student support program, part of the Every Student Succeeds Act, is intended for academic and enrichment opportunities in the country’s poorest schools and calls for school districts to use the money toward three goals: providing a well-rounded education, improving school conditions for learning and improving the use of technology for digital literacy. "
1303,"The federal campaign finance and tax evasion case that is embroiling the White House began in the unlikeliest of places: the world of supermarket tabloids. It is populated by porn stars and Playboy models, shadowy “story brokers” and the ultra rich and powerful, who can buy back their secrets on an underground exchange run by gossip scribes who set the rules, the prices and, frequently, the reputational toll. That world has now come to life on the stark pages of federal court documents that detail violations of campaign finance and tax laws, implicating President Trump and reprising Watergate-era talk of “high crimes and misdemeanors” and possible impeachment. In laying out the charges to which Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s longtime lawyer, pleaded guilty on Tuesday, the documents filed in New York also entangle several unidentified people in Mr. Trump’s business and from his campaign. The anatomy of the crime the court papers describe — stemming from hush money payments to two women who claimed they had sexual encounters with Mr. Trump — has a reality-television twist that has come to typify the Trump presidency. One of the women, the pornographic film star Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels, went public with her story earlier this year in a media blitz, and she was represented by a brash lawyer who says he now is considering running for president. "
1304,"News broke Tuesday afternoon that a jury in Alexandria, Va., had found Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign manager, guilty on eight counts: five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud and one count of failure to disclose a foreign bank account. Minutes before that, in New York, Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance law and other charges, implicating the president in his statement. How should we make sense of this? Sharon LaFraniere, a New York Times investigative reporter who covered the Manafort trial for 16 days, discussed the two criminal cases on Facebook Live with our audience. Here are nine questions sent in by viewers, along with her answers. Questions and answers have been lightly edited for clarity. I think Michael Cohen’s guilty plea is more momentous for the president. He implicated Mr. Trump in two crimes involving campaign finance violations, and President Trump said today that Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to two counts that are not crimes, but I think the president’s critics will seize on that and say, “Well, why would your lawyer plead guilty if these were not crimes?” In Michael Cohen’s case, his plea agreement did not include an agreement to cooperate with ongoing investigations and that’s sort of an outstanding question: Why didn’t it? In Mr. Manafort’s case, he faces a second trial coming up in September on seven additional counts, so it’s not over for Mr. Manafort by any means. "
1305,"WASHINGTON — There are more serious crimes than violating campaign finance laws. Some offenders face jail time, while others catch a break. But the campaign finance violation President Trump’s former lawyer accused him of on Tuesday — arranging to pay hush money to influence an election — may nonetheless be precisely the sort of offense that the drafters of the Constitution meant to cover in granting Congress the power to impeach and remove a president. “At the constitutional convention, the framers repeatedly expressed anxiety about the president seeking to obtain office through corrupt means,” said Joshua Matz, an author of “To End a Presidency: The Power of Impeachment.” “In fact,” he said, “that was one of the principal reasons they included an impeachment power in the first place.” Mr. Trump is unlikely to face criminal prosecution while he is in office, as the Justice Department’s longstanding policy and something approaching a scholarly consensus say that the Constitution does not permit criminal proceedings against a sitting president. And political realities will probably protect him from impeachment proceedings, at least as long as Republicans control the House of Representatives. But legal scholars said that committing crimes aimed at undermining the integrity of an election could well satisfy the constitutional standard for impeachment, which is set out in Article II, Section 4: “The president, vice president and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” "
1306,"SAN DIEGO — Ammar Campa-Najjar is the son of an Arab father and a Mexican-American mother. His campaign for Congress has been embraced by Democratic activists across the nation. He is an advocate of tough environmental measures, including a permanent moratorium on offshore drilling, and legal protections for immigrants who were brought into this nation as children. At 29, he has never run for office and is barely known in this suburban San Diego district near Camp Pendleton. But Mr. Campa-Najjar abruptly emerged Wednesday as a decidedly credible candidate to represent this solidly Republican enclave in a Democratic state, after the incumbent, Representative Duncan Hunter, a Republican, was indicted with his wife Tuesday on charges of using $250,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses. The indictment came on the same day that President Trump’s former campaign chairman was found guilty of defrauding the federal government and his longtime personal lawyer pleaded guilty to campaign finance crimes, which he said he committed at the direction of Mr. Trump. Mr. Campa-Najjar’s campaign had been something of a stepchild in a state that had been at the forefront of the Democratic battle to win control of Congress, attracting little attention. (“There were other mouths to feed,” he said of the party’s California priorities.) But on Wednesday, he found himself in a whirlwind: calls from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, a run of media interviews and an influx of contributions, as he became the latest rallying point for party activists excited by the prospect of a blue victory in a deeply red region of the nation. Democrats had been focusing on seven Republican-held seats in this battleground state; that number has now grown to eight. "
1307,"Congressional Republicans have been operating under a see-no-evil policy with President Trump: ignoring his lying, his subversions of democratic norms and his attacks on government institutions or, when that’s not possible, dismissing such outrages as empty bluster — as Trump being Trump. This brazenly partisan act has become even more strained since Tuesday, when Michael Cohen, the president’s longtime lawyer and fixer, directly implicated the president in criminal activity. Mr. Cohen asserted in a plea deal with federal prosecutors that, in the closing weeks of the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump directed him to use illegal campaign contributions to pay hush money to two women who said they had sex with him. Also on Tuesday, a federal jury convicted Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, of bank and tax fraud. How did Mr. Trump react? More like a Mafia don than a guardian of the rule of law. While criticizing Mr. Cohen on Wednesday, the president tweeted that, by contrast, he had “such respect for a brave man” like Mr. Manafort, who “refused to ‘break’ … to get a ‘deal.’ ” The president, in other words, felt moved to praise a convicted felon for refusing to cooperate in the pursuit of justice. And how did Republicans in Congress react? They didn’t, if they could avoid it. John Cornyn, the majority whip in the Senate, shrugged that he had “no idea about what the facts” of Mr. Cohen’s guilty plea were “other than the fact that none of it has anything to do with the Russia investigation.” The office of the House speaker, Paul Ryan, said it needed “more information.” Most members opted for silence. Let’s set aside, for the moment, the duty of lawmakers to the Republic and the Constitution and instead consider simple political self-interest. Even by this standard, Republicans’ behavior is beginning to look like masochism if not simple madness. When members of Mr. Trump’s party pooh-pooh his thuggish rantings and otherwise signal that they will overlook even his most dangerous behavior, they are inviting him to act out even more. Like a willful toddler, Mr. Trump lives to test limits. Republican lawmakers need not attack Mr. Trump in order to stop enabling his worst impulses and begin distancing themselves from his corruption. They simply need to stop cowering. An obvious first step is for Congress to pass legislation protecting Robert Mueller’s Russia inquiry, which has become the bane of Mr. Trump’s existence. The president has toyed with the idea of firing Mr. Mueller and his superior, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, moves that would ignite a constitutional crisis. Lawmakers are deluding themselves to think that he won’t consider such radical acts again as his predicament grows more dire. "
1308,"In the hours after two of President Trump’s former advisers delivered his administration potentially grave legal setbacks, the mood inside the White House was grim, a return to a trench-warfare mentality born out of muscle memory. But there remained a pervasive belief, rightly or wrongly, that things have looked this bad before. That was little consolation to advisers who admitted they had no strategy for countering the news that Mr. Trump’s former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, had admitted in federal court that Mr. Trump directed him to arrange payments to two women during the 2016 campaign to silence them from talking publicly about affairs they said they had with Mr. Trump. Nor was there a plan, according to interviews with half a dozen current and former aides, to put a spin on the conviction of Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, on eight counts of financial fraud. The only option was to follow Mr. Trump’s lead. The president, returning to a well-worn tactic of scouring media reports for any opportunity that would allow him to seize the news cycle again, decided not to cancel a planned sit-down with Fox News on Wednesday. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, was left to repeatedly refer to the president’s past comments on the matter. “He did nothing wrong,” Ms. Sanders said at least three times in a briefing to reporters, a sentiment that White House employees have told themselves in private conversations. “There are no charges against him.” But this time, advisers noticed that the president, a man who has in the past relished the idea of leading his troops into political battle, seemed subdued. He appeared to realize the serious nature of what had just taken place, and yet his relative calm — contrasted with his more typical lashing out when he is anxious — unnerved some of his aides. "
1309,"WASHINGTON — For those wondering if the latest disclosures from the Trump legal file are finally weighty enough to cause top congressional Republicans to break from the president, the answer is no. Twenty-four hours after President Trump was hit with a double-barreled barrage of felony convictions against two former close advisers, leading Senate Republicans did not appear particularly agitated. They found several reasons to look past sworn testimony by the president’s former personal lawyer that Mr. Trump had directed him to break the law by preventing two women from providing pre-election accounts of their sexual relationships with Mr. Trump — accounts that could have conceivably changed some votes in November 2016. There were mentions of the strained credibility of the former Trump lawyer, Michael D. Cohen. And references to Bill Clinton’s dalliances and how Democrats didn’t think those were such a big deal 20 years ago. And a belief that some of that misbehavior was far in Mr. Trump’s past. “Eight years ago to 10 years ago, Trump was not what I consider to be a pillar of virtue,” said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the senior Republican member of the Senate. “I think he has changed a lot of his life once he was elected. I think Trump is a much better person today than he was then.” Mr. Hatch continued: “I think most people in this country realize that Donald Trump comes from a different world. He comes from New York City, he comes from a slam-bang, difficult world. It is amazing he is as good as he is. If anything, you have to give him plaudits for the way he has run the country as president.” In addition to crediting Mr. Trump’s presidential performance, other top Republicans suggested that Mr. Cohen was not to be believed and that this was a matter for the courts — not Congress — to explore. "
1310,"South Korea and North Korea recently announced plans for a third summit meeting between their two leaders, to take place in Pyongyang in September. From family reunions to fielding a joint sports team in the upcoming Asian Games, the two Koreas are moving forward with steps to further détente on the peninsula. By contrast, the United States has done very little in the two months since the Singapore summit between President Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to advance the relationship. The United States appears to be waiting for the North to take the next step. But the Trump administration is ignoring the reality that to reach a final deal on the eventual denuclearization of North Korea, the United States must give something substantial in return. Above all, Washington must take steps to ease North Korean fears of an American attack. Without such a guarantee, the North will never surrender its nuclear arsenal. Earlier this month, the national security adviser, John Bolton, said that “The United States has lived up to the Singapore declaration. It’s just North Korea that has not taken the steps we feel are necessary to denuclearize.” And outside of the Trump administration, many other observers have said “I told you so,” blaming North Korea for that lack of progress while arguing that North Korea will never denuclearize. The Washington Post called North Korea’s hesitation to take action “stiff resistance from a North Korean team practiced in the art of delay and obfuscation.” "
1311,"HAWESVILLE, Ky. — President Trump’s aluminum tariffs have rattled global businesses, set off retaliatory levies and started to eat into profits of some major American companies. But they have also provided a lifeline to other United States businesses, like Century Aluminum, the struggling smelter in Kentucky that is at the heart of Mr. Trump’s trade fight. After years of foreign competition that eroded Century’s market share, prompted layoffs and put its smelter here on the brink of perpetual collapse, the company is now riding high. Century is planning to invest over $150 million to more than double output at the plant, and add 275 jobs in the process. The average salary and benefits package for a worker is $90,000 a year. On Wednesday, Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, took a victory lap to mark the revival of Century, which is reaping the dividends of Mr. Trump’s trade war. “It’s days like this that I hoped would happen when I took the job in Washington,” Mr. Ross, a former steel magnate, said to a room of workers at the plant here. “We’re going to keep going, despite what the naysayers say.” "
1312,"WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced another crackdown on Wednesday on opioids, targeting doctors and drug dealers alike in cases that spanned physicians’ offices in Ohio, drugmakers in China and online black markets. “Today’s announcements are a warning to every trafficker, every crooked doctor or pharmacist, and every drug company, every chairman and foreign national and company that puts greed before the lives and health of the American people,” Mr. Sessions said at a news conference in Cleveland, a city at the heart of a national opioid epidemic that killed a record 72,000 Americans last year. His announcement came a week after President Trump asked Mr. Sessions during a cabinet meeting at the White House to sue companies that supplied opioids and to investigate opioid trafficking from China and Mexico, calling the flood of drugs from those countries “almost a form of warfare.” The president, who campaigned on targeting the opioid crisis, has also set a goal to reduce opioid prescriptions by one-third in three years. Among the three cases Mr. Sessions announced Wednesday was a complaint accusing two doctors of illegally prescribing opioids. One of the doctors was also accused of Medicare fraud and of accepting $175,000 in kickbacks from a drug manufacturer. Prosecutors want to deny both doctors the authority to prescribe drugs. Mr. Sessions also said that an Ohio couple was charged with selling fentanyl, an opioid far more powerful than heroin, and other drugs on the so-called dark web, secretive online markets known for sales of drugs, guns and other illicit goods. The couple were the most prolific fentanyl vendors in the United States on the dark web when they were arrested in April, Mr. Sessions said. The couple sold drugs on several markets including AlphaBay, a notorious dark-web market that the Justice Department seized last year. "
1313,"President Trump resumed his attacks on ESPN Wednesday, calling the sports media giant “spineless” in an email to supporters and urging them to sign a petition demanding that the network televise the playing of the national anthem before the N.F.L. games it airs this season. The email came one day after the president, speaking at a rally in West Virginia, criticized ESPN’s decision to not broadcast the playing of the anthem. The comments came at the end of a day of setbacks for the president, as his former personal lawyer pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws and his former campaign chairman was convicted on tax and bank fraud charges. Trump’s email and rally comments were in response to ESPN President James Pitaro, who told reporters last week that the network had informed the N.F.L. it did not plan on televising the playing of the anthem on its “Monday Night Football” telecasts this season. “ESPN has now decided it will no longer play the National Anthem before Monday Night Football,” read the email, which included President Trump’s signature and was sent by the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, a fund-raising group that supports the president’s re-election campaign. The email wasn’t quite correct, though, as ESPN and other networks that televise the N.F.L. have not generally shown the anthem, often airing commercials during that time instead. But as N.F.L. players’ protests of police brutality and social injustice, by kneeling or raising their fists during the national anthem the last two seasons, have ballooned into a dominant narrative around the league, the networks have sometimes shown the anthem live during their broadcasts. ESPN did so on “Monday Night Football” three times last season. ESPN’s position for the upcoming season also largely mirrors that of other N.F.L. rights holders. CBS and Fox also don’t plan on regularly airing the anthem, while NBC has yet to announce their plans. An ESPN spokeswoman declined to comment on the petition. The Trump administration has made a habit of criticizing ESPN. After Jemele Hill, a prominent ESPN personality, tweeted last year that Trump was a white supremacist, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, called the comments a “fireable offense.” Hill was not fired. Trump has also tweeted about ESPN’s ratings and claimed people were dumping the network over its politics, though there is little evidence that ESPN’s subscriber loss or the N.F.L.’s ratings decline are related to players’ kneeling during the national anthem or politics more broadly.

1314,"Dear Charlotte and Fred: Here’s our first memo on your script. The team was excited when we learned you were working on a dystopian drama in which a hack reality TV star gets elected president. Crazy plotline! We’re very interested, but it needs a lot of work. No audience is going to buy the current version. In one five-minute scene you’ve got the president’s big campaign guy getting convicted of a jillion different financial crimes, while at the same time the president’s old lawyer-fixer is admitting that the leader of the free world told him to use hush money to pay off former sex partners. We love scandals, but this is just too, too over the top. Also, while we understand you’re going for laughs, we’re pretty sure there is no such thing as a python-skin coat. We can’t buy the scene where the president goes to a rally right after all these stories break and he’s got the crowd yelling, “Drain the swamp!” This is the same time you’ve got his first two congressional supporters hit by corruption indictments. I know it’s supposed to be irony, but it’s teetering on insanity. However, we don’t want you to drop the congressmen completely. We liked the detail about one orchestrating an insider trade at the White House picnic. And having the other use campaign funds to get a plane ticket for his pet rabbit was a nice touch. Would you think about making it a fuzzy puppy? Then when everybody gets off the plane the puppy could try to lick the president and our hero/villain would recoil. Nothing audiences like better than hating a man who hates dogs. The cast For the lead, we’re wondering if we could talk Liam Neeson into gaining 50 or 60 quick pounds for the part. And maybe a younger Ray Liotta type for the sleazy fixer. "
1315,"Michael D. Cohen wasn’t the only one. The court filing in the case of Mr. Cohen, President Trump’s self-described fixer, indicates for the first time that others at Mr. Trump’s company had a role in the financial arrangements used to silence women who claimed that they had affairs with him, after the hush money payments were made. Two senior Trump Organization executives had involvement in the financial arrangements, according to the 22-page court filing. Separately, one or more members of the 2016 Trump campaign were cited as having worked to identify stories about Mr. Trump’s romantic entanglements “so they could be purchased and their publication avoided,” the filing said. Mr. Cohen, the filing said, “coordinated with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetings and phone calls,” about the nature and timing of the payments, which were made to influence the election. The people are not identified in the documents. It is unclear whether they face any sort of legal risk, but the filing does raise questions about the conduct of the Trump Organization itself. Mr. Cohen paid Stephanie Clifford, an adult film actress, $130,000 to ensure that she would not speak publicly about an affair she said she had with Mr. Trump, and he was then reimbursed through the Trump Organization. "
1316,"MOSCOW — Paul Manafort’s consulting clients before he joined the Trump campaign in 2016 — the leaders of Ukraine’s pro-Russian government — were overthrown in a popular uprising in 2014. Their problems continued this week. Mr. Manafort’s conviction on tax and bank fraud charges has reverberated in Ukraine, where the source of more than $60 million in political consulting fees he received from there had been shrouded in deep secrecy. His trial was “like a fairy tale where all the secrets are revealed,” Mustafa Nayyem, a former investigative journalist and member of Parliament, said in an interview on Wednesday. On Tuesday, shortly before a jury convicted Mr. Manafort, Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Yuri Lutsenko, opened a criminal investigation into Mr. Manafort’s former sponsors in Ukraine. By paying Mr. Manafort while simultaneously serving in government jobs, Mr. Lutsenko said, they are suspected of having violated Ukrainian laws against civil servants managing private businesses. “Therefore, we registered criminal proceedings for alleged violations,” Mr. Lutsenko told journalists in Kiev, Ukraine’s capital. Possible targets of the investigation, he said, include the country’s most prominent businessman, Rinat Akhmetov, a coal and steel magnate who served in Parliament at the time of the payments. Court documents and testimony during Mr. Manafort’s trial in Alexandria, Va., indicated that a former presidential chief of staff, Serhiy Lyovochkin; a former minister of infrastructure, Borys Kolesnikov; a former security council director, Andriy Klyuyev; and a former lawmaker, Serhiy Tihipko; were involved in the elaborate payment schemes that became a focus of the American trial. "
1317,"Casting a lifeline to the sinking coal industry and its shrinking work force, the Trump administration announced on Tuesday a plan to weaken regulations of coal-fired power plants that President Barack Obama had put in place as part of an effort to reduce America’s emissions of planet-warming gases. The plan is wrongheaded on every level. It favors an old, dirty fuel and does nothing to accelerate the push toward the cleaner, renewable fuels on whose development the world is depending for real progress against global warming. It offers another false promise to the coal miners, whose industry is threatened not by some sinister “war on coal,” as President Trump would have it, but by market forces, including plentiful supplies of cleaner natural gas. And it is another sign — the latest of many — that the president has no remorse for abdicating the leadership America once claimed in the struggle against climate change. For good measure, the proposal would also weaken provisions in the clean air laws designed to regulate pollutants like smog and soot and, in so doing, cause as many as 1,400 additional premature deaths annually by 2030, as well as many thousands of respiratory infections because of increases in fine particulate matter linked to heart and lung disease. The Obama plan, finalized in 2015, was designed to help drive down carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, and was a crucial component of Mr. Obama’s pledge at the Paris climate summit meeting in 2015 to reduce America’s overall greenhouse gas emissions by more than one-quarter below 2005 levels by 2025. To that end, it set firm targets for each state, but gave those states wide latitude in deciding how to reach them — improving in energy efficiency, switching from dirty coal to cleaner natural gas, building wind farms, emissions trading among the states. The targets and methods for reaching them were worked out in lengthy, detailed consultation with the states to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach. The Trump plan, by contrast, would not set hard targets and would limit states to basically a single solution, a so-called “inside the fence line” measure aimed solely at improving the efficiency of existing plants. This could provide incentives for some states to keep aging coal-fired plants running, adding millions of tons of pollutants to the atmosphere each year. "
1318,"Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, and his wife, Margaret Hunter, were indicted on Tuesday, accused of spending more than $250,000 in campaign funds on personal expenses — including a vacation to Italy, family dental bills and plane tickets for a pet — and then lying to the Federal Election Commission. The 48-page indictment, handed down by a federal grand jury in San Diego, alleges a pattern of illegal behavior between 2009 and 2016 and makes Mr. Hunter, 41, the second Republican member of Congress to be indicted on corruption charges this month. The first was Representative Chris Collins of New York, who was indicted on charges of insider trading. Mr. Hunter and Mr. Collins were the first members of Congress to endorse the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump. On Wednesday, Mr. Hunter said he believed the indictment was a politically motivated attack. “This is the new Department of Justice,” he told a television news reporter. “This is the Democrats’ arm of law enforcement. That’s what’s happening right now, and it’s happening with Trump and it’s happening with me.” Here are some of the accusations from the indictment of Mr. Hunter. The indictment lays out the context within which prosecutors claim Mr. Hunter and his wife “illegally converted and stole more than $250,000 in Campaign funds to purchase goods and services for their personal use and enjoyment.” "
1319,"BROOKLYN, Iowa — Television cameras had for weeks swarmed this small town in Iowa farm country as the police looked for Mollie Tibbetts, the college student who went for a jog last month and never returned home. After hundreds of tips and interviews, and after countless prayer vigils and donations to a reward fund, investigators got a tragic break in their case on Tuesday. A body believed to be Ms. Tibbetts’s was found buried beneath cornstalks on a farm outside town. The authorities charged Cristhian Rivera, who they said is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, with first-degree murder in her death. President Trump and other conservatives quickly cited the arrest of Mr. Rivera, who worked on a farm owned by a prominent Republican family, as proof of the flawed immigration system and lax border security the president has long warned about. Iowa’s Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, released a statement saying she was “angry that a broken immigration system allowed a predator like this to live in our community.” And the White House Twitter account posted a video with the emotional accounts of people whose family members had been killed by immigrants who entered the country illegally. “Mollie Tibbetts, an incredible young woman, is now permanently separated from her family,” Mr. Trump said Wednesday evening in a Twitter message, a clear reference to his much criticized policy that tried to deter illegal border crossings by separating migrant families. “A person came in from Mexico illegally and killed her. We need the wall, we need our immigration laws changed, we need our border laws changed, we need Republicans to do it because the Democrats aren’t going to do it,” he said. "
1320,"Media coverage of the border crisis has heavily focused on separated parents and children. But migrant children’s nightmares are just beginning once they set foot here, as documented in the video above. Every child that crosses the border without permission has an immigration court case to fight, but there is no right to free counsel in that court. So children, who sometimes speak only an indigenous language, are going up alone against government lawyers to fight to stay in the United States. If that sounds absurd, that’s because it is. Congress has the power to change this. After President Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy went into effect, we at Americans for Immigrant Justice began to see an increase in young children needing legal representation. We thought: How do we get toddlers to understand the gravity of their situation? We created a coloring book to explain to these children their rights. It explains concepts such as what a country is, who is an immigrant and what a judge does. We read the book to separated and unaccompanied children as part of our “know your rights” presentations and have them act out scenarios from the story. The kids in this video op-ed are the lucky ones. They were released from a children’s shelter run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement to family members in Miami. We are representing them in court free. But for many children we engage with at the shelters, the coloring book is the only legal advice they receive. The stakes are high: Over half of all children in immigration court are unrepresented. Nine out of 10 of them will be ordered deported. If we as a country are truly invested in protecting children, the bare minimum that we can do is ensure access to a lawyer for immigrant children who cannot afford one. "
1321,"It has been a bad month for the fight against climate change. Amid heat waves, wildfires, droughts and Arctic ice melt, President Trump has taken aim at the two central pillars of his predecessor’s ambitious efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. After proposing in early August to freeze a scheduled increase in fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks, the Trump administration on Tuesday said it would seek to significantly weaken the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. Those two economic sectors — transportation and electricity production — are the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, accounting for 56 percent of the total. In taking on the Clean Power Plan, Mr. Trump says he wants to save coal, but the reality is that coal is not coming back. Market forces conspire against it. Even without any policy, the economic imperatives driving the transition to cleaner fuels are expected by 2030 to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the power sector by 33 percent of their 2005 levels, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. With the Obama plan, the reduction would be 36 percent; with the Trump administration’s new Affordable Clean Energy Rule, it would be 33 to 34 percent. Coal’s decline is being driven far less by government regulation than by cheap natural gas prices and the falling costs of renewable energy. Therefore, scrapping President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan can’t save coal — although the Trump administration’s misguided plan to subsidize uncompetitive coal plants could, at least in the short term. So why does this proposed rollback of power sector climate regulations matter if it won’t change the carbon emissions trajectory much? First, firm policy direction from the government provides investors and utilities with certainty about the investment outlook and ensures emissions reductions even if the market shifts. Just as few predicted the collapse in natural gas prices a decade ago, there is a wide range of uncertainty about what energy prices will look like in the future. "
1322,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A one-two punch in Washington, political anxiety in Australia and Facebook’s discovery of influence campaigns around the world. Here’s what you need to know: • A grim focus inside the White House. After the conviction of his former campaign chairman and a plea deal by his former personal lawyer and fixer, President Trump mostly avoided the topic at a rally in West Virginia, above. The next morning, he monitored the headlines, sat for an interview with Fox News and discussed ways to try to seize the news cycle again. But the legal setbacks — and the possibility that both defendants might cooperate with the special counsel — have all but collapsed his attempts to dismiss the criminal investigations engulfing his tenure. Even Mr. Trump’s staunchest defenders acknowledge that he could be exposed to the possibility of impeachment. We know it’s a confusing story. Here’s an overview of all the moving parts. _____ • Malcolm Turnbull fights for his job. If the Australian prime minister survives today’s political jockeying in Canberra, he’ll have the two weeks of lawmakers’ recess to regroup. According to this report, he may not make it. Peter Dutton, the right-wing populist who narrowly lost a leadership challenge on Tuesday, could mount another try today. Mr. Turnbull has rejected most of the flurry of resignations from ministers, but the Liberal Party is in obvious crisis. "
1323,"PENN YAN, N.Y. — For the first three weeks of July, Peter Martens prayed for rain. At the end of the month the rain finally arrived, but by then it was too late for some of his crops. For others, it was too much water, too quickly. The lack of rain, Mr. Martens said, will reduce his corn yield by about 20 percent, but the late-summer deluges damaged the quality of his spelt, a type of wheat. New York’s extreme weather this summer, which began with a drought followed by flash flooding, has been enough to make it a difficult season for the state’s farmers. But farmers say President Trump’s trade war and his administration’s crackdown on immigration have made a bad summer far worse. Red numbers are filling farmers’ balance sheets: Mr. Martens’s butternut squash is covered in weeds because he did not have enough workers, at the right time, to hoe the field and now his yield will be far less than he expected. He is also nervous about selling his red kidney beans because higher tariffs abroad threaten to drive down the price as international markets disappear. “There was always something that did well,” Mr. Martens said about the variety of crops on his farm in Penn Yan, N.Y. “Now if nothing does well, what do you do?” "
1324,"Federal Reserve officials are poised to continue gradually raising interest rates but are monitoring for signs of widespread economic fallout from President Trump’s trade policies, according to minutes from the most recent Fed meeting released on Wednesday. The Fed minutes suggest that officials are concerned that Mr. Trump’s tariffs could hurt the current economic recovery but are waiting to see evidence of any damage in the data. Fed officials are also increasingly worried that trouble is brewing in the residential construction market, based on a recent slowdown in home building. For now, however, the Fed shows no signs of deviating from its current path to return interest rates to more historically normal levels, despite Mr. Trump’s recent calls for the central bank to stop raising interest rates. Several officials hinted in the minutes that they are preparing to remove a hallmark phrase of the last decade, one that has indicated the Fed intends to provide support for the economy. Future Fed statements may no longer carry language reading “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative” as rates continue to rise toward a more historically normal level and the Fed continues to wind down its post-crisis economic stimulus. Federal Open Market Committee officials left rates unchanged after the meeting that ended Aug. 1 and laid the groundwork in their post-meeting statement to raise rates in September, the third time this year. Since mid-July, Mr. Trump has used interviews and Twitter to pressure the Fed and its chairman, Jerome H. Powell, to pause the pace of increases, which have left the Fed’s target interest rate between 1.75 percent and 2 percent. Minutes from the meeting revealed no willingness among Fed officials to grant Mr. Trump’s request. Officials “indicated that information gathered since the Committee met in June had not significantly altered their outlook for the U.S. economy,” the minutes reported. “Many participants suggested that if incoming data continued to support their current economic outlook, it would likely soon be appropriate to take another step in removing policy accommodation.” "
1325,"LONDON — The picture was just like many of the other Facebook posts criticizing Britain’s decision to leave the European Union: a fake commemorative stamp showing a person preparing to shoot himself in the foot. But on Tuesday, Facebook revealed that the unremarkable post was anything but. It originated from an Iranian-backed group aimed at Britain, in what the company said was the first known instance of a foreign influence campaign aimed at people outside the United States. Facebook has spent the past two years trying to block foreign propaganda in the United States. But its disclosure of hundreds of fake accounts and pages, including the one tied to the Iranian-backed group, revealed that the foreign manipulation of elections through Facebook extends across the globe. Tactics used by Russia-linked groups ahead of the 2016 presidential election are being applied in Britain, the Middle East and Latin America. Europe, where Facebook has more users than in the United States, is particularly worried. The company’s announcement exacerbated concerns that the region will be a regular target of foreign propaganda efforts — including ahead of next year’s European Parliament elections, which will help set the policy direction in Brussels for the next five years. The discovery immediately added momentum in Europe to pass new laws to clamp down on social media platforms, including rules to remove terrorist content and to restrict how voters are targeted with political messages online. Vera Jourova, a European commissioner who has been involved in writing new election regulations for the entire region, said, “We need to do more to protect our elections and tackle the online challenges to elections head on.” In a statement, Ms. Jourova promised election rules would be introduced in the next few months, ahead of the European Parliament elections in May. "
1326,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Wednesday ordered the release of a long-secret report that could shed light on whether lawyers working for Ken Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton, violated the law in disclosing information to news organizations. Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, was among the lawyers in Mr. Starr’s office, which was accused by Mr. Clinton’s lawyers of violating grand jury secrecy rules. It is not known whether Mr. Kavanaugh, now a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, was named or criticized in the 1999 report. Judge Royce C. Lamberth, of the Federal District Court in Washington, ordered the National Archives to release the report by Friday afternoon. The Justice Department, in a court filing on Wednesday, told Judge Lamberth that it did not object to the release of the report, which it said “investigates allegations of wrongdoing but ultimately finds no violations.” “With the exception of redactions to protect the privacy of one individual discussed in the report — an individual who is not Judge Brett Kavanaugh — and subject to the ordinary review process of the National Archives, the government does not object to the report’s unsealing,” the Justice Department’s filing said. The report, from a special master appointed by a federal judge, has been the subject of extraordinary secrecy. American Oversight, a liberal watchdog group, asked for its release last week, saying that “Judge Kavanaugh’s potential involvement” in misconduct “is a matter of great public importance and current national debate.” "
1327,A setback for the president.  
1328,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. A grim focus in the White House: The morning after the conviction of Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman, and a guilty plea by Michael Cohen, his former personal lawyer and fixer, President Trump monitored the headlines, sat for an interview with Fox News and discussed ways to try to seize the news cycle again. But the legal setbacks — and the possibility that both defendants might cooperate with the special counsel — have all but collapsed the president’s attempts to dismiss the criminal investigations engulfing his tenure. Even Mr. Trump’s staunchest defenders acknowledge that he could be exposed to the possibility of impeachment. We know it’s a confusing story. Here’s an overview of all the moving parts. _____ 2. The Democratic National Committee said it had warded off an attempt to hack its voter database. The F.B.I. is investigating the attack, which the committee learned of this week, according to two officials. It was not immediately clear who was behind the hack. The committee was hacked in 2016 during the presidential election campaign, and the episode was later traced back to Russia. "
1329,"Investigators in New York issued a subpoena to Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former fixer and lawyer, for documents related to the Donald J. Trump Foundation on Wednesday, an escalation of the Cuomo administration’s investigation into whether the president’s charity violated tax laws. After receiving the subpoena, Mr. Cohen called the investigators in the state Tax Department to ask when they could talk, according to a person with knowledge of the investigation. The subpoena was issued less than a day after Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in Manhattan to charges including campaign finance violations, in the form of payments to two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump, for the “purpose of influencing the election” for president in 2016. It also came amid a continuing war of words between Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a sharp-elbowed Democrat who is said to have presidential aspirations, and Mr. Trump, as both have lobbed personal attacks at each other over Twitter and in speeches. Mr. Cuomo — whose primary opponent, Cynthia Nixon, has accused him of only lukewarm liberalism — has presented himself as a progressive foil to Mr. Trump. The subpoena to Mr. Cohen on Wednesday, issued by the state’s Department of Taxation and Finance, seemed calculated to strike yet another blow — both legal and political — against the president and his inner circle. It seeks documents related to both personal and business federal tax filings, as well as state tax filings, connected to the foundation, according to two senior Cuomo administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about an open investigation. Those documents could include general ledgers, bank statements, invoices and contracts. "
1330,"For all of my opposition to Donald Trump, I have long been skeptical of the political wisdom or evidentiary basis of efforts to impeach him. My reasons: First, being a terrible president and a wretched person are not impeachable offenses. Second, Robert Mueller’s investigation has so far produced evidence that can be interpreted as obstruction of justice, but not as clear proof. Third, impeachment in the House would be unlikely to translate into conviction in the Senate, even if Democrats win both chambers in the fall. Fourth, impeachment without conviction could strengthen Trump politically, much as it did for Bill Clinton after his own 1998 impeachment. And, like it or not, Trump remains popular with tens of millions of Americans. To overturn the results of an election for anything less than unambiguous evidence of criminal behavior is a danger to democracy itself. At least that was my view until this week. Michael Cohen’s guilty plea changes this. The Constitution’s standard for impeachment is “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” The standard is now met. Trump’s longtime fixer acknowledged in court on Tuesday that he violated campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women “in coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office.” That means Trump. That means that, as a candidate, Trump is credibly alleged to have purposefully conspired with Cohen to commit criminal acts. That means the duo did so “for purposes of influencing [an] election for Federal office,” which is the legal definition of a campaign contribution. It also means that, as president, Trump allegedly sought to conceal the arrangement by failing to note in his 2017 financial disclosure forms his reimbursements to Cohen. The president most likely continues to lie to the American people about the nature and purpose of those payments. "
1331,"Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil giant has suspended its plans to go public, a decision that puts on hold what would have been by far the biggest initial offering on record — or perhaps signals its cancellation. The company, Saudi Aramco, and its advisers are instead focusing on buying a stake in Sabic, a huge Saudi chemical producer, people briefed on the matter said Wednesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. The shift in focus to a deal for Sabic, one of the people added, means the earliest that work could resume on a Saudi Aramco stock sale will be late next year. The delay cast more doubt on the future of what is meant to be not just a landmark deal for financial markets but one of the biggest milestones in Saudi Arabia’s history. The kingdom’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, had hoped to use the billions of dollars the I.P.O. would raise to finance his Vision 2030 plan, an ambitious effort to wean his country off its dependence on oil. Among the plan’s expensive elements is the creation of a $500 billion city called Neom, meant to run entirely on clean energy and be serviced by robots. An I.P.O. of Saudi Aramco — which would sell shares on its home Tadawul exchange and another major international stock market — would mean a gusher of fees for all the advisers involved, including the banks and law firms on retainer. Stock exchanges around the world, from New York to London to Tokyo, have sought the prestige of hosting what would be a seminal event for the financial markets. World leaders, including President Trump, have pitched their markets to Prince Mohammed. But the plans to take the state-owned oil monopoly public have been bedeviled by the sheer complexity of the undertaking. Though Prince Mohammed had hoped for a $2 trillion market value for Saudi Aramco, oil industry experts called that too high. And legal advisers have grappled with potentially thorny issues, including the possible pitfalls that could arise from choosing a foreign exchange on which to offer shares. "
1332,"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Before getting to the bigger-picture questions, it’s been a busy week in coal news. Here’s what happened: We learned early details of the Trump administration’s plan to overhaul some Obama-era climate change regulations. And on Monday, the acting head of the Environmental Protection Agency signed a proposal to weaken regulation of coal-fired power plants. The E.P.A.’s own numbers showed how this could lead to as many as 1,400 premature deaths a year by 2030. Then, President Trump had a rally Tuesday night in West Virginia, where he told supporters, “We’re putting our great coal miners back to work.” We fact-checked his claims about coal. And yet, as we wrote today, all this may help a few coal plants in the short term — but still won’t save the coal industry. We also profiled the former industry lawyer who is leading the E.P.A.’s air office, and who, before that, spent the better part of a decade fighting his current employer over air pollution rules. This all raises the question … "

If emissions continue at their current rate, scientists anticipate widespread coastal land loss, agricultural and economic collapse, food and water shortages, frequent and severe natural disasters, and unprecedented refugee crises. For the third installment of our series T Agitprop, we asked 12 contemporary artists, including Alexis Rockman, Mel Chin, Erin Jane Nelson and the members of the collective Dear Climate, to contribute works, most of them new and created exclusively for T, in response to this global emergency.

While this possibility is a long way off, what we do in the present will affect the future and determine the outcome of rising oceans. Studies reveal that electronic devices and internet use impair empathy. Conversely, natural and social tragedies like hurricanes and school shootings can rekindle it and inspire us to act, motivating students to mobilize and strangers to assist strangers. “Unmoored” is a downloadable app that places the phenomenon of rising sea levels within our electronic devices.

The boats occasionally bump into each other, breaking the silence of a surreal floating canopy. Enlarged forms of plankton appear and seem to seek connection with the human audience. Because augmented and mixed reality formats use the real world as backdrops, inserting an apparition of the future on devices puts a phenomenological experience into the hands of the individual. “Unmoored” is a work designed to engender a moment of awe, one that offers a glimpse into the future, witnessed through the technology of the present.

1334,"WAILEA, Hawaii — For the latest on Hurricane Lane and Hawaii, check out Thursday’s live updates. Hawaii was bracing on Wednesday for possible landfall from Hurricane Lane, a rare Category 4 storm in the Pacific Ocean that forecasters are warning could bring whipping winds, flooding and high surf. The storm, which rose to Category 5 strength on Tuesday evening, weakened slightly on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. As of 11 p.m. local time Wednesday, it was about 235 miles south of the island of Hawaii, also known as the Big Island, with wind speeds of 145 miles per hour. Hurricane Lane was expected to turn northward on Friday toward the islands, with the center of the storm moving over land over the next two days, the Weather Service said. While its wind speeds have decreased over the last day, the storm was expected to remain a hurricane if it makes landfall. As the hurricane raced toward Hawaii, the state issued an emergency declaration and closed government offices, including public schools. Tourists and residents were closely following the hurricane’s path and the latest forecasts, with some visitors rushing to airports on Wednesday to try to book flights to leave before the worst of the storm was expected to arrive. But as rain started to fall on Wednesday morning on Maui, Athena Walsh, a taxi driver, was not fazed. She said she was not yet convinced that Hurricane Lane posed a serious threat, noting that only tourists and new residents panic in these situations. “I’ve seen so many hurricane warnings and then it’s a beautiful day,” said Ms. Walsh, who has lived in Hawaii since 1979. “We’re not going to worry and stress about it.” "
1335,"WASHINGTON — The trial of Paul Manafort was not about election conspiracy or presidential obstruction of justice. Michael D. Cohen pleaded guilty to crimes that had nothing to do with Russia’s campaign to sabotage the 2016 presidential race. Yet the deepening legal peril for both men could have significant implications for the current investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. The cases of both men are, at the moment, tangential to the central questions of Mr. Mueller’s inquiry: whether President Trump and his associates conspired with Russia’s election interference, and whether the president tried to obstruct the Justice Department’s investigation into the matter. But neither Mr. Manafort nor Mr. Cohen is believed to be cooperating with the special counsel — situations that could change now that they face years in prison. Whether either man has anything of value to offer Mr. Mueller’s investigators is another question, and experts pointed out that the legal proceedings have dealt significant damage to the credibility of both. The team for Mr. Cohen, the president’s former lawyer, at least, has signaled a willingness to provide information to the special counsel in exchange for some kind of leniency. “Cohen has done everything but shout from the rooftops that he wants to cooperate,” said Ross Garber, a criminal defense lawyer and adjunct professor at Tulane Law School. “I expect the government is interested in what he has to say, and then can evaluate whether there is any value to it.” "
1336,"SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea said on Wednesday that it would press ahead with its plan to open a diplomatic “liaison office” in North Korea this year, dismissing concerns that it was too quickly making overtures to the North Koreans, who have yet to begin dismantling their nuclear weapons program. When South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, held his first summit meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, on April 27, they agreed to establish a joint liaison office — a potential first step toward building formal diplomatic missions — in the North Korean border town of Kaesong. In a speech last Wednesday, Mr. Moon said the opening of the office was imminent. “In a few days,” he said, “an era in which the two Koreas communicate with each other around the clock will commence.” But the conservative political opposition and the conservative news media in the South have since raised fears that Mr. Moon’s government is creating a rift with Washington by advancing inter-Korean relations when North Korea has taken no clear steps toward denuclearization. They also questioned whether fuel oil and electricity, which the South plans to supply the office, would violate United Nations sanctions. South Korea says the liaison office would not violate sanctions because it would provide no economic benefits for the North Korean government and would only help facilitate communications for denuclearization efforts. Washington has so far said only that it wants inter-Korean relations to improve in tandem with efforts to denuclearize the North. On Wednesday, Mr. Moon’s office characterized those concerns as mere “quibbling,” given that 24 nations, including Britain and Germany, operate embassies in Pyongyang, the North’s capital. "

What radio does more than any other medium is it allows you to really get close to your audience. When you do TV, they acknowledge you, they nod their head. But when you do radio, they feel like they know everything about you. They feel like they’re your best friend — or maybe your worst enemy, if they don’t like you. Do you have any theories about why that is? A couple. They hear every emotion that you have. They hear the days you’re really happy, the days you’re really angry, the day you might be without a care in the world. But more than that, they can take you everywhere. They’re in the car with you — on the way to work, on the way home. They can take you with them when they’re lying there ready to go to sleep, when they get up in the morning, when they go to the beach, when they’re on the couch.

n 1957, Robert A. Dahl, a father of modern political science, published a canonical article about the Supreme Court’s “most peculiar position” in American democracy. “Much of the legitimacy of the Court’s decisions rests upon the fiction that it is not a political institution but exclusively a legal one,” Dahl wrote. And yet, “from time to time its members decide cases where legal criteria are not in any realistic sense adequate to the task.” These decisions, among the court’s most momentous, turned on vague or ambiguous words in the Constitution, like “establishment of religion” and “due process of law,” with precedent and expert opinions on both sides. By making these rulings, the court cast itself as a “national policymaker” — and in so doing raised a difficult question: When should the justices, unelected figures in robes, reflect majority will and when should they stand for “Right or Justice” so as to protect minorities from tyranny by the majority? To appraise the court’s performance, Dahl did a statistical analysis of its record of striking down laws enacted by Congress, the elected embodiment, he presumed, of majority will. For the most part, he found that the court didn’t thwart the public over the long term, and he ended with a prediction: “Except for short-lived transitional periods when the old alliance is disintegrating and the new one is struggling to take control of political institutions, the Supreme Court is inevitably a part of the dominant national alliance.” Dahl expressed this confidence at a placid moment in the court’s relationship with the public. Three years earlier, the justices took care to rule unanimously in Brown v. Board of Education, their historic decision to desegregate public schools, and in a follow-up ruling in 1955, they explicitly allowed school districts to proceed slowly rather than ordering precipitous change. The ruling in Brown polled well, and Dahl didn’t foresee the protracted unrest over school integration that was just over the horizon, politicizing a decision that the court tried hard to place above politics. Nor did he anticipate just how thoroughly the Supreme Court would become a site of partisan rancor in the ensuing decades. Today we’re accustomed to thinking of major rulings in fully political terms and expecting fierce conflict over their consequences. The temperature rises whenever it comes time to nominate a new justice, especially when the court’s ideological balance is in play, as it is now, with President Donald Trump’s choice of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy. A conservative Republican president, Ronald Reagan, selected Kennedy. Yet the distance between his appointment and Kavanaugh’s reveals how far the conservative movement has traveled in law and in politics. Unlike Kennedy, Kavanaugh was preapproved by the Federalist Society, founded in 1982 to strengthen the conservative movement’s presence in law schools and the judiciary. The organization has groomed prospective judges and nurtured theories like originalism, which supply a method of constitutional interpretation that has led conservative judges largely to positions they ideologically favor. Last year, the Federalist Society helped Trump triumph with two parts of his base, evangelicals and big business, by contributing to a list of judges presented to him that included Neil Gorsuch, whom the president picked for Antonin Scalia’s empty seat — and who began fulfilling the base’s hopes over the course of his first term. While Kennedy supplied the fifth vote for many conservative victories, he also participated in some of its big steps to the left, specifically in embracing marriage equality and reducing the scope of the death penalty. On abortion, he was a moderating force when conservative colleagues moved to gut Roe v. Wade. And by influencing the reasoning of conservative opinions he joined, Kennedy kept doors open that his colleagues would have closed. Though Kennedy ruled in June against Latino and African-American voters who challenged redistricting plans for congressional and state elections in Texas as a violation of the Voting Rights Act, he did not say that the law’s protections for minority voters should never apply to drawing electoral maps, the position taken by Gorsuch and Justice Clarence Thomas.

onald F. McGahn, the White House counsel, stood in the gilded ballroom of Washington’s Mayflower Hotel last November to address the annual meeting of the Federalist Society. He seemed humbled, even a bit awed to be delivering the Barbara K. Olson Memorial lecture, named after the conservative lawyer who died in the Sept. 11 attacks. Noting some of the legal giants who gave the Olson lecture in years past, McGahn reflected, “You hear names like Scalia, Roberts and Gorsuch and then me; one of those names really is different than the rest.” Unlike previous speakers — to say nothing of many of those to whom he was now speaking — McGahn, himself a member of the Federalist Society, hadn’t attended an Ivy League law school; he went to Widener University, a “second tier” law school in Pennsylvania. He had never held a tenured professorship or boasted an appellate practice, much less a judgeship, that required him to think deeply about weighty constitutional issues; he specialized in the comparably mundane and technical field of campaign finance and election law. “But here we are,” McGahn said to the audience, almost apologetically. In 2015, Donald Trump hired McGahn to be the lawyer for his long-shot presidential campaign. Then, after Trump shockingly won the election, he tapped McGahn, who had proved his talent and loyalty during the campaign, to be White House counsel. Trump, in other words, had made McGahn’s wildest dreams come true. Now, McGahn told the Federalist Society, Trump was going to make their wildest dreams come true, too. The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies, as it is officially known, has played a crucial role in putting conservative jurists on the bench. As White House counsel, McGahn is responsible for helping Trump select his judicial nominees. And, as he explained in his speech that November afternoon, he had drawn up two lists of potential judicial appointments. The first list consisted of “mainstream folks, not a big paper trail, the kind of folks that will get through the Senate and will make us feel good that we put some pragmatic folks on the bench.” The second list was made up of “some folks that are kind of too hot for prime time, the kind that would be really hot in the Senate, probably people who have written a lot, we really get a sense of their views — the kind of people that make some people nervous.” The first list, McGahn said, Trump decided to “throw in the trash.” The second list Trump resolved “to put before the U.S. Senate” for a confirmation vote. The president, McGahn assured his audience, was “very committed to what we are committed to here, which is nominating and appointing judges that are committed originalists and textualists.” As White House counsel, McGahn has exercised an unprecedented degree of control over judicial appointments. In previous White Houses, both Republican and Democrat, judicial nominations were typically crowdsourced among officials from different parts of the administration. Under George W. Bush, for instance, there was a judicial-selection committee made up of people from the offices of the White House counsel, political affairs and legislative affairs, as well as officials from the Justice Department. This tended to produce a leveling effect. “You killed nominees by committee,” says one Republican involved in judicial confirmations. Under Trump, the job belongs exclusively to the White House Counsel’s Office, with McGahn and his deputy, Robert Luther, and about 10 associate counsels identifying and then scrutinizing candidates. This process is unique in White House history. Instead of engaging in the typical legislative horse-trading for nominating judges — promising a senator, for instance, that the president will support the nomination of the lawyer who served as the senator’s campaign-finance chairman in exchange for a yes vote on the administration’s agriculture bill — the Trump White House has given the counsel’s office near-absolute authority. In a White House known for chaos and dysfunction, the counsel’s office, under McGahn, is generally viewed as an island of competence. “The White House is like a Dante’s ‘Inferno’-strange comedy,” says one leading conservative lawyer who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, “but the people in the counsel’s office are like the A-Team.” That many of the lawyers in the counsel’s office are also Federalist Society members — as elite Republican lawyers today often are — has given McGahn a handy rebuttal to the complaint that Trump has outsourced his judicial-selection process to the group. “Frankly,” McGahn has said, “it seems like it’s been insourced.” While Trump has lagged behind other presidents in political appointments, the streamlining of the judicial-selection process has helped him deliver a historic number of judges to the federal bench. In 2017, the Senate confirmed 12 of Trump’s appeals court picks — the most for any president in his first year in office. This year, the Senate has already confirmed 12 appellate judges and, according to a Republican Judiciary Committee aide, hopes to confirm at least four more. The White House refers to every new batch of judicial appointees Trump selects as “waves” — in early June, it announced the “Fifteenth Wave of Judicial Nominees”— as if they’re soldiers landing on the beaches of Normandy. [Read more on Trump’s Supreme Court nominees list.] Trump’s appointees have tended to be unusually well credentialed and conservative. Republicans like to emphasize their academic and professional bona fides — the summa cum laudes, the Phi Beta Kappas, the Supreme Court clerks — and jokingly celebrate their “deep bench” of candidates. Democrats, for their part, prefer to focus on the appointees’ ideology. “If someone had said or written something half as controversial as these Trump nominees, they never would have been picked by President George W. Bush,” says Kristine Lucius, a former Democratic Senate Judiciary Committee aide and now the executive vice president for policy at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “What once would have been disqualifying” — a nominee’s stated views on contraception or gay rights or consumer protection — “is now motivating this president.” Or perhaps, the nominees’ views are what’s motivating many conservatives to go along with Trump’s presidency — which is what’s motivating Trump. When it comes to Trump’s judicial appointments, the public has been understandably focused on the Supreme Court, with first Neil Gorsuch and now Brett Kavanaugh receiving most of the attention. When one of Trump’s lower-court nominees has managed to penetrate public consciousness, it has usually been an outlier, like Brett Talley, whom Trump picked last year for an Alabama Federal District Court judgeship. Talley, who had never tried a case and whom the American Bar Association rated unanimously “not qualified,” ultimately withdrew his nomination after it was discovered that he was a member of a ghost-hunting group and had apparently defended the honor of the early Ku Klux Klan on an Alabama Crimson Tide football fan message board.

1340,"The party has been going for nearly a decade. But a lot of Americans haven’t been celebrating. Stocks crossed a major threshold on Wednesday, when the current bull market arguably became the longest on record. It ranks among the great booms in American market history. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index has soared more than 320 percent since emerging from the rubble of the financial crisis in March 2009, creating more than $18 trillion in wealth. But the gains haven’t been spread among the masses. Stock market wealth is heavily concentrated among the richest families. As the stock market surged, prices for homes — the most important source and store of wealth for the American middle class — recovered much more slowly from the Great Recession and housing bust. Incomes, too, have only recently surpassed pre-crisis levels, despite steady economic growth in recent years. “This is the decade in which wealth inequality has increased the most in U.S. history,” said Moritz Schularick, a professor of economics at the Bonn Graduate School of Economics in Germany who has written about the distribution of wealth in the United States. “The driver has been the very unequal gains in the very sharp performance of the stock market relative to the sharp drop of the housing market.” "
1341,"WASHINGTON — America’s ailing coal industry was buoyed on Tuesday when the Environmental Protection Agency unveiled a proposal to relax pollution regulations on coal-fired power plants. President Trump traveled to West Virginia to tout the planned measure, telling supporters, “We’re putting our great coal miners back to work.” Yet the reality on the ground for the nation’s coal industry remains bleak. Even the Trump administration’s own numbers suggest that its latest proposal won’t reverse the sharp decline of coal power, which has been crushed by competition from cheaper natural gas and renewable energy over the past decade. More than 200 coal plants have shut down since 2010, and another 40 plants have announced they will close in the years ahead, with virtually no new coal plants being built today. At best, if finalized, the E.P.A.’s newest rollback could help a small number of those endangered coal plants stave off retirement for a bit longer, albeit at the expense of increased air pollution. But even in that scenario, the agency’s own analysis showed, coal power would still decline by 20 percent between now and 2030 and coal mining would drop by one-third. [The E.P.A. said the new rules could lead to as many as 1,400 more deaths a year.] “This is like throwing a few snowballs into a blizzard,” said Tom Sanzillo, director of finance at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “You might see a plant here or a plant there that benefits from the new rules. But we’re talking about very minor changes compared with the significant gap between the cost of coal and the cost of natural gas.” The E.P.A. is planning to repeal the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, which was originally conceived as a sweeping climate change regulation that would push electric utilities to move away from coal and toward cleaner gas and renewables in order to cut carbon dioxide emissions. "
1342,"When planning a family trip to Montenegro last spring, I found myself telling perplexed friends who knew next to nothing about the Balkan country: “Imagine yourself in Venice, sail down the Adriatic coast, look east and stop before you reach Albania.” But since President Trump described the country, in a Fox News interview in July, as likely to trigger World War III and Montenegrins as “very aggressive,” the questions have trended from “Where is it?” to “What’s there?” For starters, there is dramatic natural beauty, including the imposing mountains that wall the coast and inspired 15th-century Venetians to name it Monte Negro, or Black Mountain. More invested in tourism — which accounts for over 20 percent of the economy — than war, Montenegro attracted two million visitors last year, more than three times its population, according to the national tourism office. A statement from the government in reaction to Mr. Trump’s characterization cited Montenegro’s “peaceful politics,” noting that during the Balkan Wars of the 1990s, the country was “the only state in which the war didn’t rage during disintegration of the former Yugoslavia,” of which it was a part. "
1343,"WASHINGTON — Senior Republican Party leaders began urging their most imperiled incumbents on Wednesday to speak out about the wrongdoing surrounding President Trump, with Representative Tom Cole, a former House Republican campaign chairman, warning, “Where there’s smoke, and there’s a lot of smoke, there may well be fire.” Democrats face their own pressure to shed their cautious midterm strategy and hammer the opposition for fostering what Democratic leaders are labeling “a culture of corruption” that starts at Mr. Trump and cascades through two indicted House Republicans to a series of smaller scandals breaking out in the party’s backbenches. One day after Michael D. Cohen, the president’s former lawyer, implicated Mr. Trump in payoffs to two women before the 2016 election, and the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted of eight felonies, Republicans were concerned that the worst may be to come in the House, although the party’s senators expressed few worries. By urging some candidates to speak out or at least stay silent, Republican leaders who gravely fear losing control of the House risked opening the first significant rift between the Trump White House and the Republican-controlled Capitol. “Anybody who says this is not disturbing is not being honest,” said Mr. Cole, an Oklahoman and the former head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, adding, “so my advice to any candidate would be: Keep your powder dry and don’t rush to attack or defend anybody because you just don’t know enough to have a reaction that you can still defend three months from now.” On cue, Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida, called the accumulation of Trump-related scandals a “sad chapter in our country’s politics” and said that “no one is above the law.” Mr. Curbelo, in a tough re-election fight, also reproached the president for his caustic attacks on the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. "
1344,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump was dealt double legal setbacks on Tuesday, as his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, implicated him in a federal crime, and his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty of bank and tax fraud. Here’s a quick look at what happened, and at what comes next. In pleading guilty to breaking campaign finance laws and other charges, Mr. Cohen told a judge in Manhattan that Mr. Trump had directed him to arrange payments to two women during the 2016 campaign, to keep them from speaking publicly about affairs they said they had with Mr. Trump. “I participated in this conduct, which on my part took place in Manhattan, for the principal purpose of influencing the election,” Mr. Cohen said. Here’s our full story about his day in court, as well as six takeaways from the guilty plea. • Mr. Cohen has implicated Mr. Trump in serious crimes, but the Justice Department has long said that sitting presidents are not subject to criminal prosecution. Prosecutors could take other actions, however, including presenting evidence to the House for impeachment proceedings. • News from Alexandria, Va., on Tuesday was no better for President Trump: His former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was convicted on eight of 18 fraud charges in a politically charged case that had riveted Washington. "
1345,"On Tuesday, Michael Cohen, President Trump’s former consigliere and a man who had a talent for ostentatious indifference, walked into federal court and pleaded guilty to eight felonies. Remember during the election when he was confronted on CNN with dismal polls suggesting his candidate was losing, and he scoffed, “Says who?” That time his bravado was warranted. But his appearance before a judge was a remarkable reversal of fortune for the man who styled himself Mr. Trump’s attack dog and fixer, a man quick with a threat of a libel suit or a promise to destroy journalists who vexed him or his boss. Mr. Cohen was forced to abase himself before a roomful of reporters, admitting to a wide range of serious wrongdoing, including tax evasion and bank fraud — while also directly implicating the president of the United States in federal campaign finance violations. This preposterous age of manic news cycles — Mr. Cohen’s admission came on the same day that Paul Manafort, the president’s former campaign chairman, was convicted of eight counts of tax and bank fraud — weekly bombshells and improbable politics has left us deadened to amazing developments. So let me repeat it for emphasis and for history: The president’s personal lawyer pleaded guilty to a federal crime and testified under oath that the president told him to do it. In the most explosive admissions, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to committing two federal campaign finance violations on behalf of — and, according to Mr. Cohen, testifying under oath, “in coordination with and at the direction of” — President Trump. The charging document describes a scheme to pay off Karen McDougal, the former Playboy model, and the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels to buy their silence about their claims of affairs with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen admitted to arranging for American Media, Inc. — publisher of The National Enquirer — to pay Ms. McDougal $150,000 to keep her story quiet to protect the Trump campaign, thus causing a prohibited corporate campaign contribution. Mr. Cohen also admitted to arranging to pay Ms. Daniels $130,000 for her silence. Because the payment was intended to influence the election by protecting Mr. Trump, this constituted an illegal contribution far in excess of the personal contribution limits. Mr. Trump’s involvement wasn’t a necessary element to Mr. Cohen’s plea, but he supplied it anyway. That implicates the president directly in what might be called “collusion”: a conspiracy to commit a series of federal crimes, albeit not, in this case anyway, with Russians. "
1346,"President Trump may not be up for re-election until 2020, but since May 31, the Trump Make America Great Again Committee — his re-election campaign — has spent $629,500 on advertising on Google platforms alone, making it the top spender on political ads on Google platforms. That’s nearly $200,000 more than the No. 2 spender, One Nation, a right-wing organization focused on influencing Senate elections. This information comes from Google, which just increased transparency into political ad spending on its platforms. Anyone skilled in marketing knows the precision, targeting and cost-effectiveness of online strategies to reach buyers, influencers and, in this case, voters. When I was the chief marketing officer of Salesforce a few years ago, the industry standard was to allocate 25 percent to 30 percent of marketing budget to digital channels, and that allocation has increased since then across all industries. Last year, for the first time, global ad spending on digital channels eclipsed traditional TV spending. By 2020, digital is expected to account for over 50 percent of all ad spending. And then there are the Democrats: The average nonpresidential Democratic campaign spends only 10 percent to 15 percent of its budget on digital channels while pouring 60 percent to 70 percent of its budget into television ads and direct mail. That is shocking, especially because people now spend an average of 5.9 hours online every single day, with 3.3 of those hours on mobile devices. So why are Democratic campaigns ignoring such obvious opportunities to engage with voters? I’m honestly not sure; perhaps old habits are hard to break. But outdated models aren’t going to win in this digital world. Unlike the Democrats, Republican candidates and right-wing organizations are prioritizing the right channels. In the average 2016 Senate general election, Republicans outspent Democrats by a three-to-one ratio on YouTube, AdWords and other Google channels. From January to June, during the primaries, this gap was even wider at 20 to one. It’s even worse for down-ballot, state-level campaigns, which are under-resourced in both manpower and financial support. A typical state legislative campaign might run with an average budget of $150,000 (just 10 percent of the budget of a successful federal House race). With a smaller budget, you need to be intentional and efficient. Why spend money on TV ads, which are often aired beyond your voting district or skipped entirely with DVRs, when you could be utilizing Google AdWords and Facebook ads that can zero in on specific ZIP codes and target voters by segment or even language? "
1347,"Good morning on this stormy Wednesday. Elon Musk is overworked. In a recent emotional interview with The New York Times, Mr. Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, choked up multiple times and said, “This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career.” “It’s not been great, actually,” he added. “I’ve had friends come by who are really concerned.” Mr. Musk said that he had been working up to 120 hours a week. (That’s more than 17 hours a day.) He may not be a New Yorker, but his workaholic nature is prevalent in a city where the average person works or commutes more than 49 hours a week, according to a 2015 report by the city comptroller. That’s longer than workers in the next 29 largest cities in the United States. And that doesn’t count those of us who take work home. With that in mind, we spoke to Anat Lechner, a business professor at the New York University Stern School of Business, about mental health in the workplace and how to avoid hitting a breaking point. What are some of the signs that a colleague is hitting a breaking point? The signs are usually emotional. “You can see people get angry, short, and start to resent the people who don’t work as hard,” Ms. Lechner said. Another telltale sign: sloppiness. But it’s important to understand what messy work means, she added. “People who become overburdened, and therefore become sloppy, are usually your best employees. Weak employees drop off the bus quickly. The best employees are the people who get assigned more and more work. An overburdened employee is a reflection of bad management.” "

Welcome to China’s “consumption downgrade” culture, a potentially worrisome development for Beijing and the world. For years, the conversation in China was about “consumption upgrades.” As the economy took off, China’s middle class — now more than 400 million strong and still growing — decided to spend those bigger paychecks. It traded up from local brands to Nikes, from cheap phones to iPhones, from tea to $5 Starbucks lattes. Today, China’s economy is slowing, and shopping has slowed with it. The stock market is slumping. China’s currency has lost some of its value. The trade war with President Trump has left many Chinese feeling pessimistic. China’s consumer culture has by no means ground to a halt. But in the streets and on the Chinese internet, the talk is about cutting back in ways big and small. Quit avocado. Ride bikes instead of taxis. Drink beer instead of cocktails — and make sure that beer isn’t craft. Order a medium-size milk tea instead of a large. Give up the gym, and take up dancing in public squares like a grandmother. Some people joke about eating meat instead of tofu, as American tariffs have made imported soybeans more expensive. Perhaps most worrisome for China’s leaders, many young Chinese are increasingly reluctant to have children. "
1350,"Within a few whirlwind minutes on Tuesday, major developments were revealed in the cases of two associates of President Trump. Michael D. Cohen pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws, saying he committed them at the direction of Mr. Trump, and Paul Manafort was convicted on multiple counts of fraud. Confused or overwhelmed by the developments? Here’s a look at what happened. Or, you can listen to Wednesday's episode of The Daily on the meaning of Tuesday’s revelations. On Tuesday, Mr. Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws, and admitted to arranging payments to two women at Mr. Trump’s behest to secure their silence about affairs they said they had with him. Mr. Cohen said the payments were made “for the principal purpose of influencing the election.” More details: • You can watch here how Mr. Cohen, once named Mr. Trump’s “pit bull,” turned on him. • Read about the tense and somber hearing in the courtroom and watch a video of Mr. Cohen leaving court. • The documents filed in Mr. Cohen’s case also laid out how it all began: in the world of supermarket tabloids. "
1351,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) A good deal of thought went into the top-two nonpartisan primary system that was approved by California voters in 2010. It passed with the support of some high-profile politicians (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and no shortage of academics. The idea was that an open primary in June with the top two finishers — regardless of party — facing off in November would take the partisanship out of elections. But if history has shown anything, it’s that it is difficult to predict how so-called electoral reforms might play out. That is especially true if the unexpected happens. So it was that on Tuesday, Representative Duncan Hunter, a Republican seeking re-election in Southern California, was indicted along with his wife on charges of misusing $250,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses. In a year when Democrats are making an all-out assault on Republican-held congressional seats in California, Mr. Hunter was viewed as one of the longer-shot targets — unless he was indicted (it was known that he was under investigation). His opponent is Ammar Campa-Najjar, 28, who worked in Barack Obama’s White House and is making his first bid for major office. In a more traditional political system, the Republican Party would step in, nudge Mr. Hunter out, and replace him with a more palatable candidate. Officeholders have certainly been known to get indicted. But it appears no one planned for this eventuality in drafting the top-two system. “There exists no process in California elections code for Duncan Hunter to remove his name from the November ballot (or replace him),” said Sam Mahood, a spokesman for the secretary of state. "
1352,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday praised his just-convicted former campaign chairman for refusing to “break” and cooperate with federal prosecutors investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, expressing appreciation for the personal loyalty of a felon found guilty of defrauding the United States government. In a series of tweets the morning after an extraordinary day in which Paul Manafort, his former campaign chief, was convicted of tax and bank fraud and his longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations he said were directed by Mr. Trump, the president appeared to suggest he was more concerned with the fallout for himself than with the crimes. He compared Mr. Cohen unfavorably with Mr. Manafort, attacking Mr. Cohen as a bad lawyer who had caved to pressure from biased federal prosecutors while lauding Mr. Manafort as a “brave man” with a “wonderful family” who had stood strong. “‘Justice’ took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to ‘break’ — make up stories in order to get a ‘deal,’” Mr. Trump wrote, his quotation marks suggesting his disdain for the Justice Department. The president played down the wrongdoing by both men, noting that the jury in Mr. Manafort’s case convicted him of eight counts of fraud but did not reach a conclusion on 10 other charges. "
1353,"BEIJING — The video released by the Chinese state media thanks President Trump for helping make China stronger. It shows him in unflattering poses, his brow furrowed and his mouth agape. Its sarcastic title: “Thanks Mr. Trump, you are GREAT!” As a trade war between China and the United States escalates, Chinese news outlets have largely refrained from leveling personal attacks against Mr. Trump. But a new video released this week by China Global Television Network, an English-language affiliate of the state broadcaster, took direct aim at the American leader, portraying him as a bumbling man indirectly advancing China’s interests. And then, as quickly as it began attracting attention, it was gone, pulled from YouTube and Weibo, the Chinese microblogging platform. The video reflected the escalating anger in China over the tariffs of as much as 25 percent imposed on tens of billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods, including steel, aluminum and a variety of technology products. “They sense his increasing domestic weakness and see a chance to pile pressure on,” said Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese politics at King’s College London. Still, Mr. Brown added that the criticism would probably be muted to avoid provoking a backlash in the United States. And it indeed appeared that China’s propaganda officials had second thoughts. Mr. Trump has described the tariffs as necessary to reduce the United States’ trade deficit with China. But his efforts have rattled Chinese officials and prompted a series of retaliatory actions from Beijing, which fears slowing economic growth. Chinese news outlets, which are tightly controlled by the ruling Communist Party, often criticize the United States in general terms. But in recent months, commentators have shown a greater willingness to invoke Mr. Trump’s name directly, accusing him of making misleading statements and resorting to “childish tactics.” It’s not the first time that China Global Television Network, which is geared toward a foreign audience, has taken aim at Mr. Trump. A video from early August depicts Mr. Trump sitting on a toilet. An announcer describes Mr. Trump as a septuagenarian who “can sit on his toilet at 5 in the morning and post a tweet that makes you question his sanity.” The video released this week was the latest salvo in a battle for public opinion. In the video, a business news anchor, Cheng Lei, reads a long-winded thank-you note to Mr. Trump. Among other things, Ms. Cheng credits him with helping China lure foreign investors like Tesla and with inspiring China to devote more financing to research in the semiconductor industry. The video, nearly three minutes long, mocks Mr. Trump for running a chaotic White House and pursuing an isolationist foreign policy. Ms. Cheng also suggests, tongue in cheek, that by prompting China to impose tariffs on American products, Mr. Trump is helping to improve public health. “On behalf of doctors,” Ms. Cheng says, “thank you for pointing out the need to wean off American goods like bourbon and bacon.” "
1354,"Michael Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, lies a lot. That’s one thing we learned when he pleaded guilty to an array of crimes that became public on Tuesday. In the process, he also indicated that the president had instructed him to pay two women to keep them from telling their stories about Trump. The glee of the president’s critics is pulsating brightly. They are vindicated. Or so they think. But did Cohen’s appearance in court change anyone’s mind about Trump? I doubt it. I’ll have more to say about this soon, but it’s already causing me to reflect on the disservice we do ourselves with our obsessive focus on scandal. It wasn’t helpful when Republicans ceased doing the country’s business two decades ago to hound President Bill Clinton about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, and it isn’t helpful now. Think of the issues we face that require the government’s full attention. We learned on Tuesday, for example, that Microsoft caught the Russian military attempting to hack the websites of conservative think tanks; the United States continues to put American lives at risk in low-intensity wars in Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen, without a clear strategic goal or measure of victory; and an aggressive, self-confident China is building islands in the South China Sea for military bases from which it can control crucial trade routes. When we’re not focused on the gory details of illicit but consensual sex between adults, we’re obsessing over gossipy West Wing intrigue. I’m exhausted — and bored — by the psychodramas that occupy an unnaturally large part of our attention. Is it just me? You might be tempted to think, knowing my political sensibilities, that this is a thinly veiled attempt to shame President Trump’s critics into silence. It isn’t. I had the same view during the Obama years, when we had to endure apocryphal stories about whether he was born in Kenya, notably from Trump himself when he was still Citizen Trump. If you disagree with the president’s plan to renegotiate trade deals on terms more favorable to the United States or his attempts to get NATO members to pay their fair share or anything else he wants to do, by all means say so. But this voyeuristic focus on petty personal corruption is a harmful distraction. Trump’s dalliances are a sideshow. So were Bill Clinton’s “bimbo eruptions.” As a largely apolitical friend of mine likes to say of such scandals, “How does this affect me?” That’s what a lot of people ask. What political types fail to understand is that many Americans don’t hold our elected representatives in very high regard or look to them for moral example. We see them more as contractors hired to do a job. "
1355,"Good Wednesday. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. President Trump’s White House has been dealt its most serious blows yet. The guilty plea by Michael Cohen, his former personal lawyer, and the conviction of Paul Manafort, his former campaign manager, will rock the administration. Especially damaging: Mr. Cohen’s admission to paying a porn star hush money at Mr. Trump’s request, apparently violating campaign finance laws. How much will that hurt Mr. Trump’s ability to govern — and to continue deregulating business? Well, legal and political experts agree that Robert Mueller probably won’t seek to indict Mr. Trump while he is in office, and that lawmakers  are likely to shy away from impeachment. But all eyes are on his allies in Congress. Mr. Trump, Jonathan Bernstein of Bloomberg Opinion argues, is now “an unusually weak president.” The rewards of helping and protecting him may be shrinking. Today, stocks will cross a threshold: The nearly 10-year-old bull market will arguably become the longest on record. (The argument’s about rounding.) Matthew Phillips of the NYT explains why that matters, and why not all Americans will be celebrating: The social network has identified several new campaigns to mislead people around the world and removed 652 fake accounts, pages and groups trying to sow misinformation. Facebook says that this time the activity originated in Iran and Russia, and targeted Latin America, Britain and the Middle East, as well as America. "
1356,"Air pollution is shaving months — and in some cases more than a year — off your life expectancy, depending on where you live, according to a study published Wednesday. Worldwide, outdoor air pollution reduces the average life expectancy at birth by one year. The effect is much more pronounced in some countries: It cuts the average Egyptian’s life span by 1.9 years and the average Indian’s by 1.5 years. In Russia, it’s around nine months. For the United States, it’s less, currently reducing the life expectancy of an American born today by a little more than four months on average. Those findings come as the Trump administration is proposing a loosening of pollution controls from coal-fired power plants. The administration proposal, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency this week, would replace the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which aimed to steer the energy sector away from coal and toward cleaner energy sources. By the E.P.A.’s own calculations, the Trump administration’s plan could lead to up to 1,400 premature deaths annually. The study, in the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters, took into account measurements of outdoor, or ambient, air pollution. It gathered data from previous studies that used satellites and ground-based pollution meters to calculate levels of ambient fine particulate matter, known as PM 2.5. "
1357,"Hardly a day goes by without President Trump being accused of breaking a presidential norm or two, doing something that no president has ever done — nor, it’s implied, ever ought to do. He tweets. He runs down the F.B.I., the intelligence community, his own attorney general. He makes fun of other politicians. He hires and fires cabinet secretaries, lawyers and communications people with abandon. He revokes a former C.I.A. director’s security clearance. He fails to disclose his tax returns. He picks his Supreme Court nominees from a list prepared by outside groups. He alternately threatens and sweet talks foreign despots. Guilty as charged — but so what? All norms are not created equal. Hence breaking norms is neither good nor bad except as the norms themselves are good or bad. We elect presidents partly to separate the wheat from the chaff: to energize government by shedding or retiring norms that no longer serve the public good, and by adopting fresh ones that do. Habits, conventions and unwritten rules of the road are, of course, important to American democracy. Our national government began life as a terse written agreement, the Constitution. Once it was ratified, the immediate task was to put flesh on the bare bones of Articles I, II and III, which called for three branches of a new government (the Congress, presidency and judiciary, respectively). This required, among other things, holding national elections for the House, asking the state legislatures to choose senators and firing up the Electoral College to name a president. Once in office, however, these politicians had to figure out how to conduct themselves in their new roles. The Constitution left it largely up to them, by a combination of written laws and unwritten customs and habits, to develop the culture of constitutionalism that it needed to endure and to fulfill its promise of good government. The resulting formal and informal norms helped both to grease the wheels of government and to legitimate them over time. The “founding” was about this secondary process of passing statute laws and establishing customs, almost as much as it was about devising and ratifying the Constitution. The Congress spent a month debating how to address the executive. “Mr. President” won out (John Adams had suggested “Your Highness” as well as “Your Most Benign Highness”). How many justices should sit on the Supreme Court? Five or six would do, Congress decided; but it remains free to change the number, and nine is now customary. "
1358,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Capitol Hill grapples with legal drama, Saudi Arabia seeks an unusual execution and European lawmakers worry about Facebook. Here’s the latest: • Disarray in D.C. A day after President Trump’s former campaign manager was convicted of fraud and his personal lawyer pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, the White House grappled with developments that may seriously threaten Mr. Trump’s presidency. Possible outcomes include impeachment or indictment. In Congress, Republicans were shaken by the two cases and what they could mean for the midterm elections. Senior party leaders even urged candidates to speak out about the wrongdoing surrounding the president to protect themselves, creating the first real rift between the White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill. One case even reverberated across borders. Paul Manafort’s conviction on tax and bank fraud charges prompted Ukraine to open an investigation into his political consulting clients there. Separately, in the U.S., the Democratic National Committee said it was alerted of an attempted hack of its voter database. The last time the D.N.C. was hacked, in 2016, the episode was traced to Russia. This time, however, the identities of the culprits are unclear. "
1359,"SHANGHAI — As China’s economy slows and the trade war with the United States intensifies, Beijing’s economic bosses are swinging into action. Chinese officials are pushing banks to lend more and allowing indebted local governments to spend money on big projects again. They have moved to shore up the value of the country’s currency. They have also helped out the stock market, say financial analysts, as the government works to avert a stock market collapse like the one three years ago that shook the world. “It’s a line in the sand for the leadership” of China, said Hao Hong, the research director for the international operations of the Bank of Communications, a Shanghai-based financial institution. China is taking action as its problems mount. On Thursday the United States formally enacted its previously threatened tariffs on $16 billion in Chinese-made goods. Beijing said it would immediately retaliate with its own tariffs and file a complaint with the World Trade Organization. The moves intensify a trade war that has already affected more than $100 billion of goods and cast a shadow over growth prospects for China and the world. China is playing a difficult game. It must deal with its weakening economy without worsening its onerous debt problems. At the same time, it has to shore up the situation at home if it hopes to continue to retaliate against President Trump’s trade war broadsides. "
1360,"BEIJING — The fog of cyberespionage concerns surrounding Huawei has for years kept the Chinese technology giant largely out of the United States. Now it has cost the company potentially lucrative business in another country: Australia. Huawei said on Thursday that the Australian government had barred it and another Chinese company, ZTE, from providing equipment to support the country’s new telecommunications networks. Mobile carriers around the world have been preparing to build infrastructure using fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless technology, which promises to enable the ultrafast communications necessary for technologies such as self-driving cars. On Twitter, Huawei called the decision an “extremely disappointing result for consumers.” In a statement, the company said it “will continue to engage with the Australian government, and in accordance with Australian law and relevant international conventions, we will take all possible measures to protect our legal rights and interests.” A ZTE spokeswoman declined to comment. Huawei, one of the world’s largest makers of telecom gear and smartphones, already sells equipment to major Australian telecom carriers. The company wrote to Australian lawmakers recently, arguing that concerns that its gear could be used by the Chinese government for spying were “ill informed and not based on facts.” But in a statement on Thursday, two Australian ministers indicated that the government would move to exclude certain equipment vendors from the nation’s 5G networks. Companies that “are likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government” pose unacceptable security risks, the ministers said. "
1361,"Readers respond to the 8.12.18 issue. RE: War Without End C.J. Chivers wrote about the Pentagon’s failed campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. This moving piece describes the war in Afghanistan at the grunt level and takes aim at senior officers for failures in Iraq and Afghanistan. In fact, both our national political leadership and senior military officials have failed to craft an overarching strategy and set of strategic goals and objectives commensurate with the valor and perseverance of our men and women in uniform (and in the intelligence community) who have borne the fight for all of these years. This failure has cost us many lives and much treasure. Less visibly, it also has come with a great opportunity cost. To wit, I have heard senior Pentagon leaders complain that while the United States and its allies have been “playing kids’ soccer” in Iraq and Afghanistan, China and Russia have been preparing for 21st-century conflict by investing in cyber, space capabilities, advanced computing and artificial intelligence. Brian J. Morra, former United States Air Force officer and retired senior aerospace and defense executive I was deployed to Afghanistan one year before my retirement from the Air Force. During one of our movements, a quiet pause came over the armored vehicle. While all of us were staring out the windows, one of the guys asked why we were even there. Our commander softly responded, “So our kids don’t have to come back.” Sadly, it seems, that is not the case, as this article points out. My confidence in our country’s decision to be in Afghanistan wavered while I was there and has only gotten worse as I watch the years of waste accumulate. Joe Osborne, Ruston, La. No politician, especially an American president, wants to be blamed for losing a war. Lyndon Johnson was haunted by the fate of President Harry S. Truman, who was accused of “losing” China by his Republican enemies. So Johnson agreed to keep sending more troops to Vietnam, knowing that victory in any meaningful sense was impossible, but hoping to keep the lid on until after the 1968 presidential election. Of course, President Johnson’s plan didn’t work out. The Tet Offensive began in January 1968, and it was all downhill for his presidency from there. Chivers makes clear that the same lack of political leadership accounts for the endless wars in which the United States is still engaged in Afghanistan and Iraq. It’s instructive to recall that the war in Vietnam only ended when the United States Congress refused to continue to fund it. John E. Stafford, Rye, New York "
1362,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. — When Doug Jones won a Senate seat in Alabama last December, many Democrats celebrated the outcome as a watershed, while Republicans saw it as a blip. Who turns out to be correct will depend on when their answers are graded. Less than a year after Alabama surprised itself by electing its first Democratic senator in a quarter-century, Republicans are primed to reassert what they regard as the state’s hard-won political order. And the Democrats, though emboldened and enchanted by Mr. Jones’s victory, are only beginning to rebuild the long-atrophied political muscles they need to compete. “This year, you’re not going to see a giant blue wave coming across the state of Alabama,” Mr. Jones said in an interview. “But there are opportunities in the state where we can make some strides.” The stakes this autumn for both parties, and the state as a whole, are significant. With a few exceptions, every statewide elected office will be on the ballot in November. So will every seat in the Republican-dominated Legislature — and the lawmakers elected this year are expected to be in power through the redistricting process that will follow the 2020 census. Alabama’s electoral calendar makes the question that has loomed for eight months — How well will Mr. Jones’s success transfer to other Democrats? — especially stark, particularly in a state that has tilted almost entirely toward Republicans in recent years. “There’s got to be a stemming of that tide, before you can say that his election was a high-water mark that stopped the Republicans from winning,” John H. Merrill, the Republican secretary of state, said in his Capitol office. "
1363,"At a time when the giraffe population is plummeting in the wild, the sale of products made with giraffe skin and bone is booming. According to a report to be released Thursday by Humane Society of the United States and its international affiliate, more than 40,000 giraffe parts were imported to the United States from 2006 to 2015 to be made into expensive pillows, boots, knife handles, bible covers and other trinkets. The sale of these products is legal, but the organization argues that restrictions are needed. Along with other advocacy groups, it has petitioned the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to provide that protection by listing giraffes as an endangered species. They are issuing the report now “to ramp up the pressure and show the public the true nature of the giraffe trade in the U.S., and show the administration that the public loves giraffes and really wants their government to take action to protect this animal,” said Adam Peyman, manager of wildlife programs and operations for the Humane Society International. In 2016, a study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources determined that the worldwide giraffe population had plummeted from 150,000 to 100,000 since 1985. Giraffes face two main threats, the report found: habitat loss and poaching by locals in search of bushmeat. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Trophy hunting seems to be the primary source of the animals arriving in the United States, but isn’t driving the animals to extinction, Mr. Peyman said. But any market for giraffe products puts more pressure on the species. Listing under the Endangered Species Act means that imports, exports and interstate commerce require a permit from the Fish and Wildlife Service, which must determine whether the action enhances the survival of the species. "
1364,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • That’s what a seemingly subdued President Trump was left wondering on Wednesday as White House advisers admitted they had no strategy to confront the legal setbacks involving two of his former aides. Mr. Trump praised Paul Manafort, his former campaign manager, as a “brave man” who “refused to ‘break’ ” or “make up stories in order to get a ‘deal.’ ” But the president distanced himself from Michael Cohen, his longtime personal lawyer, whom he cheekily suggested people not hire. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, repeatedly said that “the president has done nothing wrong” and that “there is no collusion.” But the mood at the White House was somber as aides wrestled with how to proceed. • The  news might not be good politically for Mr. Trump, but are the offenses impeachable? We looked to the founding fathers for answers. "
1365,"What will happen if the blue wave in the midterm elections falls short? Clearly, at this point it still might: Democrats will surely receive more votes than Republicans, but thanks to gerrymandering and population geography, the U.S. electoral system gives excess weight to rural, white voters who still have faith in President Trump. What if, thanks to that excess weight, the minority prevails? One answer, obviously, is that the unindicted co-conspirator in chief will continue to be protected from the law. And for those concerned with the survival of American democracy, that has to be the most important issue at stake in November. But if the G.O.P. hangs on, there will also be other, bread-and-butter consequences for ordinary Americans. First of all, there is every reason to believe that a Republican Congress, freed from the immediate threat of elections, would do what it narrowly failed to do last year, and repeal the Affordable Care Act. This would cause tens of millions of Americans to lose health insurance and would in particular hit those with pre-existing conditions. There’s a reason health care, not Trump, is the central theme of Democratic campaigns this year. But the attack on the social safety net probably wouldn’t stop with a rollback of Obama-era expansion: Longstanding programs, very much including Social Security and Medicare, would also be on the chopping block. Who says so? Republicans themselves. In a recent interview with CNBC’s John Harwood, Representative Steve Stivers, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee — in effect, the man charged with containing the blue wave — declared that, given the size of the budget deficit, the federal government needs to save money by cutting spending on social programs. When pressed about whether that included Social Security and Medicare, he admitted that it did. And he’s not alone in seeing major cuts in core programs for older Americans as the next step if Republicans win in November. Many major figures in the G.O.P., including the departing speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, and multiple senators, have said the same thing. (Meanwhile, groups tied to Ryan have been running attack ads accusing Democrats of planning to cut Medicare funding — but hey, consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. So, apparently, is honesty.) "
1366,"WASHINGTON — A restart of trade talks between the United States and China ended on Thursday with little sign of progress as Washington moved ahead with additional tariffs and President Trump met with legislators to discuss a new law aimed at curbing Chinese investment. The bilateral talks, while low level, were the first formal discussions between the two countries since the United States imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods and China retaliated with its own levies on American products. Still, administration officials continually played down the potential for resolution out of these talks, which came during a week in which the United States placed tariffs on another $16 billion worth of imports and trade officials began six days of hearings on proposed tariffs affecting an additional $200 billion in Chinese goods. A person familiar with the talks described them as a detailed discussion of China’s policies and the difficulties facing the Chinese economy. This person described the tone of the conversations as “frank” and said the team from the United States spoke with one voice. However, there were no signs of an imminent breakthrough, and no further talks have been scheduled at this time. In a statement on Thursday night, the White House reiterated the general areas of concern about the trade relationship that the Trump administration has been focused on for months. “We concluded two days of discussions with counterparts from China and exchanged views on how to achieve fairness, balance, and reciprocity in the economic relationship, including by addressing structural issues in China such as those identified in the Section 301 report,” said Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman. “We appreciated the Chinese delegation coming to the United States to participate in these meetings.” American negotiators focused more on asking China to make structural changes to its managed economy rather than simply purchasing American products, as had happened in some negotiating rounds in the past, another person briefed on the meeting said. But the United States and China remained far apart on a range of issues, with China complaining about United States violations of World Trade Organization rules, and the United States dismissing those concerns as irrelevant to bigger economic challenges between the countries, the person added.

1368,"How many people from Donald Trump’s campaign and inner circle have to confess to crimes or be convicted of them before it is clear to everyone — Republicans especially — that the campaign was guided by criminals, if not was a criminal enterprise itself? Tuesday’s conviction of former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and guilty plea by the president’s former lawyer Michael Cohen provided the utmost amplification of this reality. But it was Cohen’s implication of Trump in a felonious conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws that kicks the national crisis through which we are suffering up another level. This accusation cries out for a congressional inquiry, and not the sham, partisan, joke investigation that the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee conducted into Russian meddling. We need to know if the president broke the law and did so for his own benefit to influence the election. But that would require some sense of courage and patriotism among Republicans in Congress, and those qualities have been severely lacking. They sat quiet for so long — refusing to stand up to this president — that they allowed his narrative to subsume their party. He unleashed among Republicans the ugliness that mainstream Republicans always knew was there — indeed, they exploited it — but always thought they were smart enough and strong enough to control. Now, Republicanism is Trumpism, with no daylight between them. Traditional Republicans are now afraid to stand on principle because they do so at great peril of being drummed out of politics. The voters are now Trump’s noxious base, ergo Trump holds each of their fates in his hands. "
1369,"WASHINGTON — Amid a series of high-profile pardons and commutations by President Trump in recent months, his personal lawyers cautioned against even considering clemency for former aides under investigation by the special counsel until the inquiry was over, one of the lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said on Thursday. Mr. Trump agreed with their advice, Mr. Giuliani said. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is investigating possible pardon offers to former aides, and Mr. Trump’s current lawyers were privately concerned that debating clemency could open him to accusations of trying to interfere with the investigation, according to two people briefed on the matter. Mr. Giuliani said that he discussed the issue with Mr. Trump in June shortly after he commuted the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, 63, who was serving a life sentence in prison for a nonviolent drug conviction. Her campaign for commutation drew the backing of the reality television star Kim Kardashian West, who met with the president to advocate on Ms. Johnson’s behalf. “I went to see him and I said, ‘I have all these questions in the press about pardons. What I’d like to say is, “Nobody is going to get pardoned during the investigation,”’” Mr. Giuliani said, adding that he reassured the president that his power to pardon was not in jeopardy. Mr. Trump agreed with his assessment, Mr. Giuliani added. “As far as I know, he hasn’t changed his mind,” he said, adding that granting pardons to former aides convicted in the Russia investigation would be politically imprudent. Mr. Giuliani had said in an interview on Wednesday that he and Mr. Trump had discussed the political fallout should the president grant a pardon to Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman who was convicted of financial fraud this week, adding that one was not under consideration. Mr. Giuliani told The Washington Post earlier on Thursday that the president had asked his lawyers for their advice on pardoning Mr. Manafort, though Mr. Giuliani characterized the discussions to The New York Times as instigated by the lawyers, not the president. "
1370,"Two major European airlines said Thursday that they would suspend service to Tehran next month, a double-punch that underscored the power of reimposed American sanctions on Iran and the limited abilities of others to sidestep them. The suspensions, by British Airways and Air France, mean at least three large European carriers, which once held out great promise for their Iran business under the now-threatened nuclear agreement, will quit flying to and from the country in September. KLM, the Dutch sister airline of Air France, announced a similar suspension last month. The moves seemed bound to deepen Iran’s sense of economic isolation, which has worsened considerably in the nearly four months since President Trump scrapped American participation in the nuclear agreement negotiated by the administration of his predecessor, Barack Obama. Mr. Trump and his aides have warned foreign businesses to steer clear of Iran to avoid reimposed American sanctions, which take full effect in November. “Drastically reducing direct flights to Europe certainly has a psychological and economic impact,” said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group, an aviation and defense industry consultancy in Fairfax, Va. Both British Airways and Air France attributed their decisions to a drop in demand that had made the Iran routes unprofitable, and they did not mention the effects of Mr. Trump’s actions. But industry analysts said the primary cause was clear. "

His frequent punching bag over the Russia investigation, Jeff Sessions, pushed back firmly. “While I am attorney general, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.” Mr. Trump expressed support for his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was convicted on bank and tax fraud charges on Tuesday. And he derided his former fixer, Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations the same day, for “flipping,” saying it “almost ought to be illegal” to do so. He also found time to tweet a false claim that South Africa’s white farmers were being killed on a “large scale.” _____ 2. And in intriguing news: David Pecker, a tabloid executive close to President Trump, has been granted immunity by prosecutors, our reporters learned. "
1372,"The 95-year-old Nazi who was deported this week after living quietly in Queens for decades was not the only member of his squad to come to New York City. Jakiw Palij, a former member of Hitler’s Schutzstaffel, or SS, arrived in Germany on Tuesday, 14 years after the federal government stripped him of citizenship. But the story of how Mr. Palij arrived in the United States, acquired citizenship and built a life in Queens is not one of a lone Nazi thwarting immigration laws, but of a trio of Third Reich soldiers working together to find haven in America, one vouching for the other two on visa applications. Mr. Palij worked at a death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland where the SS executed an estimated 6,000 Jews in a single day — Nov. 3, 1943 — making it the “largest killing operation against Jews in the entire war,” according to Christopher Browning’s book “Ordinary Men.” On June 27, 1949, Mr. Palij walked into the American consular office in Schweinfurt, Germany, and applied for a visa under the Displaced Persons Act, which was meant for people left homeless by the war, said Peter Black, the former chief historian for a Department of Justice unit devoted to deporting former Nazis. Mr. Palij claimed that he had worked as a laborer on his father’s farm in Piadyki, which was then part of Poland, and as a factory worker in Germany during the war. "
1373,"Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s longtime lawyer, made hush money payments before the 2016 election to two women who claimed to have had affairs with Mr. Trump: Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, and Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels. Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws and other charges on Tuesday. Mr. Trump’s suggestion that Mr. Cohen acted on his own is contradicted by court filings and by Mr. Cohen himself. The events are described in court documents that do not name the two women. However, both Ms. McDougal and Ms. Clifford publicly discussed their stories; additionally, Mr. Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny J. Davis, has verified their identities in news media interviews. Here’s the timeline: In court, Mr. Cohen said he made those payments at Mr. Trump’s direction. “I and the C.E.O. of a media company at the request of the candidate worked together to keep an individual with information that would be harmful to the candidate and to the campaign from publicly disclosing this information,” he said on Tuesday, referring to the payment to Ms. McDougal. Referring to the payment to Ms. Clifford, Mr. Cohen continued: “In coordination with, and at the direction of the same candidate, I arranged to make a payment to the second individual with information that would be harmful to the candidate and to the campaign to keep the individual from disclosing the information.” Mr. Cohen said in court that Mr. Trump coordinated and directed him to make the payments. Mr. Trump and his lawyers and representatives have given a number of conflicting statements on whether and when Mr. Trump was aware of the payments. "
1374,"“Don’t get #vaccines. Illuminati are behind it.” “Do you still treat your kids with leaves? No? And why don’t you #vaccinate them? It’s medicine!” With messages like those, Russian internet trolls meddling in the 2016 presidential election also lashed out at Americans debating the safety of vaccines, a new study has found. But instead of picking a side, researchers said, the trolls and bots they programmed hurled insults at both pro- and anti-vaccine advocates. Their only intent, the study concluded, seemed to be to raise the level of hostility. “You see this pattern,” said David A. Broniatowski, a computer engineer at George Washington University and lead author of the study, which was published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health. “On guns, or race, these accounts take opposite sides in lots of debates. They’re about sowing discord.” [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] With colleagues at the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Broniatowski looked at 899 vaccine-related tweets sent from mid-2014 to late 2017. Some came from accounts known to send out spam or link to malware; more came from accounts that congressional investigators and NBC News have identified as belonging to Russian trolls. "
1375,"WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department moved on Thursday to block states from circumventing new federal limits on state and local tax deductions. A proposed Treasury Department rule, certain to face legal challenges from several states, would limit the type of charitable contributions that Americans are allowed to deduct on their federal taxes. The rule would effectively exclude donations that are rewarded with state tax credits. The regulation would affect only taxpayers who currently deduct more than $10,000 in state and local taxes. And its effect would most likely be concentrated among high earners in high-tax states, some of which created credits to help residents reduce the federal take. But it could also adversely affect taxpayers in other states, where such credits were already being given for contributions made to certain private or charter schools and universities, land donated for conservation purposes and donations to housing assistance programs. The proposed rule involves a provision of the new Republican tax law that set a $10,000-a-year cap on deductions for state and local taxes. The cap helped Republicans keep the estimated cost of the tax law, which centers on a sharp reduction in the corporate tax rate, under $1.5 trillion, to comply with a budget procedure that allowed the bill to pass without the support of any Democrats. Angered by the move, New York and New Jersey passed laws that set up charitable funds for state services, such as schools, and awarded state tax credits based on donations to those funds. Taxpayers making the donations would reduce their state taxes by the amount of the credit, but the state’s revenue would not fall. The idea was to create a roundabout way of funding state services that preserves a higher federal tax deduction for residents — because the charitable deduction is not subject to the same cap as the state and local tax deduction.

1376,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A showdown in Canberra, profits and protections in China and images of an uncontacted tribe in the Amazon. Here’s what you need to know: • China’s difficult game. Trade talks in Washington were not expected to yield much. American tariffs on another $16 billion worth of Chinese imports have gone into effect, and President Trump is helping shape a new law that will beef up blocks to foreign investment. As the trade war intensifies, China’s economy is slowing. So Beijing is pushing banks to lend more, allowing indebted local governments to spend money on big projects again, and shoring up the value of the country’s currency. But Alibaba hasn’t missed a beat: China’s e-commerce leviathan reported a rise in sales of more than 60 percent in the latest quarter compared with a year earlier — even as many Chinese consumers are cutting back. And trade wars aside, there’s a futuristic tilt to a chunk of the Chinese economy that redefines the role of the human. An art critic and The Times’s former Shanghai bureau chief discuss exactly that as they share thoughts on “Asia One,” a video installation by the Guangzhou-born artist Cao Fei, on view in New York. _____ "

f there was a moment that summed up the feral nature of Australian politics, it must have been when the House of Representatives voted to adjourn Thursday so that the challenge to Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership could work its way out. I was in Parliament House, and the debate made me think of the look our pup gave me when I caught her chewing my favorite books from college. She seemed ashamed, but would she really change? Democracy these days doesn’t have much more self-control than that little mutt. Australia is part of a larger trend. In country after country, leaders elected to act on our behalf are encouraging or being threatened by venal instincts and dark urges. Of course, the dysfunction on display in Canberra (here’s our story on that) is not new. In fact, many sociologists and political scientists will tell you, the unraveling here and elsewhere has been generations in the making. For decades, the ranks of people who run for office in Australia, the United States and in many other “mature” democracies have narrowed. Parties have become less representative of the people. Technology has moved faster and with more menace than our public institutions, and at the same time media has become more agenda-driven, more divisive — and more threatened by disruption. "
1378,"President Trump needs a new defense. He started out with the claim that he didn’t know anything about payments that his former lawyer Michael Cohen arranged or made to the former Playboy model Karen McDougal and the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels. Mr. Cohen’s tape destroyed that assertion, at least as it applied to Ms. McDougal. His defense then evolved to denying any personal responsibility for those actions. Predictably, Mr. Cohen’s plea agreement on Tuesday destroyed that defense, too, after he told a federal judge under oath that the president had directed him to arrange payments to the two women, who claim to have had affairs with Mr. Trump, “for the principal purpose of influencing the election.” Now President Trump has moved on to a new defense, claiming that what he did wasn’t a crime and so it can’t be prosecuted. That argument has no basis, either, and is inconsistent with centuries of Anglo-American law. Here’s the new Trump argument, stripped down to its essence: It was clear that he would reimburse Mr. Cohen for those payments to the women, and he’s allowed under Supreme Court precedent to give his campaign as much of his own money as he wants to. The problem is that legally, his argument doesn’t get him where he wants to go. Even though Mr. Trump can give his campaign as much of his own money as he wants to, he can’t ask other people to front the money for him and promise to pay them back later without reporting the arrangement in a timely fashion to the Federal Election Commission. But he didn’t report it, subverting the whole point of the nation’s post-Watergate campaign finance laws, which is to disclose campaign giving and spending to the American people before an election — not 20 months later.

1380,"WASHINGTON — The Green Beret team leader who was singled out in a Pentagon investigation for blame after a deadly ambush in Niger last October has now been recommended for one of the military’s highest valor awards, officials said. In an internal Special Operations Command report submitted last week, Army commanders recommended that the soldier, Capt. Michael Perozeni, receive a Silver Star — a rare honor that recognizes singular acts of valor and heroism in combat. The recognition is at odds with the public conclusions of an Africa Command report released in May that said that Captain Perozeni was one of the central figures in a mission gone wrong, while not directly attributing any blame to senior leadership. Military officials have said that both narratives — that Captain Perozeni filed a misleading mission plan before the operation but then showed gallantry during the ambush — are true. Together, they are part of the fierce debate about a Pentagon shadow war in which four American soldiers died while on a murky mission in West Africa. Army leaders must now make a difficult decision about which of those two story lines will prevail. Captain Perozeni is one of five soldiers from Operational Detachment-Alpha Team 3212 who are being considered for a Silver Star. Three others have been recommended for the Distinguished Service Cross, the Army’s second-highest award, according to two Defense Department officials who are familiar with the report and described it to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity. [Get a weekly roundup of Times’ coverage of war delivered to your inbox. Sign up here] The award recommendations were delivered to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis last Friday in the annex of an internal investigation into the ambush by the military command that oversees Special Operations forces. They sharply contrast with findings by the Africa Command that seized on missteps by junior officers before an unprepared and poorly equipped 11-man team and 30 Nigerien soldiers headed into western Niger’s desert scrub in search of a local militant leader, Doundoun Cheffou. But critics said the findings glossed over blame for senior commanders who had ordered the mission. "
1381,"To the Editor: Re “Cost of E.P.A.’s Pollution Rules: Up to 1,400 More Deaths a Year” (front page, Aug. 22): Coal is well on its way to dying a natural death as a fuel, as cleaner and cheaper alternatives (natural gas, solar, wind) become increasingly available. The mining of coal is one of the most deadly and dangerous occupations in the world. There is no energy shortage in the United States, and to allow and encourage more use of coal-fired power plants at the expense of human lives is both cynical and cruel. The number of miners found to have debilitating lung disease caused by inhaling coal dust has risen notably in the last few years. High levels of particulate matter in the air lead to impaired lung growth in children, chronic lung disease in adults and myriad other health effects, including premature death. Everything about the loosening of regulations related to the use of coal is wrong, and it represents a violation of the public’s trust in the government’s obligation to safeguard the lives of its citizens. There is no clearer example of putting profits over people than deliberately poisoning the atmosphere in pursuit of dollars. Neil W. Schluger

The writer is chief of the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. To the Editor: It is well established that coal plants tend to be located near low-income communities of color. Most of the excess mortality will be borne by those closest to the plants, so it’s hardly surprising that the Trump administration doesn’t appear particularly concerned with excess deaths among this demographic. Does anyone really doubt that if these coal plants happened to be located next to, say, Mar-a-Lago, that the proposed change in rules would look a lot different? Timothy Ciccone

1382,"Good morning on this dazzling Thursday. Let’s, for a minute, imagine a beach in Manhattan. Manhattan is the only borough without one. Other big cities, like Copenhagen and Paris, have built centrally located swimming areas, so why can’t we? Mayor Bill de Blasio thinks it’s “an interesting idea,” or at least he said so when asked about it on NY1 this month. “As a New Yorker, I’m kind of intrigued,” he said. The mayor was responding to a New York Times editorial that suggested the idea. We recently asked New York Today readers to share their thoughts — the pros and cons — and tell us where they would put it. The responses were mostly in favor, with a few detractors. A selection of those responses: The yes camp: Near Christopher Street: “As someone who has lived in Copenhagen before, I spent most of my second summer here in New York City showing my friends social media posts from family and friends jumping into the Copenhagen harbor and questioning the water here. What if you could swim laps off Christopher Street? (With guarantees you wouldn’t grow a mutated third arm.) Sounds pretty perfect to me.” — Jake Petersen, 27, Williamsburg, Brooklyn Battery Park: “A beach would cap the decades long effort to open up the city’s waterfront, and go beyond the traditional esplanades and walkways that have been employed in recent years to ring Manhattan. Battery Park would be a good place to create a pilot beach, but tidal studies would have to first be conducted to ensure safe swimming is possible before moving forward.” — Richard Murdocco, 31, Syosset, N.Y. Anywhere clean: “Yes of course a beach is always a lovely and attractive idea. Who doesn’t want to sit on the sand? I do think the practical issues of water currents and the cleanliness of the water is key. Also would there be public bathing, changing and toilets provided? These often a mess but could be maintained. Or would the beach serve as a place to sit and enjoy drinks with friends? This might be the best option. Enjoying the beach experience, without the swimming issues.” — Michelle Jaffé, 62, TriBeCa, Manhattan Along the Hudson River: “I think a Manhattan Beach is a great idea! If you’ve ever been to Chicago, there is nothing like walking up Michigan Avenue and running into a big, beautiful beach integrated right into the heart of the city. Ideally, the beach should be located where it would be most accessible — by walkers, joggers, residents, and tourists, and it should be close to a jogging or running trail.” — Charles Biener, 60, Larchmont, N.Y.

1384,"WASHINGTON — How much economic damage will global warming cause? That’s one of the key questions embedded in the Trump administration’s recent proposals to weaken Obama-era regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from both vehicles and power plants. When federal agencies calculate the costs and benefits of climate regulations, they use a figure called the “social cost of carbon,” an estimate of the harm caused by releasing more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and increasing global warming. In its rollback proposals, the Trump administration argued that each ton of carbon dioxide emitted by a car or a coal plant in 2020 would only cause around $1 to $7 in economic damages. That’s far lower than the Obama administration’s central estimate, which, after adjusting for inflation, argued that same ton of carbon dioxide would cause roughly $50 in total damages. That change will make a big difference for the cost-benefit analyses that agencies are required to conduct for new rules. If the Trump administration can successfully claim that carbon dioxide causes relatively little harm to the economy, then it can more easily justify moves like replacing the Clean Power Plan, an ambitious Obama-era program to cut pollution from coal plants, with a less-stringent rule. So how did the Trump administration conclude that global warming will be much less costly than the Obama administration assumed? First, the Environmental Protection Agency focused solely on damages from climate change that would occur within the borders of the United States rather than across the entire globe. Second, they used calculations that put less weight on the harm climate change could inflict on future generations. "
1385,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Thursday that he was appointing a special envoy to handle negotiations with North Korea. Just days earlier, he introduced special envoys for Iran and Syria, equally knotty problems. Another for Afghanistan is said to be in the offing. In its early days, the Trump administration slashed the number of special envoys, seeing them as an unnecessary bureaucratic layer. R.C. Hammond, a top official, routinely bemoaned that there were more than 60 such envoys, making the department’s organizational chart look like a starburst. But Mr. Pompeo is a man in a hurry. Frustrated with a nomination process that has been slowed by White House missteps, a lengthy blacklist against onetime Trump critics and increasing partisanship on Capitol Hill, he is moving to bring in highly experienced diplomats to coordinate policy on the most difficult issues he faces. No administration in modern American history has had its top diplomats confirmed at a slower rate. Forty-three embassies have no ambassador, and some of the world’s most strategically important countries — Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Pakistan and Australia — still have no nominees. The department’s bureaus for East Asian and Pacific affairs and for South and Central Asian affairs, vital centers for coordinating and implementing policy, do not have nominees for their top slots. And only one of the department’s six under secretary positions has a Senate-confirmed appointee. On his first trip overseas as secretary of state, Mr. Pompeo said his top goals were to energize a discouraged staff and fill dozens of diplomatic posts left empty by his predecessor, Rex W. Tillerson. "
1386,"Dozens of American business leaders are challenging the Trump administration over changes to immigration policy that they say threaten the livelihoods of thousands of their skilled foreign workers, and the nation’s economic growth and competitiveness as well. The executives, members of the Business Roundtable, expressed their “serious concern” over the administration’s immigration moves in a jointly signed letter delivered late Wednesday to Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security. Some of the most prominent chief executives in the United States signed the letter, including Timothy D. Cook of Apple, Ginni Rometty of IBM, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Laurence Fink of BlackRock, Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Indra Nooyi, the departing head of PepsiCo. The letter comes during a week when the broader debate over the country’s immigration policies has been reignited by the arrest of a Mexican laborer in the killing of an Iowa woman. It also underscores the continuing tension between America’s globally minded corporate establishment and the Trump administration’s “America First” agenda. Business leaders have praised President Trump’s tax cuts and rolling back of many regulations. But they have deplored some of his statements and some of his administration’s actions, including on immigration. In one of the most notable examples of the strain, several White House business advisory councils dissolved last year after Mr. Trump blamed “many sides” for white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va. "
1387,"WASHINGTON — When Congress created its academic support fund three years ago, lawmakers had in mind a pot of money that would increase student access to art and music, mental health and technology programs at the nation’s most impoverished schools. But back-to-back school shootings this year and inquiries from the state of Texas have prompted the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, to examine whether to allow states to tap the school enrichment fund for another purpose: guns. Such a move would reverse a longstanding position taken by the federal government that it should not pay to outfit schools with weaponry. It would also undermine efforts by Congress to restrict the use of federal funding on guns. As recently as March, Congress passed a school safety bill that allocated $50 million a year to local school districts, but expressly prohibited the use of the money for firearms. But the Every Student Succeeds Act, signed into law in 2015, is silent on weapons purchases, and that omission would allow Ms. DeVos to use her discretion to approve or deny any state or district plans to use the enrichment grants under the measure for firearms and firearm training, unless Congress clarifies the law or bans such funding through legislative action. “The department is constantly considering and evaluating policy issues, particularly issues related to school safety,” said Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department. The $1 billion student support program, known as the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants, is intended for the country’s poorest schools and calls for school districts to use the money toward three goals: providing a well-rounded education, improving school conditions for learning and improving the use of technology for digital literacy.

1388,"Reality Winner, the former Air Force linguist and intelligence contractor who pleaded guilty in June to leaking a top-secret government report on Russian hacking, was sentenced on Thursday to five years and three months in federal prison. Ms. Winner, 26, is the first person to be sentenced under the Espionage Act since President Trump took office. Prosecutors said her sentence was the longest ever imposed in federal court for an unauthorized release of government information to the media. She was arrested in June 2017 and was held for more than a year while prosecutors built a case. She pleaded guilty in June 2018 to one felony count of unauthorized transmission of national defense information, for giving a classified report about Russian interference in the 2016 election to a news outlet. Prosecutors said on Thursday that Ms. Winner’s actions merited a stiff sentence. “Winner’s purposeful violation put our nation’s security at risk,” United States Attorney Bobby L. Christine told reporters after the sentencing in federal court in Augusta, Ga. He said the report she leaked revealed sources and methods of intelligence gathering, and its disclosure “caused exceptionally grave damage to U.S. national security.” He added that she “knowingly and intentionally betrayed the trust of her colleagues and her country,” and was “the quintessential example of an insider threat.” Ms. Winner was fresh out of the Air Force and a few months into a job as a translator for the National Security Agency in May 2017 when prosecutors say she printed a report from her work computer that detailed hacking attacks by a Russian intelligence service against local election officials and voter registration databases. She later told investigators that she smuggled the report out of the Augusta, Ga., offices of the contractor, Pluribus International, in her pantyhose, and then mailed it to the online news outlet The Intercept.

1389,"Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, would have been convicted on all 18 charges of financial fraud but for one holdout juror, who forced a mistrial on 10 counts, another member of the jury said on Wednesday. That juror, Paula Duncan, who described herself as a strong supporter of President Trump, said on Fox News that even though she believed the prosecutors had targeted Mr. Manafort in hopes of gaining information against Mr. Trump, the evidence against him “was overwhelming.” “I did not want Paul Manafort to be guilty,” Ms. Duncan said, “but he was.” Mr. Manafort, 69, was convicted Tuesday of five charges of tax fraud, two charges of bank fraud and one count of failure to disclose a foreign bank account. Ms. Duncan said 10 members of the jury were solidly convinced of his guilt on the other 10 counts as well. An 11th juror wavered at points but was ultimately won over after the other jurors pointed out what Ms. Duncan called an extensive paper trail. “But the one holdout would not,” she said in an interview on “Fox News at Night with Shannon Bream.” “We laid it out in front of her again and again and she still said she had a reasonable doubt.” She described the four days of deliberations as heated, adding: “Crazily enough, there were even tears.” "

Ms. Benanti, a favorite of audiences and critics, will step into the role on Oct. 23, succeeding Lauren Ambrose, who is leaving to shoot a television show. Ms. Ambrose’s final performance will be Oct. 21. The current Broadway revival of “My Fair Lady,” directed by Bartlett Sher, has been running since March at Lincoln Center Theater, where it opened to outstanding reviews. It has also proved to be popular, grossing more than $1 million a week. Ms. Ambrose, best known for her work on the television show “Six Feet Under,” received a Tony nomination for “My Fair Lady.” She is departing to shoot a series being produced for Apple by M. Night Shyamalan. Ms. Benanti is a five-time Tony nominee who won in 2008, for “Gypsy.” Recently she has achieved wider recognition for her impersonation of Melania Trump on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” Ms. Benanti, like Ms. Ambrose, will play the role seven times a week, opposite Harry Hadden-Paton as Higgins, through Feb. 17. On Tuesday nights, Kerstin Anderson will play Eliza. "
1391,"WASHINGTON — The suspected hacking attempt of the Democratic National Committee’s voter database this week was a false alarm, and the unusual activity that raised concern was merely a test, party officials said on Thursday. The blunder was caused by a lack of communication between the national committee and one of its state branches, the officials said. The Michigan Democratic Party had hired hackers to simulate an attack known as phishing, but did not inform the national committee. The Michigan Democratic Party’s test had attributes similar to an actual hacking, said Bob Lord, the national committee’s chief security officer. When the Democratic National Committee was contacted by cybersecurity experts this week about the activity, it notified the F.B.I. out of fears that it was another Russian attempt to penetrate the committee, as Moscow did during the 2016 presidential campaign. The jolts of panic caused by what turned out to be an intraparty action underscored the fear of another major breach of the party’s systems just weeks before the midterm elections, even as computer security has been made a priority and shored up since 2016. American intelligence officials have said there continue to be real threats from Russia to interfere in American elections. “There are constant attempts to hack the D.N.C. and our Democratic infrastructure, and while we are extremely relieved that this wasn’t an attempted intrusion by a foreign adversary, this incident is further proof that we need to continue to be vigilant in light of potential attacks,” Mr. Lord said in a statement. Brandon Dillon, chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, called the situation a “misstep” and said it was part of efforts to improve cybersecurity “especially as the Trump administration refuses to crack down on foreign interference in our elections.” "
1392,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Up against the ferocity of fire, it is easy to feel that forces beyond our control are at work. In the middle of the worst wildfire season in memory in California, there is a great sense of powerlessness in the face of nature. Yet, almost every fire, as we detailed this week, is ignited by a person — either by mistake or on purpose. A flat tire on a trailer drags against the asphalt, sending a spark into dry vegetation and setting a racing inferno that kills people and destroys homes. That is how the Carr Fire began. A person with a hammer is believed to have mistakenly set the fires of the Mendocino Complex blaze, now the largest in California history. Scientists agree that extreme weather patterns brought on by climate change have made fire seasons more destructive, partly by drying out more vegetation that serves as the fuel for wildfires. Experts also worry that not enough attention is given to all the ways people have made the problem of wildfires worse. Population growth in California means there are more people on the roads — cars are a prime culprit in wildfires — and more homes built in wilderness areas. “It would be easy to throw our hands in the air and say it’s just climate change, and we can’t do anything about it,” said Jennifer K. Balch, a professor of geography at the University of Colorado at Boulder and an expert on wildfires. “But actually we are starting the majority of wildfires, and we can do something about it.” "
1393,"My inbox was full on Wednesday. Michael Cohen. Paul Manafort. Collusion! Corruption! Grifter! Crook! These were the words that kept popping up in emails from people who see Cohen’s plea deal as a vindication of their deeply held opinions of the president. Trump supporters who emailed me had a different set of themes: Mueller, Clinton, Obama, double standards, conspiracy — all the way up to ruling-class privilege. The president’s detractors claim that Cohen’s plea agreement proves that President Trump violated campaign finance regulations. It does no such thing. For example, the payment to Stormy Daniels was, according to Rudy Giuliani, reimbursed — and was therefore a personal expenditure. There is a strong legal case that even in the context of a political campaign, paying hush money, while tawdry, is not illegal. More to the point, since when did campaign finance violations become this country’s idea of an impeachable offense? There is simply no precedent for imposing the political equivalent of the death penalty in such cases. The Obama campaign paid $375,000 in fines for its violations of election law. A similar case was unsuccessfully brought against the former Senator John Edwards for payments he made to keep an adulterous affair secret while he was running for president. Given all this, and Justice Department guidelines against indicting a sitting president, we are left with a situation in which Democrats seeking adjudication of their allegations would have to pursue impeachment in the House and, if they were successful there, a subsequent trial in the Senate. But any such action is fraught with political peril. Turning the midterms into a referendum on impeachment could easily backfire. Campaign finance laws exist to ensure that the ability to influence elections is contained within prescribed boundaries. In other words, any violation of those laws represents illegal influence on an election. But if campaign finance violations now become impeachable offenses, what does the future hold? For one thing, elections wouldn’t be able to settle anything. If a new precedent is set lowering the bar for removing a president from office, we will see more attempts to invoke that precedent and nullify elections. This would simply repeat what is happening now: an attempt to change a political conflict into a legal one.

1394,"WASHINGTON — President Trump blamed the Justice Department on Thursday for the investigations surrounding him, criticized the deal struck with his former lawyer Michael D. Cohen and lashed out at Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who countered with a rare public rebuke of the president. Mr. Trump also praised Paul Manafort, his former campaign manager who was convicted of financial fraud this week, for refusing to cooperate with the Justice Department and said that plea agreements, an essential tool for prosecutors, should maybe be outlawed. “It’s called flipping, and it almost ought to be illegal,” Mr. Trump said in an interview that aired on Fox News. Asked whether he was considering firing Mr. Sessions, the president only reiterated his longstanding objection to Mr. Sessions’s recusal from the Russia investigation and his insistence that he would have chosen another person for attorney general had he known someone else would oversee the inquiry. “He took the job and then he said, ‘I’m going to recuse myself,’” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Sessions. “I said, ‘What kind of a man is this?’” In an implicit but pointed reply, Mr. Sessions warned the president not to intrude on federal law enforcement. “While I am attorney general, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations,” he said in a statement issued shortly before he met with Mr. Trump at the White House about criminal justice overhaul. “Jeff, this is GREAT, what everyone wants, so look into all of the corruption on the ‘other side,’” Mr. Trump wrote in a pair of Twitter posts early Friday morning. “Come on Jeff, you can do it, the country is waiting!” "
1395,"Good Thursday. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Saudi Aramco’s public market debut, which would have been the biggest ever, is being postponed. Instead, the Middle Eastern oil giant is focused on buying a stake in Sabic, a huge publicly traded chemical maker controlled by the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund. Why pause? Arranging such a huge I.P.O. is complex, and oil prices have rebounded, which made the offering less attractive. But the decision hurts several groups: • The Saudi government misses out on a multibillion-dollar windfall that it said would finance a transformation of its economy. • Bankers won’t be getting millions in advisory fees. • Stock exchanges lose the prospect of a monster listing. • Start-ups might find the Saudi investment fund stops being so generous. Aramco officials insisted that the I.P.O. would still happen someday. They wouldn’t say when, though. A Sabic deal could put billions in the Saudi sovereign fund’s coffers. But it probably won’t be enough to pay for that $500 billion robot-run city. "
1396,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa — President Trump waded into South Africa’s proposal to seize land from white farmers, saying in a post on Twitter late Wednesday that he had asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to “closely study” the “the large scale killing of farmers” — a claim disputed by official figures and the country’s biggest farmer’s group. Mr. Trump’s comment came after the Fox News host Tucker Carlson presented a late-night program on South Africa, including land seizures and homicides, and described President Cyril Ramaphosa as “a racist.” The tweet gives prominence to a false narrative pushed by some right-wing groups in South Africa that there have been numerous seizures of white-owned land and widespread killings of white farmers. Some of those groups have brought their claims to the United States on lobbying trips. On Thursday, the South African minister of international relations, Lindiwe Sisulu, described the tweet as “regrettable” and “based on false information.” The government said it would seek clarification from the United States Embassy, and Ms. Sisulu planned to “communicate with Secretary of State Michael Pompeo on the matter through diplomatic channels.” The government has said expropriating farms is necessary to deal with longstanding inequities and that only unused land would be subject to seizure, suggesting that land that is being actively farmed would be safe. "
1397,"Federal prosecutors reached an immunity deal with the tabloid executive David J. Pecker, a key witness in their monthslong investigation into payments during the 2016 campaign to two women who said they had affairs with Donald J. Trump, according to two people familiar with the investigation. Mr. Pecker is the chairman of American Media Inc., the nation’s biggest tabloid news publisher, which was involved in the payments, which prosecutors have identified as illegal contributions made in violation of campaign finance law. As prosecutors in New York built a case against Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s longtime lawyer, that resulted in a guilty plea on Tuesday, Mr. Pecker emerged as an important figure. The investigation appears to be continuing, and as a longtime friend and ally of Mr. Trump, Mr. Pecker could have additional information valuable to the prosecutors. In pleading guilty to campaign finance violations, Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump directed him to arrange the hush money payments to protect Mr. Trump from embarrassing stories during the campaign. The cooperation of Mr. Pecker is another potential blow to the president from a former loyalist. It was unclear on Thursday whether prosecutors had granted Mr. Pecker immunity for his involvement in the illegal campaign contributions, or simply agreed not to prosecute him based on the information he provided. One of the people briefed on the matter cautioned that Mr. Pecker could still face scrutiny. The agreement was disclosed on Thursday by The Hive, a Vanity Fair site. Court documents included detailed descriptions of Mr. Cohen’s interactions with A.M.I. as the hush money payments to the women — a pornographic film star and a former Playboy model — were arranged. "
1398,"SAN FRANCISCO — The post went up quietly on Facebook’s internal message board last week. Titled “We Have a Problem With Political Diversity,” it quickly took off inside the social network. “We are a political monoculture that’s intolerant of different views,” Brian Amerige, a senior Facebook engineer, wrote in the post, which was obtained by The New York Times. “We claim to welcome all perspectives, but are quick to attack — often in mobs — anyone who presents a view that appears to be in opposition to left-leaning ideology.” Since the post went up, more than 100 Facebook employees have joined Mr. Amerige to form an online group called FB’ers for Political Diversity, according to two people who viewed the group’s page and who were not authorized to speak publicly. The aim of the initiative, according to Mr. Amerige’s memo, is to create a space for ideological diversity within the company. The new group has upset other Facebook employees, who said its online posts were offensive to minorities. One engineer, who declined to be identified for fear of retaliation, said several people had lodged complaints with their managers about FB’ers for Political Diversity and were told that it had not broken any company rules. Another employee said the group appeared to be constructive and inclusive of different political viewpoints. Mr. Amerige did not respond to requests for comment. The activity is a rare sign of organized dissent within Facebook over the company’s largely liberal workplace culture. While the new group is just a sliver of Facebook’s work force of more than 25,000, the company’s workers have in the past appeared less inclined than their peers at other tech companies to challenge leadership, and most have been loyalists to its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. "
1399,"The top American air commander in the Middle East voiced frustration in an interview last week over the murderously incompetent Saudi-led air campaign in Yemen. Though welcome, his sentiment was far too mild. It should have been more like horror — and shame over American complicity in what a new United Nations report views as criminal carnage. Saudi Arabia and its Sunni allies intervened in Yemen more than three years ago to rout Iran-backed Shiite rebels who had driven the internationally recognized government out of the capital and into Saudi exile. As the conflict has dragged on, the rebels have also been accused of atrocities, but the United Nations body and human rights groups say it is the Saudi-led air war that has done the most to turn an already impoverished country into a humanitarian nightmare and an indiscriminate killing field. Again and again, Saudi-led airstrikes have struck civilian targets, slaughtering innumerable innocents. Last Friday, the United Nations said the coalition killed at least 22 children and four women as they fled a battle zone. Two weeks earlier, on Aug. 9, a coalition air assault struck a school bus, killing dozens of children. Countless more civilians have been killed by bombs at markets, weddings, funerals — more than 6,500 by the official count, but certainly many, many more. Millions more civilians are suffering from shortages of food and medical care. That’s the horror. The shame: The bomb that annihilated the school bus and its young passengers was American. According to CNN, it was a 500-pound, laser-guided bomb sold to Saudi Arabia in an approved arms deal — similar to the bomb that devastated a funeral hall in October 2016, in which 155 people were killed. After that, then-President Barack Obama banned the sale of precision-guided military technology to Saudi Arabia. The ban was overturned by the Trump administration in March 2017. A report published last week by Human Rights Watch focused on the “woefully inadequate” investigations conducted by the coalition’s own mechanism; they often amount to cover-ups of what are likely war crimes. “Many of the apparent laws-of-war violations committed by coalition forces show evidence of war crimes — serious violations committed by individuals with criminal intent,” Human Rights Watch stated. Yet far from holding anyone accountable, King Salman of Saudi Arabia in July issued a sweeping pardon of all military personnel involved in the Yemen operation. "
1400,"WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis opened the door on Tuesday to restarting large-scale military exercises on the Korean Peninsula, appearing to contradict President Trump, who had labeled the war games costly and “provocative” two months ago in trying to lower tensions with North Korea. Mr. Mattis insisted that the step did not signal that the era of détente between the Trump administration and Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, was over. But the Pentagon chief’s comments came amid souring relations: In the last week alone, the United States canceled a trip by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Pyongyang and North Korean state media accused the United States of “double-dealing attitudes” and “extremely provocative and dangerous military moves.” “We took the step to suspend several of the largest exercises as a good-faith measure coming out of the Singapore summit,” Mr. Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon on Tuesday, referring to Mr. Trump’s decision to shelve large-scale drills with South Korea after meeting with Mr. Kim in June. “We have no plans at this time to suspend any more exercises,” Mr. Mattis said. Any resumption of large military exercises involving the Americans and South Koreans is certain to infuriate North Korean officials, who regularly denounce such operations. And the reversal reflects confusion within the Trump administration about how to deal with North Korea. The president’s declaration of victory after his landmark summit meeting in Singapore in June has given way to tense accusations and counteraccusations. Mr. Trump has not yet returned to the verbal hostilities that he engaged in on his Twitter feed during his first year in office, when he referred to Mr. Kim as  “Rocket Man” and raised the specter of bombing North Korea. "
1401,"LOS ANGELES — California took some of the most aggressive steps yet to counter the effects of climate change as legislators voted Tuesday to require that 100 percent of the state’s electricity come from carbon-free sources. The bill gives the state until 2045 to meet the goal. California had already imposed a mandate to generate 50 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030; the bill increased the amount to 60 percent. The move highlights California’s determination to be a leader on climate issues. In May, state regulators revised the building code to require newly built homes to be equipped for solar power. The state’s aggressiveness comes as the Trump administration is moving to loosen or abandon environmental regulations and promoting a revival of the coal industry. And it follows a year in which catastrophic wildfires that many attribute to climate change have been responsible for dozens of deaths in the state, destroyed homes and businesses and cost billions of dollars. “This is a pivotal moment for California, for the country and the world,” said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club. California joins Hawaii, which passed legislation in 2015 calling for 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2045. Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Washington, D.C., are also considering such a mandate, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Maryland and Colorado had considered bills but have not passed the requirement. "
1402,"A burglar broke into a Manhattan penthouse early Tuesday and made off with a briefcase and an iPad belonging to a banker who once did work for President Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, the police said. The homeowner, David Fallarino, 38, is a loan officer at Citizens Bank who handled loan paperwork for Mr. Manafort, who was convicted last week on federal financial fraud charges related to his overseas lobbying work. Mr. Fallarino, who was not implicated in wrongdoing, called the police around 3 a.m. on Tuesday after discovering the break-in at his apartment on West 58th Street near Central Park, the police said. He told investigators that he was awakened two hours earlier by the sound of his front door slamming, the police said. Mr. Fallarino told investigators he found a crowbar on his private terrace and discovered that the briefcase, the iPad and a pair of sneakers were missing from the living room, the police said. There were no signs of forced entry; Mr. Fallarino said he had left the terrace door open, the police said. The stolen items were worth about $2,050, the police said. A wine cabinet on the terrace was found open, the police said, and an unopened bottle was on the ground. There were no arrests on Tuesday, and the police were poring over security camera video from the building and from others nearby to identify a suspect. The nine-story building is a prewar co-op located one block south of Central Park; it has a 24-hour doorman, according to real estate listings. Mr. Fallarino did not respond to an email or phone call seeking comment. During Mr. Manafort’s trial in United States District Court in Alexandria, Va., federal prosecutors introduced correspondence with Mr. Fallarino as evidence to help prove Mr. Manafort committed bank fraud. Mr. Manafort was found guilty on eight of 18 counts, including charges that he lied to Citizens Bank between December 2015 and March 2016 to obtain a $3.4 million loan for a condominium in Manhattan’s trendy SoHo neighborhood. The jury was deadlocked on two other counts that accused Mr. Manafort of engaging in a conspiracy to commit bank fraud to obtain the loans from Citizens Bank. Mr. Fallarino appeared to be the point person who handled Mr. Manafort’s loan applications, but he was never called to testify, as were some other employees of Citizens Bank. One of Mr. Manafort’s accountants, Cindy LaPorta, testified at trial that she had knowingly misrepresented his income and real estate holdings to Mr. Fallarino to help her client borrow from Citizens Bank. For instance, she said she submitted a document to Mr. Fallarino falsely claiming that $1.5 million in income from a company that Mr. Manafort controlled was a loan from a third party that had been forgiven. That misrepresentation was part of a convoluted effort to make Mr. Manafort seem more creditworthy. "
1403,"ORLANDO, Fla. — Florida Democrats nominated Andrew Gillum, the Tallahassee mayor, and Republicans tapped Representative Ron DeSantis for governor Tuesday, setting the stage for a ferocious general election in the country’s largest swing state between one of President Trump’s most unabashed allies and an outspoken progressive who would be Florida’s first black governor. Mr. Gillum’s narrow defeat of the former congresswoman Gwen Graham, the front-runner, represented one of the most significant upsets of the primary season and a major victory for the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. It sets up twin governors’ races in neighboring Southern states between left-leaning African-Americans banking on the region’s new, diversifying electorate, and ardent, Trump-style nationalists. Georgia’s Democratic candidate, Stacey Abrams, will now be joined by Mr. Gillum, while its Republican candidate, the secretary of state Brian Kemp, has a mirror to the south in Mr. DeSantis. And here, with redistricting looming after the next census, Medicaid expansion on the line and control of the most crucial presidential battleground at stake, the Florida governor’s race is shaping up to be a titanic showdown. The specter of two young, hard-charging politicians who represent the beating heart of their parties facing off will supercharge the fall campaign. “We’re going to make clear to the rest of the world that the dark days that we’ve been under, coming out of Washington, that the derision and the division that has been coming out of our White House, that right here in the state of Florida we are going to remind this nation of what is truly the American way,” Mr. Gillum told jubilant supporters in Tallahassee. "
1404,"I’m about to graduate from college. I’m gliding across campus with a bhangra bounce to my step. All I have to do is walk across the podium and grab the diploma. At the last second, I realize I’ve failed to submit my senior thesis and can’t graduate. I become overwhelmed, panic, and attempt an epic cram session. But I know it’s pointless. I’ve run out of time. Then I wake up. I’m a 37-year-old man with a family who actually graduated from college and law school and is suffering from a midlife crisis that reveals itself in recurring nightmares. One night, I’m panicking over a final exam. Another night, I’m in fifth grade, overweight and wearing husky pants while my classmates wear trendy jeans. They’re all remixes of the same plot: I’m stuck, falling more behind all the time. The anxiety that I haven’t done enough — and will never do enough — is heightened by living in a political climate that makes it feels more urgent than ever to make a difference in the world. To do something that matters. When I met the high school student Cameron Kasky, a Parkland shooting survivor, he told me about his activism against gun violence. I felt inspired, but also worthless — realizing I’d spent the night trying to hide the salsa stain on my dress shirt. My childhood crush Alyssa Milano is using her Twitter account to raise awareness about social justice issues like a woman’s right to choose, while I still find myself slipping into talking about what I had for lunch. I remind myself that I’m lucky to have the opportunity to write for large audiences, but in some ways this intensifies the pressure I put on myself. On many of the days I haven’t published a new piece, I’m hit with the realization that my friends from college are canvassing their neighborhoods to get out the vote for the 2018 midterms, while I’m deciding whether to take my kids to the mall or Chuck E. Cheese’s. I used to think a midlife crisis was a problem manufactured by privileged suburbanites. But my personal angst combined with my anxiety about the state of the country have made mine feel very real. For the first time in our marriage, my wife, a calm and optimistic physician, asked me how we are going to protect our Muslim kids in America. She asked this on the day the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Trump’s travel ban. Her question hit like a sledgehammer to the chest. Babies have been separated from their parents at the border and remain in detention. Record heat waves are sweeping the country. Income inequality is widening all the time. I’m not just stuck — I’m wasting my time navel gazing about a midlife crisis when there’s suffering all around me. Recently at a journalism conference, I told the writer Jonathan Rauch that I thought I was suffering from a midlife crisis. “Wait until you’re 50. It gets a lot better,” he told me, recommending his book “The Happiness Curve: Why Life Gets Better After 50.” “What? I have to wait until 50? Hell no!” was my response. Mr. Rauch’s book affirms the normality and prevalence of the crisis, unpacking the overwhelming research revealing the U-curve, which charts people’s happiness in nearly 60 countries. Happiness declines during our 30s, hitting the nadir at 46, but then steadily rises and peaks at 70. "
1405,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The main reason that Mollie Tibbetts’s horrible killing has received so much attention is racism. Tibbetts’s accused murderer is a Mexican immigrant, and large segments of the conservative media, including talk radio and Fox News, like to call attention to crimes committed by people with dark skin. It’s silly to pretend otherwise. You’ll notice the pattern if you spend any time watching or listening to these media sources. The pattern becomes especially clear when they descend into falsehoods. Just look at the made-up story that Fox promoted last week about land seizures in South Africa, which led to a false tweet from President Trump about “the large-scale killing of farmers.” Or look at Lou Dobbs’s long history of telling on-air lies about immigrants (despite their comparatively low crime rates). Dobbs, other right-wing hosts and Trump have no such history of making up stories about crimes committed by white people. I don’t think it’s possible to have an honest conversation about the Tibbetts debate without acknowledging the role that race plays. But I also think that David A. French’s piece in National Review is worth reading, especially for progressives. French starts the piece by acknowledging the role of racism. That’s not his focus, though. His goal, instead, is to persuade readers that race is not the sole reason that the Tibbetts case resonates with so many people. "
1406,"President Trump, in a series of early morning Twitter posts on Tuesday, attacked Google for what he claimed was an effort to intentionally suppress conservative news outlets supportive of his administration. Mr. Trump’s remarks — and an additional warning later in the day that Google, Facebook and Twitter “have to be careful” — escalated a conservative campaign against the internet industry that has become more pointed since Apple, Google and Facebook removed content from Alex Jones, a right-wing conspiracy theorist who runs the site InfoWars and has been a vocal supporter of Mr. Trump. “Google search results for ‘Trump News’ shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake New Media,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter at 5:24 a.m. “In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent.” Mr. Trump added that “they are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!” Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council and a longtime advocate of deregulation, appeared to back Mr. Trump when asked by reporters later on Tuesday whether the administration would be pursuing more regulation of Google. “We’ll let you know,” Mr. Kudlow said. “We’re taking a look at it.” In a statement, Google said that its search service was “not used to set a political agenda and we don’t bias our results toward any political ideology.” "
1407,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) There are two independent bookshops off the charming town square in Healdsburg, Calif., and local hardware stores have thrived as the community has pushed back against the encroachment of big box retailers. The community also loves its local newspaper. When Rollie Atkinson, who owns four weekly newspapers in Sonoma County, reduced the number of print pages a couple of years ago, loyal readers “raised holy hell,” he said. But it was a fiscal necessity: The traditional business model for newspapers, in Healdsburg and elsewhere, was failing rapidly. So as he cast about for new ideas to save the business, he was inspired by what another Northern California news outlet, the digital news site Berkeleyside, had done: raise about $1 million by selling stock to readers. So this year, Mr. Atkinson, in what is believed to be a first for a local newspaper, began making his pitch at cocktail gatherings and dinner parties and in full-page advertisements. The so-called direct public offering — essentially a small scale I.P.O. but without investment banks — has so far raised $100,000 by selling equity. The offering lasts until next March, and Mr. Atkinson said he hoped to raise $400,000. That money, first and foremost, will go toward higher wages for his journalists, some of whom have been making about $15 an hour. Mr. Atkinson’s company, Sonoma West, includes four newspapers — The Healdsburg Tribune, The Cloverdale Reveille, The Windsor Times and Sonoma West Times & News — whose combined paid circulation is about 9,900. Some readers who invested said they did so not just to support their local paper, but also as statement against the rise of fake news, and against a president who has constantly battled the notion of a free press.

1409,"The first and only debate between Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and his Democratic rival, Cynthia Nixon, is set for Wednesday, and the candidates have been bunkered in prep sessions with their advisers. But even before the high-stakes clash begins, a predebate battle is being waged — over the temperature dial. Ms. Nixon’s team has publicly accused the debate host, WCBS-TV, of catering to all of the governor’s demands to land the debate, and they are concerned that the debate hall at Hofstra University on Long Island might feel like an ice rink when they arrive. (Mr. Cuomo is famous for preferring to make his public appearances in deeply chilled conditions.) So in a pre-emptive strike, Rebecca Katz, a top strategist for Ms. Nixon, asked WCBS-TV in an email last week that the debate hall be warmed to 76 degrees. Ms. Katz wrote that working conditions are “notoriously sexist when it comes to room temperature, so we just want to make sure we’re all on the same page here,” according to a copy of her email obtained by The New York Times. Ms. Katz said on Tuesday she had yet to hear back from WCBS-TV, and that 76 degrees was just an opening offer to ensure the temperatures were not uncomfortably cold. The Cuomo campaign said it was unaware of what temperature the room would be. The station declined to comment. "
1410,"LONDON — Iran’s Parliament summoned President Hassan Rouhani to answer questions on Tuesday about the country’s economic crisis, and then voted to reject his explanation, in a remarkable rebuke of a sitting leader. Mr. Rouhani blamed United States sanctions, not government management, for his country’s troubles. But after he answered five questions about economic challenges like high unemployment and the collapsing value of the national currency, the rial, a majority of lawmakers voted that they were “not convinced” by four of his answers. Elected by wide margins in 2013 and 2017, Mr. Rouhani is seen as a moderate in Iranian politics, and he campaigned on easing hostilities between his country and the West, and increasing economic opportunity. In 2015, his government struck a deal with the United States and other powers to give up elements of its nuclear program in return for the lifting of some sanctions. But this year, President Trump withdrew the United States from that agreement and reimposed sanctions not only on Iran but also on companies doing business with the country. That has persuaded many European businesses to stay away from the Islamic republic, though their countries’ governments still support the deal. Iran experts say that unwinding the agreement could strengthen the hand of hard-liners who oppose both the deal and Mr. Rouhani’s reformist agenda. His government runs many of the country’s daily affairs, but the ultimate power rests with the supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the unelected Guardian Council. The lawmakers’ vote came two days after Parliament dismissed the finance minister. In the last few weeks, the country’s central banker and its labor minister have also been fired. "
1411,"GENEVA — The military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in Yemen has killed thousands of civilians in airstrikes, tortured detainees, raped civilians and used child soldiers as young as 8 — actions that may amount to war crimes, United Nations investigators said in a report issued Tuesday. The report singled out Saudi and Emirati airstrikes for causing the most civilian casualties, saying they had hit residential areas, markets, funerals, weddings, jails, boats and medical facilities. “There is little evidence of any attempt by parties to the conflict to minimize civilian casualties,” said Kamel Jendoubi, the chairman of the panel of experts that produced the report. The report also said the Houthi rebels, who control northern Yemen and are fighting the Saudi-Emirati coalition, may have committed war crimes. They were accused of shelling civilians, torturing detainees, recruiting young children to fight and blocking access to humanitarian agencies. “None have clean hands,” one of the experts, Charles Garraway, a retired military officer who served for 30 years as a legal officer in the British Army, told reporters in Geneva. “Despite the severity of the situation, we continue to witness a total disregard of the suffering of the people of Yemen.” A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition said it would respond after its legal team had reviewed the report. "
1412,"KHARTOUM, Sudan — South Sudanese rebels refused on Tuesday to sign the latest draft of a peace deal that would have ended a devastating civil war, a new setback in the five-year conflict. President Salva Kiir and the leader of the main rebel group, Riek Machar, signed a cease-fire and power-sharing agreement earlier this month, having reached a preliminary deal in June that intended to end the fighting that first broke out in 2013. But Mr. Machar and another rebel group refused on Tuesday to sign the latest draft of the agreement, saying that disputes over power sharing and a new constitution had not been sufficiently addressed. “This is an unfortunate development that will not reflect well on the impartiality of the mediators and will throw doubt onto the whole process,” the rebels said in a statement. Sudan has brokered talks between Mr. Kiir and various rebel groups this year, and its foreign minister, Al-Dirdiri Mohamed, continued to hold out hope that the new obstacles could be overcome. “We hope that the sides which did not make the final signature today will sign in due course,” he said, but added, “It’s not possible to achieve peace without the participation of Machar.” "
1413,"MOSCOW — He was long reviled by Russia’s state-controlled media as a deranged warmonger. President Vladimir V. Putin said he had “lost his roof” — in other words, gone crazy — during his time in captivity in Vietnam. Despite, or rather because of, all the abuse, however, Senator John McCain will be sorely missed in Moscow. The Arizona senator’s death last Saturday from a brain tumor has deprived the Kremlin and its propaganda machine of not only a cherished punching bag but the central protagonist in their favorite conspiracy theory — the view that Western sanctions against Russia and President Trump’s inability to lift them have nothing to do with anything Russia has done but are the result of “Russophobia.” In a report on Mr. McCain’s death, Rossiya 1, a state television channel, called him “the chief symbol of Russophobia” and as such the main reason Moscow’s relations with the West are so bad. Life News, an outlet close to the Russian security services, declared him the West’s “chief Russophobe.” The beauty of “Russophobia” from Russia’s perspective is that it absolves Moscow of any responsibility for the consequences of its own actions — the annexation of Crimea, its military incursions into Georgia and eastern Ukraine, the shooting down of a Malaysian passenger jet and its repeated meddling in Western elections — and has turned the country into an innocent victim of, well, John McCain. But what to do now that, as Oleg Morozov, a member of the foreign affairs committee of Russia’s upper house of Parliament, declared this week, “The enemy is dead”? Alexander Domrin, a Moscow academic and administrator of a Facebook page called “Russians for Donald Trump,” said he was “not sorry” that Mr. McCain had died, “because he was an enemy of my country,” but conceded that finding a replacement hate figure will not be easy.

Ms. Freeland said she was “encouraged by the progress that the U.S. and Mexico have made, particularly on cars and labor.” The last-ditch discussions came a day after the Trump administration announced that it and Mexico had made changes to Nafta and threatened to leave Canada out, which could leave its economy reeling.

1415,"WASHINGTON — A day after President Trump threatened to exclude Canada from a revised North American Free Trade Agreement, top Canadian officials raced to Washington and said they were moving “full steam ahead” to try to reach a compromise that could save the trilateral pact. “This is a really big deal,” Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s foreign minister, said on Tuesday after meeting with the United States trade representative. “We are encouraged by the progress that the U.S. and Mexico have made, particularly on cars and labor,” she said, adding that those concessions were “going to be valuable for workers in Canada and the United States.” The last-ditch discussions come as Canada faces an ultimatum from the Trump administration, which has promised to ink a trade deal with Mexico in days and leave Canada from the pact. Ms. Freeland, who cut short a trip to Europe to fly to Washington, must now decide by Friday whether to join a revised pact that has been a source of contentious negotiations for a year or allow her country to be cast out of an agreement that has been critical to its economy. “We will, as we have done throughout this negotiation, stand up for the Canadian national interest and for Canadian values while looking for areas where we can find a compromise,” she said, before heading to meet with Mexican officials. Canada may have little choice but to sign onto the pact. In the nearly quarter century since Nafta went into effect, various industries like automakers and food suppliers have built coordinated supply chains across the continent. If those links are splintered by new trade agreements, “we’re clearly left off worse than we were before,” said Christopher Wilson, the deputy director of the Wilson Center’s Mexico Institute. The effects would be especially severe for the global auto industry, which has built its supply chain around North America and relies on materials and components from Canada. Auto industry groups warned that a Nafta without Canada would drive up prices for American manufacturers and make them less competitive with foreign companies. "
1416,"It used to be a good thing. “Voluntary submission to equality with inferiors” was how Samuel Johnson defined “condescension” in his 1755 dictionary. When a person of higher status treated a person of lower status as though they were peers, it was an act of generosity — one that both pleased the beneficiary and gratified the self-regard of the benefactor. Nowadays, we’re inclined to see it as odious, and we’re inclined to see it a lot. “Democrats are a party of condescension, not hope,” a MarketWatch headline warns. Josh Barro, in Business Insider, says, “They have become smug and condescending toward anyone who does not match the personal lifestyle choices of liberal elites.” A Reuters report tells us that in some parts of the country, “the word ‘Democrat’ is often a euphemism for out-of-touch, condescending coastal elites.” The results of the last presidential election might be read as confirmation of this caricature: Trump swept the least-educated counties, Clinton the most-educated. The debate continues over whether the condescension of liberal elites helped spark populist resentment. What’s clear is that “condescension,” which once named an endearing gesture of courtesy, has turned toxic. How did we get here from there? Let’s retrace our steps. In Fanny Burney’s epistolary novel “Evelina,” from 1778, we’re told that a well-born character “thinks it incumbent upon her to support the dignity of her ancestry. Fortunately for the world in general, she has taken it into her head, that condescension is the most distinguishing virtue of high life; so that the same pride of family which renders others imperious, is with her the motive of affability.” Condescension made her kind. By the time Jane Austen was writing, though, the word was already starting to rouse suspicion: When Mr. Collins, in “Pride and Prejudice” (1813), extols the “affability and condescension” of Lady Catherine, readers were reminded that this clergyman was at once snobbish and obsequious. Discomfort with the word outpaced discomfort with the practice. The intellectual historian Don Herzog tells of the time, in the early 1830s, when the Duke of Devonshire took his librarian, John Payne Collier, lunch at the duke’s palatial estate. “He always does his utmost to lessen the distance between us, and to put me at my ease, on a level with himself,” Mr. Collier wrote in his diary. “I do not call it condescension (he will not permit the word), but kindness.” Neither of them really believed they were equals, though; the duke’s denial that he was condescending was itself a form of higher-level condescension. Nothing marks the rupture between that age and our own so clearly as the discarded notion that condescension is virtuous. In our more democratic age, we don’t dare admit that we think we are better than others, let alone that anyone is better than us. Yet hierarchy hasn’t gone anywhere, and something like 18th-century condescension remains a common practice. We’ve simply lost the name for it. When the president of a university stops to speak to a student after a lecture, she is talking down a hierarchy of academic status. The student is likely to be charmed — just as an Episcopal priest is gratified by the “considerate” attentions of a bishop and the security guard is pleased when the “down to earth” museum trustee remembers her name. We’re happy when the higher-status person acts as if she’s on our level — which is why, as that Duke of Devonshire understood, you condescend best by pretending not to. "
1417,"For decades, Americans living in certain neighborhoods couldn’t borrow money to buy houses and build businesses. These neighborhoods were home to people of color, immigrants and poor white people. Banks, real-estate agents, local officials and the federal government labeled their neighborhoods “hazardous,” marking them off with red lines on maps. The Community Reinvestment Act was passed in 1977 to end this practice of “redlining,” by requiring banks to lend money in the communities where they are chartered to do business or receive deposits. Banks have made nearly $2 trillion in small-business and community development loans since 1996, according to our calculations, to meet the requirements of the law. That’s an impressive record. But the law didn’t erase discrimination. Nor has it ended America’s glaring economic segregation, which is caused in part by unequal access to banking and credit. Three out of four neighborhoods marked “hazardous” by government surveyors 80 years ago are still lower-income today, according to our analysis. Nevertheless, the Trump administration is proposing changes promoted as ways to simplify the law that will, in fact, be a huge step backward. On Tuesday, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced it will review and revise the rules it sets for banks to comply with the Community Reinvestment Act. One of the proposed changes is the introduction of a mathematical formula, a ratio, that banks and regulators could use to measure a bank’s performance under the law. "

1419,"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. The story idea came straight from Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The New York Times: a profile of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City who’s now a lawyer for the president. The central question Mr. Baquet was interested in was how he went from being a “national healer” in a post-9/11 New York City to the president’s “No. 1 public defender,” as Clifford Levy, The Times’s Metro editor, put it. The article, on Tuesday’s front page, ended up drawing on the collective expertise of the Metro desk, which covers New York, and the Washington bureau. The editors of both teams covered Mr. Giuliani when he was mayor, some two decades ago, as did the reporters on this week’s article. “I don’t know how many other outlets have that vast repository of institutional knowledge of those two men,” said Dan Barry, a senior writer on the story who served as City Hall bureau chief when Mr. Giuliani was mayor. “It’s just interesting that two guys who were creatures of 1980s Manhattan and 1990s Manhattan; two guys whose paths would cross at cocktail parties and fund-raisers; two guys who go way back in the media scrum that is New York City — are now in the White House,” Mr. Barry said. “And they’re not representing the craziness of New York City. They’re representing the United States of America.” "
1420,"WASHINGTON — As President Trump demanded a makeover of the North American Free Trade Agreement over the past year, Canada staked out a position squarely at odds with the White House: Any new pact must recognize climate change. That demand is now facing a test. The United States and Mexico, the other two parties to the three-nation trade deal, in recent days have hammered out a possible revision of the pact, and Mr. Trump is urging Canada to sign on or be hit with automobile tariffs. The revised terms don’t mention climate change, according to the scant details made public Monday, and the Trump administration has long dismissed the science that shows global warming poses a serious threat to people and economies. Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s foreign affairs minister, was in Washington on Tuesday to continue negotiations. Her government so far has given little indication of its intentions beyond a statement by Ms. Freeland’s spokesman, Adam Austen, who said the priority was that any deal be “good for the middle class.” Canada’s calls for a trade deal to address climate change are the latest example of the ways that global warming can break on to the world stage and trigger political setbacks, even in nations already struggling to meet their targets for reducing pollution under the Paris climate agreement. In France, the environment minister quit during a live radio interview on Tuesday, saying the nation wasn’t doing enough on green issues. And last week in Australia, the prime minister was unseated by a challenger with strong coal-industry connections. Canada, much like Australia, has a powerful energy industry, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces a challenge from politicians aligned with the oil industry there. The new premier of Ontario, Doug Ford, also has vowed to fight Mr. Trudeau’s plan to put a price on carbon emission in Canada when it takes effect next year. "
1421,"WASHINGTON — A former C.I.A. officer running for Congress accused a super PAC aligned with Speaker Paul D. Ryan on Tuesday of improperly obtaining her entire federal security clearance application — a highly sensitive document containing extensive personal information — and then using it for political purposes. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic candidate challenging Representative Dave Brat of Virginia, sent a cease-and-desist letter to Corry Bliss, the executive director of the Congressional Leadership Fund, which has raised more than $100 million to help Republicans in the midterm elections. She demanded that the super PAC destroy all copies of the form and agree to not use the information in any fashion. “I write as a former civil servant and as an American, in shock and anger, that you have tried to exploit my service to our country by exposing my most personal information in the name of politics,” she wrote. The super PAC released a statement on Tuesday strongly denying Ms. Spanberger’s charge, saying that the document was obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request filed with the United States Postal Service by America Rising, a separate Republican-aligned research firm. “C.L.F. follows the letter of the law in examining any candidate’s background and Ms. Spanberger was no different,” Courtney Alexander, a spokeswoman for the group, said in the statement. The group also released a portion of the security clearance application, blacking out some personal information. "
1422,"TORONTO — First the American president started a trade war with Canada, one of the United States’ closest allies and trading partners, imposing tariffs on the country’s steel and aluminum. Then, he called Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “very dishonest and weak,” shattering what was expected to be his moment of glory on the world stage at the Group of 7 conference in Quebec. Now, President Trump has gone behind Canada’s back and negotiated what he calls a trade deal with Mexico, leaving Canada on the sidelines. He has also threatened to impose hefty tariffs on cars, one of Canada’s most important exports. The power play has sent the country reeling, with trade lawyers trying to gauge how much of Mr. Trump’s threat was negotiation bluster versus directive, and economists sorting through what a world without the North American Free Trade Agreement would mean for Canada. Most conclude that an end to Nafta in itself would not severely harm the country’s economy, although it could chill international investment — but that Mr. Trump’s threatened 25 percent auto tariff would be disastrous. “This would be enough to throw us into a recession because the auto industry is so important to Canada,” said Philip Cross, the former chief economic analyst at Statistics Canada, a government agency. “We are in uncharted territory here.” It’s the biggest rift yet in the relations between the two nations, and one that could have the biggest practical import. In recognition of the stakes, Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s foreign affairs minister, cut short a visit to Europe and rushed to Washington to shoulder her way back into the bargaining room, although her spokesman said that the government’s position had not changed, and that it would only sign a deal that was good for Canada. "
1423,"Sept. 3 (AP) — President Trump stopped his motorcade in Manhattan today, jumped out of his limousine and shot a man on Fifth Avenue who was shouting anti-Trump epithets. The shooting was recorded by the White House press pool as well as by dozens of bystanders with cellphones and by security cameras in the area. When asked for his reaction, House Speaker Paul Ryan said, “We will need more information than is available at this point.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said through pursed lips that he “was not going to comment on every up and down with this president.” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes said he already had information indicating that the man whom Trump shot “worked for the Clinton Foundation and may have been a relative of former Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin.” Fox News did not cover Trump’s shooting at the top of its broadcast, which focused instead on the killing of an Iowa woman by an undocumented immigrant. Fox’s only reference to the fact that the president shot a man on Fifth Avenue was that “a New York City man died today when he ran right into a bullet fired by the president.” Senator Lindsey Graham quipped that “Trump shoots as well as he putts” and that this incident would not cause the South Carolina senator to cancel his coming golf round with the president at his Bedminster, N.J., course. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that she was looking the other way when the shooting happened so she had no comment, adding: “I haven’t had a chance to discuss it with the president. I’ll get back to you if I have something. But the president has stated many times that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get away with it. So he’s just keeping a campaign promise. He did nothing wrong. There are no charges against him. And even though I have no comment, and he has no comment, we’ve commented on this extensively.” Hours later, though, the president tweeted: “Actually, some people are saying that a man who looked a lot like Barack Obama did the shooting. I’m not saying that — but some people are. It also could have been somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds who fired that shot. Like Rudy said: Truth is not truth — unless I say so.” "

1425,"WASHINGTON — President Trump warned evangelical leaders Monday night that Democrats “will overturn everything that we’ve done and they’ll do it quickly and violently” if Republicans lose control of Congress in the midterm elections. Speaking to the group in the State Dining Room of the White House, Mr. Trump painted a stark picture of what losing the majority would mean for the administration’s conservative agenda, according to an audiotape of his remarks provided to The New York Times by someone who attended the event. “They will end everything immediately,” Mr. Trump said. “When you look at antifa,” he added, a term that describes militant leftist groups, “and you look at some of these groups, these are violent people.” A White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley, declined to elaborate on what the president meant. The blunt warning — delivered to about 100 of the president’s most ardent supporters in the evangelical community — was the latest example of Mr. Trump’s attempts to use the specter of violence at the hands of his political opponents and to fan the flames of cultural divisions in the country. In the wake of racial violence last year in Charlottesville, Va., Mr. Trump said there was “blame on both sides” and equated liberal, anti-fascist protesters with Nazis and white supremacists. In spring 2016, the president warned of violence by his own supporters if he did not get the Republican presidential nomination, saying “I think you’d have riots.” Mr. Trump acknowledged to the evangelical leadership that his conservative base may not turn out at the polls in big numbers for Republican congressional candidates because he is not on the ballot in November. "
1426,"In our polarized political times, voting across party lines — be it for an issue or a person — has become increasingly rare. After Senator John S. McCain, Republican of Arizona, died Saturday, dozens of readers, including many who identified as Democrats, wrote in our comments section that his efforts at bipartisanship occasionally inspired them to ignore party lines, too. [[Read Senator John McCain’s farewell statement.]] Several of his constituents from Arizona, as well as other Americans who voted for him during his 2000 and 2008 presidential runs, reflected on his legacy. Even Republicans who didn’t always appreciate Mr. McCain’s reputation for crossing party lines expressed admiration for him as a politician. Here is a lightly edited and condensed selection of those comments. As a Democrat in Arizona, I voted for McCain as senator because I felt he was a leader for all, one who would reach across the aisle to try to create solutions for all Americans. It’s a sad loss for Arizona, America and our legislative branch. I’ll never forget shaking his hand as we both were leaving the building our respective offices shared, and watching him get into a car driven by his daughter. In that moment he was a father, not a politician. Rest in peace, Senator. You served your family and America well. — Susan, Phoenix I’m also a registered Democratic voter in Arizona. He’s the only Republican I’ve ever voted for, though not for president in ’08. — Buckaroo, Georgetown, Guyana "
1427,"PARIS — France’s high-profile environment minister was fed up with what he considered insufficient progress by his government on issues like climate change and clean energy. So on Tuesday, he quit his post in dramatic fashion, dealing a blow to President Emmanuel Macron’s green credentials. The minister, Nicolas Hulot, an environmental activist and former television star who regularly ranked as one of Mr. Macron’s most popular ministers, made the surprise announcement during a live interview on France Inter radio in which he said he no longer wanted to “lie to myself.” “I don’t want to create the illusion that my presence in the government means that we are up to the task on these issues, and so I have decided to leave the government today,” Mr. Hulot told the stunned radio hosts, one of whom asked him whether he was being serious. The abruptness of the decision came as a surprise: Mr. Hulot told France Inter that he had not warned Mr. Macron, the prime minister or even his own staff about the announcement. He said that he had considered quitting for several months after an “accumulation of disappointments,” but that the decision was precipitated on Monday night when he saw an uninvited lobbyist at a meeting with the president over a relaxation of hunting rules. He called that episode “symptomatic” of the influence of lobbyists in “circles of power.” It had been widely expected that Mr. Hulot would eventually step down, despite several victories, including the government’s decision to drop a controversial airport project in western France and to end sales of gas and diesel cars by 2040.

1428,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Relents, Offering Praise for Bitter Rival” (front page, Aug. 28): Pressure from the public and within his administration ultimately forced President Trump to re-lower the White House flag to half-mast and deliver a halfhearted and clearly insincere statement about Senator John McCain, who died on Saturday. Some truths are self-evident: Mr. Trump simply can’t stand the fact that Mr. McCain, regardless of party affiliation or philosophical and policy differences, earned, and will forever have, the respect and admiration of the American people and countless others throughout the world. In addition to his demonstrable indecency, cruelty and lack of civility, President Trump has jealously sunk into the depths of pettiness. Jay Adolf

1429,"A long-awaited analysis of Hurricane Maria’s deadly sweep through Puerto Rico prompted the government on Tuesday to sharply increase the official death toll. The government now estimates that 2,975 people died as a result of the disaster and its effects, which unfolded over months. The new assessment is many times greater than the previous official tally of 64, which was not revised for nearly a year despite convincing evidence that the official death certificates failed to take full account of the fatal and often long-range impacts from the storm across the island. The revision came just hours after the release of a new assessment of excess deaths in the roughly six months after the storm, conducted at the government’s request by researchers at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health. Their report found that nearly 3,000 more deaths than expected occurred in the wake of the storm — 22 percent more than the number of deaths that normally might have occurred in that period. At issue has been how to assess the severity of a storm whose devastating impact on fundamental needs — water, electricity, communications and medical care — seemed to rival or exceed that of the deadliest recent storms to hit the United States, but whose official fatality count until now was far less severe. By comparison, Hurricane Katrina, which struck the Gulf Coast in 2005, is thought to have killed anywhere from 1,000 to more than 1,800 people. The government’s latest revision brings to a close a year of debate and scientific scrutiny over fatality estimates that had seemed to vary widely — in some cases by thousands. Gov. Ricardo Rosselló faced constant political challenges over the disparity between the official death toll, released within weeks of the disaster, and what was apparent to most scientific researchers and reporters who investigated deaths. The inability to provide a reliable death count seemed, to many critics, to echo the dysfunction apparent in the island’s lack of preparation or any swift, effective response from the local and federal governments. Relief supplies were bottled up at the port, gas and food were in short supply, and electrical power was cut off to large sections of the island for months. Full power was restored to the last homes only this month. "
1430,"During closing arguments last week in a routine drug trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan, a defense lawyer questioned the credibility of one of the government’s cooperating witnesses, a drug dealer named Kenny Ashe. “Mr. Ashe’s testimony should be disregarded because it’s not true,” the defense lawyer said. Then he added, “You know what’s funny? Yesterday, Manafort was convicted.” The reference to Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, drew an immediate “objection” from the prosecutor. At a sidebar out of the jury’s earshot, the lawyer, Kafahni Nkrumah, explained that he wanted to tell the jury about President Trump’s criticism of cooperating witnesses — “flippers,” as Mr. Trump had called them. One such witness, Rick Gates, had testified at Mr. Manafort’s financial fraud trial in Alexandria, Va. “I believe that the president’s opinion of cooperators is just as pertinent as anyone else’s,” Mr. Nkrumah told the judge, adding, “He is talking about cooperators, the essence of this case.” Legal experts have debated whether Mr. Trump’s sharp commentary on the criminal justice system could erode jurors’ trust in the law. They cite his attacks on the Justice Department and on the F.B.I., his description of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, as “a witch hunt,” and his criticism of government efforts to turn witnesses into cooperators. “It’s called flipping,” Mr. Trump said in an interview on “Fox & Friends” last week, “and it almost ought to be illegal.” "
1431,"MIAMI — Andrew Gillum’s campaign bus was running late, tied up in rain and traffic on Interstate 95, so his relatives waiting to catch a glimpse of the final days of his surging candidacy had a few minutes to reminisce about the politician as a young boy. “He’s always been a kid that was different from all the rest,” George Jackson, his 71-year-old uncle, said of Mr. Gillum, the son of a bus driver and a construction laborer who grew up in the southern end of Miami-Dade County. “Always had a book up to his head. His grandmother always told him that he was special.” Grandma, it seems, was right. On Tuesday, Mr. Gillum, 39, became the first black nominee for Florida governor, achieving a stunning and improbable come-from-behind win over four wealthy Democratic challengers whose personal fortunes proved no match for Mr. Gillum’s compelling life story and progressive message. “We’re going to unite this state,” Mr. Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, told a crowd of supporters on Tuesday night. “What’s going to bring us together is our common and shared belief that regardless of where you come from, regardless of what your mother or your father did for their profession, regardless of what side of the tracks you live on that, that every single Floridian ought to have their equal and fair shot at the American dream.” [Read key takeaways from Tuesday night’s results.] Mr. Gillum’s upset victory mirrors neighboring Georgia, where Stacey Abrams defied expectations by easily securing the Democratic nomination in a bid to become the nation’s first black female governor. The November governor’s race in Florida will pit Mr. Gillum, who campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and with Bernie Sanders this month, against Representative Ron DeSantis, who dominated the Republican primary by embracing the policies and style of President Trump. "
1432,"Let us pause for a moment to mark the loss of a fierce and tireless public servant: Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz., who so robustly devoted himself to terrorizing immigrants that he was eventually convicted of contempt of court and would have lived out his twilight years with a well-deserved criminal record if President Trump, a staunch admirer of Mr. Arpaio’s bare-knuckle approach to law enforcement, had not granted him a pardon. To clarify, Mr. Arpaio the man has not passed. As of Tuesday, he was still very much alive and kicking, the proto-Trumpian embodiment of fearmongering ethnonationalism. Mr. Arpaio’s dream of returning to elective office, however, has been dealt what is most likely a fatal blow by his loss in Arizona’s Republican primary for the Senate. Cast aside and left to wallow in the knowledge that his moment has passed, he has a fitting end to the public life of a true American villain. This defeat came as a surprise to no one. In the closing weeks of the race, his campaign had begun melting down. His staff was in chaos, and polls showed him trailing both Representative Martha McSally, Tuesday’s victor, and Kelli Ward, an anti-immigration firebrand also courting the right wing of the party. As “America’s toughest sheriff,” as Mr. Arpaio liked to call himself, prepares to ride off into the sunset, it bears recalling that he was so much more than a run-of-the-mill immigrant basher. His 24-year reign of terror was medieval in its brutality. In addition to conducting racial profiling on a mass scale and terrorizing immigrant neighborhoods with gratuitous raids and traffic stops and detentions, he oversaw a jail where mistreatment of inmates was the stuff of legend. Abuses ranged from the humiliating to the lethal. He brought back chain gangs. He forced prisoners to wear pink underwear. He set up an outdoor “tent city,” which he once referred to as a “concentration camp,” to hold the overflow of prisoners. Inmates were beaten, fed rancid food, denied medical care (this included pregnant women) and, in at least one case, left battered on the floor to die. [Receive the day’s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.] Indeed, many prisoners died in Mr. Arpaio’s jail — at an alarming clip. The number of inmates who hanged themselves in his facilities was far higher than in jails elsewhere in the country. More disturbing still, nearly half of all inmate deaths on his watch were never explained. Over the years, the county paid out tens of millions in wrongful death and injury settlements. "
1433,"I cannot think of a better time to talk about draining the swamp. After all, we’ve got swampy weather. Plus a president whose administration is setting records for boggy behavior. ’Tis the season. People, what do you think originally inspired Donald Trump’s promise to “drain the swamp” if he was elected? Do you think he repressed the whole matter of his tax returns? The hush money payments to Stormy and Company? He did say during his campaign that the swamp was the “entire corrupt Washington establishment,” so maybe he presumed that slimy things occurring in New York or Florida didn’t count. Ah, well, let’s look ahead. Autumn is coming, temperatures will be falling and the Democrats will be running on a neo-Drainage platform. “The swamp has never been more foul or more fetid than under this president,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, when he and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi held a press conference on the steps of the Capitol to unveil a good-government agenda called “A Better Deal for Our Democracy.” It’s part of the overall Democratic election theme “A Better Deal.” Pop Quiz: Which do you think is the superior campaign slogan?   A) A Better Deal   B) The New Deal   C) The Fair Deal   D) Deal or No Deal O.K., the last one was an old quiz show. On the reform front, Better Deal has a lot of pieces, like making it easier for people to register to vote, increasing the political power of small donors and stronger ethics guidelines. "
1434,"Most hospitals are nonprofit and justify their exemption from taxation with community service and charity care. But the Trump administration could require some of them to do more to help the poor, and the hospitals that are in the cross-hairs are those benefiting from an obscure drug discount program known as 340B. The 340B program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to sell drugs at steep discounts to certain hospitals serving larger proportions of low-income and vulnerable people, such as children or cancer patients. The participating hospitals may charge insurers and public programs like Medicare and Medicaid more for those drugs than they paid for them and keep the difference. By one estimate, the program saved hospitals $6 billion in 2015 alone. The original intent of the program, enacted in 1992, was for hospitals to use the revenue to provide more low-income patients a broader range of services. Many institutions that serve mostly low-income and uninsured populations say they need the program. “Most nonprofit hospitals have very slim profit margins, and they’ve come to rely on this revenue,” said Melinda Buntin, chairwoman of the Department of Health Policy at Vanderbilt School of Medicine. A hospital lobbying group said that for some rural hospitals, the funding cut “could actually be the difference between staying open and closing.” But there is concern that 340B has come to include hospitals that don’t need the extra help and are not using its windfall as originally intended. The program has grown considerably, most recently as a result of an expansion included in the Affordable Care Act. As of 2004, about 200 hospitals benefited from the 340B program; by 2015, over 1,000 were participating. The program now encompasses 40 percent of all hospitals and an even larger number of hospital-affiliated clinics and pharmacies. "
1435,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday tried to make China the scapegoat for his stalled diplomacy with North Korea, accusing it of undermining the American-led pressure campaign against Pyongyang because of an escalating trade dispute with the United States. In a series of late-afternoon tweets, issued under the headline “Statement From the White House,” Mr. Trump said China was shipping “money, fuel,  fertilizer and various other commodities” to North Korea. “This is not helpful!” he added, consistently referring to himself in the third person. China lashed back hours later, accusing Mr. Trump of “magical logic.” Even as he was criticizing China, Mr. Trump reaffirmed his decision in June to suspend joint military exercises with South Korea, saying they were costly and unnecessary, given his warm relationship with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. While it was difficult to decipher the strategy behind the tweets, the president appeared in part to be trying to dial back remarks made by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who opened the door on Tuesday to resuming the exercises.

The world’s two superpowers have locked tusks over tariffs, and the rest of the world — especially Asia — seems in danger of being trampled. As the trade war heads into its third month, with the United States set to impose a new tranche of $200 billion in tariffs this fall, expanding the conflict fourfold, one truth is clearer than ever: In a globalized economy, nothing exists in isolation. There is no such thing as a trade war of surgical strikes, in which tariffs hit their targets and leave everything around them unscathed. In its attempt to punish China for unfair trade practices and to reduce a $375 billion trade deficit, the Trump administration is also inflicting harm on some of America’s allies in Asia — forcing them, like ants under the elephants’ feet, to scramble in search of escape. Consider the predicament of Vietnam. China and the United States, which each have their own violent histories in Vietnam, are now that country’s most important trading partners. Together, the giants gobbled up roughly 35 percent of Vietnam’s exports last year, furthering its transformation from sleepy purveyor of rice and coffee to manufacturing hub. When the trade war broke out, so did the ominous headlines in Hanoi. A rapid devaluation of the Chinese yuan sparked a brief run on Vietnam’s currency and a drop in its stock market. Rumors spread about an influx of cheap Chinese consumer goods and the threat of American protectionism spreading in ways that would affect Vietnam’s vital exports. And there was a tangible concern: Nearly $5 billion of Vietnamese exports are part of China’s value-added supply chain, meaning they may feel the impact of being exposed to punitive American tariffs. Soon another sort of reaction began taking place. Driven by the dangers of the trade war, many foreign companies with stakes in China — those ants underfoot — have started shifting production away from China to Southeast Asia. One sign of this development was on display in mid-July, when a group of visitors showed up on Vietnam’s northern coast near Ha Long Bay. The men in white shirts and dark ties were not tourists. They represented 72 Japanese businesses, in industries ranging from textiles to electronics, and they were looking for economic refuge. “Many of these Japanese firms have been operating in China,” Nguyen Duc Tiep, an official from the local-investment promotion center, told a Vietnamese magazine. “They want to expand their investment markets out of China to shun risks caused by the nation’s rising production costs and by the U.S.-China trade war, which is making it hard for Japanese firms to export their products to the U.S. from China.” The Japanese businessmen may be among the trade war’s first economic victims. But the shift of manufacturing away from China is not a new phenomenon. Over the past few years, as wages in Chinese factories have risen sharply, many companies, foreign and Chinese alike, have begun moving at least some of their operations to Southeast Asia to take advantage of lower production costs. In Vietnam, where wages are barely a third of those in China, Adidas now makes twice as many shoes as it does in China, and Intel and Samsung Electronics have made billion-dollar investments there. The country’s export-led growth depends on attracting foreign investment, and now American and Chinese policies may be hastening its arrival. “For many companies, the trade conflict is a catalyst to explore changes they hadn’t contemplated before,” says Jon Cowley, a tax-and-trade partner at the law firm Baker McKenzie in Hong Kong. “For others, it’s an accelerant to a process they’d already started. The trade conflict is just pushing them over the finish line.” It is still early in the trade war, only two months in, so many of these corporate moves are just taking shape. Still, the race is on to secure excess manufacturing capacity all around the region — in Thailand, Indonesia and elsewhere. In late July, Delta Electronics, a Taiwanese producer of Apple power components, approved a $2.14 billion buyout of its Thai affiliate to cope with the growing trade risks. Also this summer, Hong Kong’s Techtronic Industries (T.T.I.), the maker of Hoover vacuum cleaners and Milwaukee power tools, opened a new plant in Vietnam and another, its sixth, in the United States. Some 76 percent of T.T.I.’s revenue comes from North America. “We have always said we won’t want all our eggs in one basket,” the company’s chief executive, Joseph Galli, said in August, stressing the importance of “a flexible supply chain.” "
1437,"A historic upset overturned Democratic politics in Florida, as Andrew Gillum, the liberal 39-year-old mayor of Tallahassee, overcame several aggressive opponents to become the first black nominee for governor in the state’s history. He campaigned on a bluntly liberal message, calling for a single-payer-style health care system at the state level, and he earned Bernie Sanders’ endorsement and crucial financial support from mega-donors on the left like Tom Steyer and George Soros. His victory caps a season of breakthroughs for African-American Democrats running for powerful governorships, including next door in Georgia, where Stacey Abrams could become the country’s first black female governor, and in Maryland, where Democrats nominated Ben Jealous, a former president of the N.A.A.C.P. Mr. Gillum is likely to face a difficult fight in the general election against Representative Ron DeSantis, the G.O.P. nominee who is a vocal ally of President Trump, and Republicans have already signaled that they intend to brand Mr. Gillum as outside the political mainstream of his traditionally moderate state. And in what may be a painful irony for some Democrats, Mr. Gillum’s win was also a stinging loss for Gwen Graham, a former member of Congress who had hoped to become Florida’s first female governor. Though she was seen as the front-runner going into the primary, Ms. Graham finished second, ahead of three wealthy male opponents but about 3 percentage points behind Mr. Gillum. Mr. DeSantis was not the only Trump loyalist nominated for office on Tuesday night. Joining him were Rick Scott, the Florida governor, who is running for Senate against the Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson, and Representative Martha McSally, who won the G.O.P. nomination for an open Senate seat in Arizona.

1439,"WASHINGTON — Fallout from the trade war between the United States and China has prompted Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire media executive and former mayor of New York City, to relocate what was planned as a conference of global business and political leaders in Beijing to rival Davos, the elite annual conclave in Switzerland. Organizers in New York are moving the event to Singapore, where it is to take place over two days in the first week of November. Mr. Bloomberg made the decision after a Chinese partner asked organizers last week to postpone the event, according to people with knowledge of the planning. Instead, the partner told organizers, President Xi Jinping and other leaders in China want to spotlight an import expo in Shanghai to bolster international interest in trade with the country. The move highlights the difficulty of conducting business — or diplomacy — in China, both because of rising tensions with the United States and because of an accelerating move toward hard authoritarianism under Mr. Xi. The relationship between Washington and Beijing has become increasingly fraught because of the trade war started by President Trump over the summer, and Chinese officials are more likely to question American-led events in China, even those that aim to bring business leaders there. On Wednesday afternoon, President Trump said on Twitter that the trade dispute would be “resolved in time” by him and “China’s great President Xi Jinping.” “Their relationship and bond remain very strong,” he said, continuing to refer to himself in the third person. The Shanghai event, announced by Mr. Xi last year, has taken on new significance for Chinese leaders because of the trade war, which has lasted much longer than they had anticipated, the people said. "
1440,"HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. — After months of shadowboxing from afar, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Cynthia Nixon clashed up close in a heated debate on Wednesday that featured sharp attacks, flashes of frustration and two competing visions for the Democratic Party and New York. They fought over standing up to President Trump, the subways, releasing their tax returns, health care policy and corruption convictions in the Cuomo administration. For much of the hour, they jabbed and counterpunched, talking over each other repeatedly and accusing each other of distortions, as Mr. Cuomo said Ms. Nixon lives in “the world of fiction.” “Can you stop interrupting?” Mr. Cuomo said to her at one point. “Can you stop lying?” Ms. Nixon snapped back. Mr. Cuomo paused. “As soon as you do,” he answered. The attacks and contours of the debate echoed some of the same tensions that are gripping the Democratic Party nationally in the age of Trump: namely, whether the path back to power and success must be led by seasoned political veterans or to-the-barricades outside agitators. For Ms. Nixon, the actress and activist undertaking a long-shot challenge against a two-term incumbent, the debate offered her biggest stage yet in the race, and she used the spotlight to rip Mr. Cuomo as a “corrupt corporate Democrat” while promising an array of progressive policies she said he had bottled up in the last seven years. “I’m not an Albany insider like Governor Cuomo, but experience doesn’t mean that much if you’re not actually good at governing,” she accused.

1441,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up for our Climate Fwd: newsletter. WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is reviewing a major Obama-era clean air regulation on the emission of mercury — a pollutant linked with damage to the brain, to the nervous system and to fetal development — with the intent of proposing a replacement rule, a spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday. The E.P.A.’s review of the 2011 mercury rule comes amid a string of initiatives by the Trump administration to roll back or weaken many environmental regulations put forth by the Obama administration. After reviewing the rule, a process which typically takes 60 to 90 days, the E.P.A. will issue a proposed replacement rule, the agency spokeswoman, Molly Block, said in an email. The mercury regulation under review chiefly affects pollution from coal-fired power plants. The move comes as President Trump has pressed forward on numerous fronts in an attempt to meet his campaign pledge to revive the nation’s coal industry, despite economic analyses showing that the decline in demand for coal is largely driven by market forces rather than regulations. Last week, the E.P.A. proposed a new rule designed to replace the Clean Power Plan, another major Obama-era regulation governing coal-fired power plants. That rule would have restricted coal plants’ emission of a different pollutant: carbon dioxide, one of the chief causes of global warming. At the time the Obama administration put forth the mercury regulations, which took more than 20 years to formulate, E.P.A. officials estimated they would save thousands of lives and return economic and health benefits many times their estimated $9.6 billion annual cost. "
1442,"During the presidential campaign, in the spring of 2016, the Republican front-runner Donald Trump sat down for an interview with Bob Woodward and Robert Costa of The Washington Post. They quoted President Barack Obama on global power and foreign affairs saying that “real power means you can get what you want without having to exert violence.” They then asked Trump if he agreed. Trump responded: “Well, I think there’s a certain truth to that. I think there’s a certain truth to that. Real power is through respect. Real power is, I don’t even want to use the word, fear.” Woodward made “Fear” the title of his forthcoming book about Trump. Trump has found — or has always had — a winning populism perfectly suited for this moment in our history, when the anxious, scared, hateful and callous desire an unapologetic voice that has the backing of actual power. Trump’s magical mixture is to make being afraid feel like fun. His rallies are a hybrid of concert revelry and combat prep. Trump tells his followers about all the things of which they should be afraid, or shouldn’t trust or should hate, and then positions himself as the greatest defense against those things. His supporters roar their approval at their white knight. Fear is the poison-tipped arrow in Trump’s quiver. He launches it whenever he needs to change the subject, justify his callousness and racism, or defend himself from critique. "
1443,"In his firmest denial of presidential ambitions yet, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday that, if re-elected this year, he would finish a full third term as New York’s governor — or die trying. “The only caveat is if God strikes me dead,” Mr. Cuomo said during Wednesday night’s debate with Cynthia Nixon. Mr. Cuomo, as a 60-year-old two-term governor of a major state, has long been considered a possible contender for national office. And in recent months, as he has increasingly redirected his administration to stand in opposition to President Trump’s agenda in Washington, that talk has only grown. Earlier in August, Mr. Cuomo announced opening his first federal political action committee, and he engaged in a war of words with Mr. Trump after he had declared that America “was never that great.” “A total meltdown!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. Mr. Cuomo retorted, “What you say would be ‘great again’ would not be great at all ... We will not go back to discrimination, segregation, sexism, isolationism, racism or the KKK.” Mr. Cuomo rarely ventured into national issues — or even out of New York State — early in his governorship, but he has honed his image opposing the president. “Someone has to stand up to him, someone has to stop him,” Mr. Cuomo said during the debate against Ms. Nixon, who is challenging him in the Sept. 13 Democratic primary. There is a long history of reputed presidential ambitions in the Cuomo family, dating back to Mr. Cuomo’s father, the former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who considered running for president in 1988 and 1992 before stepping aside both times. The 1988 decision “shocked even some of his highest aides,” The New York Times reported at the time. In 1992, two chartered planes were waiting on the tarmac in Albany waiting to whisk Mr. Cuomo to New Hampshire when he pulled the plug, earning the moniker, “Hamlet on the Hudson,” for his indecisiveness. Andrew Cuomo’s mid-debate pledge would seem to douse any talk of indecision. Mr. Cuomo was asked if he would pledge to serve a full four years if re-elected as governor; a third term would not end until Dec. 31, 2022. “Yes,” he said. “Yes, yes and yes. Double yes.” Then, as politicians are wont to do, he offered that “only caveat.” The crowd moaned as the suspense built. Then Mr. Cuomo silenced them with his promise of serving four years unless God and death intervened. "
1444,"Once again, there was text and subtext, and as often with this president, both were disturbing. At a private meeting on Monday, President Trump urged evangelical Christian leaders to break federal law and openly support him from the pulpit. Does it matter that he seemed to believe that he had overturned the provision of the tax code that prevents churches from endorsing or opposing political candidates? Truth, fantasy and deceit slosh together with Mr. Trump. What mattered more was the thought that Mr. Trump planted — that a deluge of violence and anarchy would be loosed upon the world if they failed to rally the nation’s Christian soldiers to his side. If the Democrats win the midterm elections, the president warned, “they will overturn everything that we’ve done and they’ll do it quickly and violently, and violently.” “The level of hatred, the level of anger is unbelievable,” he said. Of course, the only political leader who has been inciting and condoning violence has been Mr. Trump. At campaign rallies he fantasized about punching a foe in the face and urged his crowds to “knock the crap out of” protesters, offering to pay their legal bills if they did. Reporters at his rallies have feared for their safety as they faced the “enemy of the people” fury Mr. Trump has sought to foment among his most passionate supporters. When torch-bearing neo-Nazis marched in Virginia last year, and one even ran his car into a crowd of counter-demonstrators, killing a woman, Mr. Trump said there was “blame on both sides.” While Mr. Trump tried to terrify the ministers with the threat of “antifa” or anti-fascist activists who occasionally disrupt right-wing demonstrations, we can safely say the president’s real fear is not that tiny group of violent provocateurs, but democracy itself — the millions of Americans who have been quietly going to the polls to reject him and the candidates he supports and may continue to do so in midterm elections this fall. "
1445,"President Trump attacked CNN on Wednesday, writing on Twitter that the network had been “caught in a major lie” in connection to an article it published in July about claims made by the president’s former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen. The article, which was written by Jim Sciutto, Marshall Cohen and Carl Bernstein, the high-profile Watergate reporter, said Mr. Cohen was claiming that Mr. Trump knew in advance about a now infamous June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in which Russians were expected to offer damaging information on Hillary Clinton. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is investigating possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia’s election interference. In the meantime, a flurry of statements in recent days from Mr. Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny J. Davis, has, for some, muddied the water around the sourcing and validity of CNN’s report. In essence, Mr. Davis has admitted he was an unnamed source for the article, and has backed away from the claims he made about Mr. Cohen. (More on this later.) Mr. Trump, who has long been a vocal critic of the network, seemed on Wednesday to seize the opportunity to renew his disapproval. “CNN is being torn apart from within based on their being caught in a major lie and refusing to admit the mistake,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “Sloppy @carlbernstein, a man who lives in the past and thinks like a degenerate fool, making up story after story, is being laughed at all over the country! Fake News.” "
1446,"WASHINGTON — Not long after Senator John McCain learned last summer that he had terminal brain cancer, he began convening meetings every Friday in his Capitol Hill office with a group of trusted aides. The subject was his funeral. He obsessed over the music, selecting the Irish ballad “Danny Boy” and several patriotic hymns. He choreographed the movement of his coffin from Arizona, his home state, to Washington. And in April, when he knew the end was coming, he began reaching out to Republicans, Democrats and even a Russian dissident with requests that they deliver eulogies and serve as pallbearers. By the time he died on Saturday, Mr. McCain had carefully stage-managed a four-day celebration of his life — but what was also an unmistakable rebuke to President Trump and his agenda. For years, Mr. Trump had used Twitter and the presidential bully pulpit to mock and condemn the senator. In death, Mr. McCain found a way to have the last word, even quietly making it clear through friends that Mr. Trump was not welcome at the services. “I think it’s fair to say that they have a very different view of this country and what this country means, here and abroad,” said Mark Salter, the senator’s longtime friend and co-author who sat with Mr. McCain — often with a lump in his throat — during the many discussions about his looming death. “His overall message was: ‘It doesn’t have to be this shitty.’” The series of events honoring Mr. McCain is the kind of grandiose spectacle that is normally reserved for someone who became president, not someone who twice failed to do so. Friends said that Mr. McCain was surprised by the level of interest in his death even as he planned it. When advisers suggested that his coffin should lie in state at the Arizona Capitol, Mr. McCain said he believed the legislature would never approve such a rare honor for him, recalled Rick Davis, who had been at Mr. McCain’s side for decades and served as his 2008 campaign chairman. "
1447,"HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. — The lone debate in the Democratic primary pitting Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo against his challenger, Cynthia Nixon, featured its fair share of brickbats and bon mots. Here’s a quick look at some of the candidates’ statements, and when they may have stretched the truth. Mr. Cuomo has seemingly sought to make the race less about Ms. Nixon and more about President Trump, who has dismal approval ratings in his home state. Mr. Cuomo said that he was “in a fight” with Mr. Trump and said that the president uses Twitter to attack him “weekly.” “Know me by my enemies,” the governor said in the early moments of the debate. But while Mr. Cuomo has recently been on the receiving end of some negative attention from the president’s Twitter account after saying that America “was never that great,” the governor has not always been on Mr. Trump’s bad side. Indeed, the two men have known each other for decades — Mr. Trump even recorded a video for the governor’s 1990 bachelor party — and Mr. Trump has given tens of thousands of dollars to the governor’s political campaigns. Mr. Cuomo has declined to return those donations, saying he wants to use the money to fight the president’s agenda, earning Ms. Nixon’s scorn. [“Can you stop interrupting?” “Can you stop lying? Read our live coverage of the debate. How did the candidates do? Here are six takeaways.] Ms. Nixon has consistently attacked Mr. Cuomo for his stewardship of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that runs the delay-ridden subway system and which the governor effectively controls. "
1448,"When a British-Iranian charity worker was abruptly released from a Tehran prison last week on a three-day leave and allowed to see her daughter, joy erupted among supporters in Britain, where her case has received extraordinary attention. But when her request for an extension was denied, the elation turned to despair and anger. Then on Wednesday, the prisoner collapsed and was hospitalized over what her husband described as recurrent panic attacks. The plight of the prisoner, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a 40-year-old representative of the Thomson Reuters Foundation who was arrested in Iran more than two years ago, is not unique. Critics of Iran’s opaque judicial system say foreign citizens — particularly Britons and Americans of Iranian descent — are often subject to capricious prosecution on vaguely defined political offenses. Here are some questions and answers about Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe and some other high-profile foreign citizens known to be incarcerated in Iran. Iranian officials have never been clear about precisely why Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a dual citizen, was taken into custody, but her connections to the Thomson Reuters Foundation, which promotes freedom of expression, may have something to do with it. She was arrested on April 3, 2016, after visiting family members in Iran, where she was traveling with her daughter, Gabriella, then 22 months old. Agents of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps took her into custody as she and Gabriella were about to board a flight home to Britain, and the child was placed in the custody of her maternal grandparents. "
1449,"WASHINGTON — Democratic nominees for governor include three African-Americans, two of them in the old Confederacy, a prospect that not long ago would have been unthinkable. Record numbers of women are competing in congressional races. Elsewhere, Muslims, gays, lesbians and transgender people will be on the ballot for high-profile offices. That diverse cast is teeing up a striking contrast for voters in November at a time when some in the Republican Party, taking their cues from President Trump, are embracing messages with explicit appeals to racial anxieties and resentment. The result is making racial and ethnic issues and conflicts central in the November elections in a way that’s far more explicit than the recent past. Mr. Trump and his Republican allies have made crime, violence, gangs and societal unrest a centerpiece of their attacks against Democrats in this election, often linking them to causes that have a common racial thread — the policies of liberal leaders in heavily minority cities, illegal immigration and Mr. Trump’s continuing campaign impugning the patriotism of professional athletes, many of whom are black. A possible preview played out Wednesday barely 12 hours after Andrew Gillum, the African-American mayor of Tallahassee, won a surprising victory in Florida’s Democratic primary for governor. Mr. Gillum’s opponent, Ron DeSantis, described Mr. Gillum in an interview on Fox News as an “articulate spokesman” for far-left views and said voters should not take a gamble on him because he would “monkey this up” — referring to the progress made under Florida’s current Republican governor, Rick Scott. Democrats immediately denounced Mr. DeSantis’s words, which are freighted with a condescending and racist meaning for many black people. Fox News issued a rare statement disavowing the remarks. Mr. DeSantis, who paid homage to the president in a campaign ad showing him teaching his daughter to read by sounding out “Make America Great Again” from a Trump placard, insisted that he was being purposely taken out of context. "
1450,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Andrew Gillum waged a quixotic Democratic primary campaign for Florida governor, defeating wealthy rivals who outspent him, dismissing moderate naysayers who questioned him and believing until the end that an unorthodox strategy of excitement generated mostly by word of mouth would propel him to victory. He dropped in on community groups, no matter how small, to make personal connections. He cold-called would-be donors who, truth be told, sometimes hung up on him. Just a month before the election, he was so worried that few voters knew that he, the 39-year-old African-American mayor of Tallahassee, was on the ballot that his campaign spent its scarce funds on an unusual political advertising device: highway billboards. “I did some things that nobody would ever advise a campaign,” Mr. Gillum said with a laugh on Wednesday, the day after his improbable victory, which he spent making cable news appearances and fielding congratulatory phone calls. Now comes the difficult part, as Mr. Gillum prepares to deal with attacks he avoided in the primary — including over a lingering F.B.I. investigation into Tallahassee City Hall — and with ugly matters of race that emerged hours after his election. His Republican opponent, Representative Ron DeSantis, said in a Fox News interview on Wednesday that a “socialist agenda” in Florida would “monkey this up” in alluding to progress under Republicans in Florida. Democrats heard racist dog whistles. For Mr. Gillum, the sound was a little louder. "
1451,"— President Trump, in remarks on Wednesday at the White House Mr. Trump is right that Puerto Rico’s electric utility had declared bankruptcy and that the power grid was plagued with issues before Hurricane Maria ravaged the island last September. But it is not accurate to suggest that people had no electricity before the hurricane. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or Prepa, was widely criticized in September 2016, when a fire knocked a power plant offline and left 1.5 million people without electricity for three days. After the cutoff, a Puerto Rico Energy Commission report noted that Prepa had failed to safely and reliably supply electricity. It concluded that customers experienced interruption rates four to five times higher than other American utilities and that its “transmission and distribution systems are falling apart quite literally.” On top of the litany of management and infrastructure issues outlined in the report, Prepa has also been in financial distress for years and, straddled with $9 billion of bond debt, effectively filed for bankruptcy in July 2017. So it is clear that Puerto Rico’s power utility was in terrible shape before the hurricane. Residents, however, still had electricity, as evidenced by satellite images from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, taken both before and after the hurricane hit the island. "
1452,"There was some applause when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo offered that he had tried marijuana in college, and even some laughter when he wryly noted that the public would have a better sense of Cynthia Nixon’s personal worth if she released more tax returns. But at a debate watch party at Syndicated, a popular movie theater-bar-restaurant hybrid in the heart of gentrifying Brooklyn, that was about the sum of the accolades for Mr. Cuomo. Long before the start of Wednesday night’s debate between Mr. Cuomo and Ms. Nixon — their first and only before next month’s primary — it became obvious that the governor was not in for a warm reception. A man in a Cynthia Nixon T-shirt chatted with another man at the bar; across from them was one sporting a Bernie Sanders shirt. Another, in a shirt emblazoned with “Abolish ICE,” scanned the room for a seat. At around 6 p.m., an hour before the debate aired, the sleek, high-ceilinged room was mostly empty; by 6:30 p.m., there was hardly room to navigate. By the time the debate began at 7 p.m., sweaty elbows were pressed against sweaty arms, and even the candidates wouldn’t have argued that the temperature in the room had soared well past comfortable. A moderator, WCBS-TV’s Maurice DuBois, first introduced Mr. Cuomo — silence — and then Ms. Nixon — rousing applause. And they were off. For the next hour, the crowd — mostly white, mostly in their 20s or 30s, and almost all, by the sound of it, backing Ms. Nixon — scoffed at Mr. Cuomo’s opening nod to Senator John McCain, or his blaming of President Trump. (“Talk about you, homie.”) The cheers for Ms. Nixon’s accusation that Mr. Cuomo had empowered Republican control of the State Senate were tremendous; those for her description of legalizing recreational marijuana as a racial justice issue, deafening. [The debate offered competing visions for New York and the Democratic Party.] The disapproval for Mr. Cuomo was so loud, and so ready, that the crowd barely seemed to hear some of his wittier rejoinders — for example, when he promised Ms. Nixon to stop lying “as soon as you do.” "
1453,"WASHINGTON — Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is preparing new policies on campus sexual misconduct that would bolster the rights of students accused of assault, harassment or rape, reduce liability for institutions of higher education and encourage schools to provide more support for victims. The proposed rules, obtained by The New York Times, narrow the definition of sexual harassment, holding schools accountable only for formal complaints filed through proper authorities and for conduct said to have occurred on their campuses. They would also establish a higher legal standard to determine whether schools improperly addressed complaints. The new rules would come at a particularly sensitive time, as major institutions such as Ohio State University, the University of Southern California and Michigan State University deal with explosive charges that members of their faculty and staff have perpetrated serious sexual misconduct. But for several years, higher education administrators have maintained that sexual misconduct rules pressed by the Obama administration unnecessarily burdened them with bureaucratic mandates that had little to do with assault or harassment, and men’s rights groups have said the accused have had little recourse. Unlike the Obama administration’s guidance documents, the Trump administration’s new rules will have the force of law and can go into force without an act of Congress, after a public comment period. Liz Hill, an Education Department spokeswoman, said on Wednesday that the department was “in the midst of a deliberative process.” She added that any information obtained by The Times “is premature and speculative, and therefore, we have no comment.” Last fall, Ms. DeVos rescinded a 2011 letter prepared by the Obama administration that outlined the responsibilities of schools and colleges that receive federal funding to address episodes of sexual misconduct. Victims rights groups praised the Obama-era guidelines for aggressively holding schools accountable for complaints of sexual harassment, assault and rape that they said had often been played down or ignored. But critics contended that too often they trampled due-process rights for accused students. "

Here’s what you need to know: • In one of the biggest upsets of the primary season, Andrew Gillum defeated Gwen Graham on Tuesday to become the Democratic nominee for governor. Here’s our story about the elections in Florida, Arizona and Oklahoma. Mr. Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee and an outspoken progressive, would be Florida’s first black governor if he beats Representative Ron DeSantis, who won the Republican nomination, in the November election. Mr. DeSantis is a close ally of President Trump. In Arizona, Representative Martha McSally won the primary to replace one of Mr. Trump’s most outspoken Republican critics in the Senate, Jeff Flake. She defeated two right-wing candidates, including the former sheriff Joe Arpaio. • Here are four takeaways from Tuesday’s voting as well as the full results. • Canadian officials were scrambling to reach a compromise on Tuesday that would keep the country in the North American Free Trade Agreement, after the U.S. threatened to exclude it from a deal with Mexico. The Trump administration said it would seek congressional approval to complete a revised version of the longstanding pact, with or without Canada, by Friday. "
1457,"If there is a silver lining to the recent trade insanity, it’s the bright light that it shines on the victims of President Trump’s tariffs. These victims include construction companies, equipment manufacturers and the many American producers whose costs are increasing. Workers in these industries as well as ordinary American consumers pay higher prices for automobiles, washers and dryers, and the other goods whose prices are artificially hiked by the tariffs. Because of the president’s hyperactive use of his trade authority, the scale of this pain is unusually high. But the reality is that this disregard for the consequences inflicted on buyers in the industries downstream from tariffs is nothing new. In fact, thanks to the handiwork of interest groups who benefit from the tariffs and the politicians who serve them, it’s embedded in our trade system, sometimes even in the legislation itself. Consider how easy it was for Mr. Trump to get a 25 percent tariff on steel imports. His administration simply concocted a fanciful national-security narrative about why the steel industry needed protection from foreign steel imports — this despite the industry’s enjoying a 70 percent share of the United States steel market and despite the Department of Defense finding no national-security harm from global steel imports. Why is such a half-baked justification so easy to spin? In large part, it has to do with the Commerce Department, which is responsible for measuring a given tariff’s impact. A department report on a tariff measures the direct impact on an industry — say, steel manufacturers — as well as steel-consuming industries and the economy more broadly. However, while it has the data, the Department of Commerce is not required by law to consider the impact on the industries in the cross hairs of a tariff in its recommendation to impose the penalty — even though the impact can be brutal. For example, for the projected impact of the steel tariffs, numbers produced by the Commerce Department show that they may increase employment in the metals industry by 14,000 jobs. But the report also says that a significantly larger number of jobs will be destroyed, as a result of these tariffs, in industries downstream from metal production. "
1458,"Good morning on this still-scalding Wednesday. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and his Democratic rival, Cynthia Nixon, go head-to-head tonight in a debate at Hofstra University. (It will be shown on tape delay on WCBS-TV at 7 p.m.) It will be their first and only debate. [Read our story about what to watch.] But it’s not the first time an actor or TV star has been a key contender for office. Jerry Springer became a mayor. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a governor. Al Franken, a senator. Ronald Reagan, a president. (And then there’s President Trump.) So how can having a background in acting, as Ms. Nixon does, help, or hurt, a candidate, especially in a debate? We asked the longtime debate coach Aubrey Semple, program director for the New York City Urban Debate League, to weigh in. What are the pros of having an acting background in the political arena? “You’ve got to remember that debate is performance,” he said. “As viewers, we serve as spectators — we watch the debates because we want to be informed, but let’s not kid ourselves: We also want to be entertained.” "
1459,"SEOUL, South Korea — President Moon Jae-in of South Korea sees a more urgent need to travel to North Korea next month and meet with its leader, Kim Jong-un, now that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s planned trip there this week has been canceled, Mr. Moon’s office said on Wednesday. North and South Korea had earlier agreed to hold a third summit meeting in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, next month. But Mr. Moon had hoped that Mr. Pompeo would break a logjam in talks over denuclearizing the North, making it easier for him to push his agenda of increasing economic and other inter-Korean ties when he sat down with Mr. Kim. Mr. Moon’s plan was cast into doubt after President Trump last Friday abruptly canceled Mr. Pompeo’s trip. But on Wednesday, Mr. Moon’s office said he was intent on working as a mediator between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump, just as he helped broker their first meeting in June. “Now that North Korea and the United States remain deadlocked, a new South-North Korean summit meeting, if anything, will play an even bigger role in helping resolve problems and overcoming obstacles,” Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman for Mr. Moon, said Wednesday. In Washington on Tuesday, Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, did not voice an objection to another meeting of the Korean leaders but reminded Mr. Moon of his repeated promise to keep any progress in inter-Korean relations tied to progress in denuclearizing the North.

1460,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. With yesterday’s voting in Arizona, Florida and Oklahoma, the 2018 primary season is almost over. Only five states — all in the Northeast, including Massachusetts and New York — have yet to vote, and each will do so over the next couple of weeks. All told, the primary season has been quite good for Democrats. They have largely avoided nominating weak candidates in winnable districts. They have kept their focus on economic issues, where the public tends to support Democratic positions (as opposed to social issues or impeachment, on which voters are more evenly split). Meanwhile, President Trump continued acting in ways that have kept his approval ratings in the low 40s. Last night’s results continued the trend. Combined, Arizona and Florida have nine House districts that Democrats have a legitimate chance to flip, according to the Cook Political Report. Solid Democratic candidates won the primaries in all nine. In Florida’s 15th, a suburban district, The Tampa Bay Times said that Kristen Carlson, a former prosecutor, was the best fit, and she won the nomination. In Arizona’s 6th, outside Phoenix, a nurse practitioner named Heather Ross, who favors expanding Medicare, will face David Schweikert, a Republican incumbent who tried to repeal Obamacare — and who has ethical problems. (Primary ballots are still being counted, and the Democrat in second place, Anita Malik, is also a strong candidate.) None of this guarantees that Democrats will retake the House in November. The party will need to continue running a strong campaign and, in all likelihood, an unusually strong turnout for a midterm. But as primary season comes to a close, it has mostly helped the Democrats’ chances. Arguably, the most complicated result for Democrats last night was the one that received the most attention. In the Florida governor's primary, Andrew Gillum — the mayor of Tallahassee, endorsed by Bernie Sanders — won a victory many progressives are celebrating. Yet some political analysts think a losing candidate — Gwen Graham, a former congresswoman — had a better chance of winning the general election this fall. Even if those analysts are right, though, I think the congressional races are more important than any governor’s race. Only if Democrats retake Congress will Trump face any serious accountability for the damage he is doing, as my colleague Michelle Goldberg explained this week. Elsewhere: Ella Nilson of Vox and Benjamin Wallace-Wells of The New Yorker profile Gillum and explain why he has excited so many people on the left. "
1461,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Self-flying cars are not here. But this past week in Tracy, Calif., a tech start-up called SkyRyse began testing a new emergency response service that it sees as a (small and careful) step toward passenger aircraft that can fly on their own. Due for launch in January, the service will shuttle police officers and medical workers across the San Joaquin Valley via a helicopter equipped with the kind of sensors that power driverless cars. A radar sensor, for instance, provides a detailed view of the aircraft’s surroundings even in bad weather, not unlike the laser sensors used by the autonomous cars that are now being tested in places like Arizona and Texas. At the moment, these sensors operate alongside seasoned pilots. But they will gather enormous amounts of flight data that can feed the creation of systems that can fly the helicopter on their own. In another echo of the work inside the makers of self-driving cars, SkyRyse engineers are using this data to build simulations of real-world flying conditions that can help test these systems. SkyRyse is just one of many companies pushing toward this kind of technology, including Xwing, another Northern California start-up, and Uber, the ride-hailing company that is also building driverless cars. Uber is one of several companies working toward a kind of “flying taxi service.” The end game is still years away. And getting there will be enormously difficult, in part because passenger flight is very heavily regulated. Even if companies like SkyRyse can deliver self-flying aircraft, convincing regulators of its safety is another matter. “There are a lot of start-ups doing this,” said Igor Cherepinsky, director of autonomy programs at Sikorsky, a division of the defense contractor Lockheed Martin. “Quite a few of them are naïve about what it will take.” "

1463,"WASHINGTON — President Trump surprised Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, on Wednesday by abruptly announcing that Mr. McGahn will be leaving his job this fall, effectively forcing the long-anticipated exit of a top adviser who has cooperated extensively in the investigation into Russian election interference. The president made the declaration on Twitter without first informing Mr. McGahn, according to people close to both men. It came 11 days after The New York Times reported the degree to which Mr. McGahn — who was by Mr. Trump’s side at major moments as the president sought to keep control of the Russia inquiry — has emerged as a key witness in the investigation. Over the past nine months Mr. McGahn has given 30 hours of testimony in at least three voluntary interviews. Mr. McGahn’s departure leaves the White House without one of the few senior advisers who have been willing to push back against Mr. Trump. It also raised the prospect of further West Wing exits, particularly in the White House Counsel’s Office, where Mr. McGahn has had a loyal staff, with several people staying in their jobs out of devotion to him. Mr. McGahn had long discussed his intention to leave at some point, but the way Mr. Trump blindsided him with a tweet underscored how dysfunctional the relationship had become, even as the Russia inquiry appears to be reaching a critical phase, and the legal scrutiny is mounting for the president. Mr. Trump’s decision did not appear to be a direct response to the disclosure that Mr. McGahn had been cooperating closely with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III — a fact his team was aware of — though its timing inevitably led to questions about whether the president was cutting loose an aide who he believed had provided damaging information about him. [The White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, has cooperated extensively in the Mueller inquiry.] But Wednesday afternoon at the White House, Mr. Trump praised Mr. McGahn and said he had nothing to fear about what his counsel had told Mr. Mueller, even as he appeared to confirm that he was not completely aware what that was. "
1464,"BUCHAREST, Romania — Romania, long considered one of the most corrupt states in the European Union, has made energetic efforts to root out graft that has entangled prominent lawmakers. Some have pushed back, angering corruption-weary citizens who have rallied by the tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands. Now, unexpectedly, Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, has waded into the debate on the side of the accused, sending a letter to Romania’s president, Klaus Iohannis, criticizing the country’s anticorruption efforts. The letter, dated Aug. 22, expressed concern about the “continuing damage to the rule of law being done under the guise of effective law enforcement” in Romania — a position that seemed at odds with official United States policy. Mr. Giuliani wrote that an amnesty should be given to those who had been convicted in the crackdown, citing the “excesses” of the country’s anticorruption agency. The letter prompted a raft of comment after it was published in the Romanian news media this week. Its authenticity has not been challenged. Romania, which joined the European Union in 2007, has been praised for its efforts to rein in graft in recent years, a drive that has resulted in thousands of convictions, including of former and current politicians. "
1465,"WASHINGTON — The United States and Canada are aiming to reach a deal by the end of the week that keeps the three-country North American Free Trade Agreement intact, as President Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada expressed optimism that the two countries could resolve their differences. “I think Canada very much wants to make a deal,” Mr. Trump said from the Oval Office on Wednesday, sounding far more optimistic than just days before, when he announced a deal with Mexico and threatened to leave Canada behind. “Right now we call it the U.S.-Mexico trade agreement and we’ll see whether or not Canada gets into it,” the president said. “I think it’s probably not going to be good at all if they don’t.” Mr. Trump, who has had frosty relations with Mr. Trudeau since a falling-out in June, said the two had spoken by phone. “Hey, he called me,” Mr. Trump said. “I didn’t call him.” Both countries are under pressure to find a way to keep Nafta intact and to prevent the United States from moving ahead without Canada. Republican lawmakers have warned the White House that a bilateral agreement with just Mexico would probably not pass congressional muster, and companies have said a Nafta without Canada would cause severe economic damage. On Wednesday, Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s foreign minister, who is in Washington for talks, expressed optimism that the discussions were moving in a positive direction and said Canadian and American officials were working intently to try to resolve remaining differences. "
1466,"WASHINGTON — The United States International Trade Commission on Wednesday overturned a Trump administration decision to impose tariffs on Canadian newsprint, saying that American paper producers are not harmed by newsprint imports. The unanimous decision by the five-member body eliminates tariffs that have been in effect since January, handing a win to small and medium-size newspapers, which have struggled to absorb the cost of higher newsprint and have made cuts, including layoffs, as a result. The Commerce Department imposed tariffs as high as 20 percent on newsprint from Canada after North Pacific Paper Company, a paper mill in Washington State, filed a complaint alleging that subsidies the Canadian government provides to its manufacturers put American paper companies at a disadvantage. The commission, which is an American government agency that reviews unfair trade practices, said in a statement that it “determined that a U.S. industry is not materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of imports of uncoated groundwood paper from Canada.” Details of the commission’s findings will be published by Oct. 8, the statement said. The decision will allow Canadian paper providers to stop paying tariffs that had already caused widespread damage in the struggling newspaper industry. Dozens of regional newspapers across the country have cut staff, reduced the numbers of days they printed and, in some cases, closed entirely, unable to contend with the increased costs. "
1467,"Representative Ron DeSantis, the Republican nominee for governor in Florida, drew accusations of using a racist dog whistle on Wednesday after saying in a television interview that voters should not “monkey this up” by electing his opponent, Andrew Gillum, who would be the state’s first black governor. Mr. Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, won the primary election in an upset on Tuesday night, handing a major victory to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. In the interview with Fox News on the first day of the general election campaign, Mr. DeSantis, 39, who has President Trump’s support, attacked Mr. Gillum’s candidacy by painting him as a far-left socialist. [Read more about some things to know about Mr. DeSantis] “The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda with huge tax increases and bankrupting the state,” he said. “That is not going to work. That’s not going to be good for Florida.” Terrie Rizzo, the chairwoman of the Florida Democratic Party, blasted Mr. DeSantis’s comments. “It’s disgusting that Ron DeSantis is launching his general election campaign with racist dog whistles,” she wrote on Twitter. In a statement, Stephen Lawson, a spokesman for Mr. DeSantis, rejected the idea that the candidate’s comments had a racial undertone. "
1468,"Here’s the truest conundrum of the social media age: Those who complain loudest about being silenced never ever shut up. Case in point are some tweets this week from President Trump, who wrote his umpteenth in a series of attacks on the big tech platforms. The latest sputter — that’s a digital equivalent that falls between clearing your throat of mucus and vomiting slightly in your mouth — was aimed at Google. In an angry finger-tapping burst in two parts, Mr. Trump accused Google of skewing its search results against him: “Google search results for ‘Trump News’ shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake News Media. In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative & Fair Media is shut out. Illegal? 96% results on ‘Trump News’ are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation — will be addressed!” Will. Be. Addressed. Oh my. Is that a threat? I guess it might be if you were a low-rent version of a movie gangster, obsessively searching Google News over and over again in the middle of the night. But the big tech platforms should not be even slightly afraid since the threat is an empty one. The allegation is both wildly untrue and mostly easily proved false in all kinds of ways. (For example, I doubt that Mr. Trump has ever heard of page rank, since he recently showed he also cannot work a phone so well.) Most of all, the allegation leaves out the pertinent fact that Mr. Trump himself is the most voluble politician ever to use digital media, and his entire existence has been amplified, echoed and re-echoed over and over again by the tools that Silicon Valley has let loose on the world over the past two decades. To say nothing of the widespread belief in the United States intelligence community that Russians manipulated social media in his favor. "
1469,"The Florida governor’s race is shaping up to be a ferocious showdown after Tuesday night’s primary victories by Representative Ron DeSantis, the Republican endorsed by President Trump, and Mayor Andrew Gillum of Tallahassee, a progressive Democrat endorsed by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The two hard-charging politicians, both 39, represent a rejection of centrist politics in the country’s largest swing state. On Wednesday, Mr. DeSantis drew accusations of using a racist dog whistle after saying in a Fox News interview that voters should not “monkey this up” by electing Mr. Gillum, who, if he prevails, would be Florida’s first black governor. (Read more about that incident here.) A spokesman for Mr. DeSantis denied that the candidate’s comments had a racial undertone, while a spokesman for Mr. Gillum referred to remarks by a state party official, who called the comments “disgusting.” Read more about Mr. Gillum here, and these are some things to know about Mr. DeSantis. Mr. DeSantis has been a regular on Fox News, often praising Mr. Trump. (In an article published on July 30, The Times counted at least 41 prime-time appearances by Mr. DeSantis since Inauguration Day.) After Mr. Trump praised Mr. DeSantis’s candidacy on Twitter in December, party officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, counseled against further intervening in the race. But Mr. Trump defied them, offering his “full endorsement” in June. "
1470,"To the Editor: Re “E.P.A. Offers Lifeline to the Dirtiest Coal Plants” (front page, Aug. 25): Not content at withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, the Trump administration continues its assault on efforts to combat the manifold threats of climate change. It has proposed rolling back the Obama administration’s vehicle fuel economy standards while challenging California and other states’ efforts to set more ambitious standards. Now it is proposing to allow states to relax Obama-era clean power regulations that will allow the dirtiest greenhouse gas-spewing power plants to keep active longer. All this despite the accumulating evidence that climate scientists’ predictions about the dangers of global warming are not only valid, but the impacts will also be felt sooner than conservative forecasting models had predicted. Of course, President Trump has only been following Republican Party climate denialist dogma that long preceded him. I don’t know if there is a starker example of evidence-resistant policy bordering on nihilism by a political party than this. Russ Weiss
Princeton Junction, N.J. To the Editor: When will corporate chief executives and small-business owners alike learn that global warming threatens their profits? You can’t build new houses from burned forests, or grow crops in a drought. You can’t make products in factories devastated by floods and hurricanes. You can’t move employees to work in water-filled subways, or produce goods if raw materials are no longer available, or if machines are idle because the electrical grid has failed. It is already late to try to hold back these losses, but we must try. Climate chaos is speeding toward us, not in geologic time but in our own. Stanley Burroway

1471,"[“Can you stop interrupting?” “Can you stop lying?” Here’s our coverage of the debate.] Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Cynthia Nixon will face off in their sole debate on Wednesday, a 60-minute affair at Hofstra University that will be shown on tape delay on WCBS-TV at 7 p.m. It will be the first-ever political debate for Ms. Nixon, a seasoned actress skilled at delivering her lines under bright lights. Mr. Cuomo has a deeper history with debates, dating back to 1996 when he advised Al Gore on his vice-presidential debate. It is a crucial confrontation, especially for Ms. Nixon, as it comes a little more than two weeks until the Sept. 13 Democratic primary, and she could use a jolt to upend the dynamics in a race where polls have consistently shown her trailing by a wide margin. The goal for Mr. Cuomo, according to one adviser, is to minimize the news coming out of the debate. “His strategy is to make no mistakes,” the adviser said. “A win is a tie.” The format is wide open: no opening or closing statements, with two-minute answers and one-minute rebuttals. With that, here are the questions we are asking heading into the debate: This is the most pressing question for both the Nixon and Cuomo camps, as Ms. Nixon is expected to spend the evening looking for ways to rile up Mr. Cuomo. Some past advisers have suggested the governor can be especially sensitive around the topic of his father, the former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, but tackling an obvious target like that could just has easily have Ms. Nixon stumbling into a buzz saw of a rhetorical rejoinder. "

Friedman (column, Aug. 29): The thing that really bothered me when Donald Trump made the comment during the campaign about shooting someone on Fifth Avenue and not losing voters was that it wasn’t said in jest! Mr. Trump meant it. He doesn’t know how to joke. He honestly believes that he could shoot someone and that his base would not desert him. He also believes that he can lie, and then lie differently, and then lie another way, and then finally tell the truth, and nobody minds! He believes that he can fire whomever he wants and face no consequences. He believes that he can break laws and nobody will come after him. Please, Robert Mueller. Prove him wrong. Kathryn Janus

It must be self-defense, or it never happened (just more fake news), or Facebook-Google-Twitter-Justice suppressed the real story of Mr. Trump’s bravery in facing down a nonwhite undocumented immigrant who was probably a member of a gang.

1474,"SEOUL, South Korea — For six decades, joint exercises held by the militaries of South Korea and the United States have been the most visible and celebrated display of the alliance. Each year, their Marines storm South Korean beaches together, their tanks spew orange-red flames and their warplanes run mock bombing raids on imaginary North Korean nuclear targets. Such scenes, broadcast on prime-time television, have been a frequent reminder for South Koreans of how much the country depends on the alliance for its security. Now they are dealing with a jarring new reality: an American president who does not like the drills, at least in part because they cost too much. President Trump, who in June suspended the exercises after meeting with the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, reaffirmed his misgivings on Wednesday, saying he saw “no reason at this time to be spending large amounts of money on joint U.S.-South Korea war games.” His remarks on Twitter came a day after his defense secretary, Jim Mattis, seemed to open the door to resuming the drills. Mr. Trump said that he could do so “instantly” if he chose, and that, if he did, the joint exercises would be “far bigger than ever before.” Mr. Trump has objected to the cost of the American military presence in South Korea since he was a presidential candidate. Those persistent complaints, along with his often-confusing stance on the alliance, have unsettled many South Koreans, some of whom fear that Mr. Trump could strike a deal with North Korea that would leave their security compromised.

Rosenstein’s article. To us, the photo symbolizes science, compassion and hope. The article, however, represents the opposite: ignorance, stigma and fear. As future physicians and public health professionals, we are taught to rely on evidence, not misinformed assumptions. More than 100 peer-reviewed studies tell us that safe injection sites reduce overdose deaths, decrease transmissions of infections and increase access to addiction treatment — without increasing drug-related crime or public disorder. Mr. Rosenstein fails to understand that addiction is a chronic, relapsing disease. Injection sites don’t “normalize” drug use. They bring our sickest patients out of the shadows, to receive the lifesaving care they need. Siva Sundaram

The writers are members of the Massachusetts Student Coalition on Addiction. To the Editor: Rod J. Rosenstein rightly laments the unprecedented number of drug overdose deaths in the United States. Yet, worryingly, he advocates punitive drug policies.

Clearly, efforts over many decades to eradicate illicit drug use through punitive drug policies and laws have failed. "
1476,"WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. said on Thursday that it charged a California man who threatened to kill employees of The Boston Globe after calling them the “enemy of the people” in a series of menacing phone calls. Robert D. Chain, 68, was arrested on Thursday at his home in Encino, Calif. The F.B.I. said Mr. Chain owned several firearms and had recently purchased a small-caliber rifle. According to federal documents, Mr. Chain began calling The Boston Globe immediately after the newspaper announced on Aug. 10 that it would publish a coordinated editorial response to political attacks on the media. Prosecutors said the threats were in retaliation for The Globe’s leadership in the editorial campaign. In one call to the paper’s newsroom, Mr. Chain threatened to shoot the newspaper’s employees in the head, the F.B.I. said. Three days later, in another call, Mr. Chain said: “You’re the enemy of the people.” Using profane language, he threatened to kill “every” Globe employee. Mr. Trump has embraced the phrase “enemy of the people.” Media executives have decried the expression, believing it a dangerous assault on the First Amendment, warning that it could incite acts of violence among the president’s most ardent supporters in the United States and embolden authoritarian political movements overseas. On Thursday, the president once again used the phrase. The F.B.I. said there were about 12 threatening calls made to the paper. “Why don’t you call Mueller, maybe he can help you out, buddy,” Mr. Chain said, referring to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Again using profane language, he threatened to shoot Globe employees in the head. That threat prompted The Boston Globe to contract with a private security firm, and officers with the Boston Police Department were dispatched to the newspaper’s office. A statement released by Jane Bowman, a Boston Globe spokeswoman, said, “We are grateful to the F.B.I., the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the Boston Police, and local authorities in California for the work they did in protecting the Globe while threats were coming in, for investigating the source, and for making this arrest. We couldn’t have asked for a stronger response.” She added that, “while it was unsettling for many of our staffers to be threatened in such a way, nobody — really, nobody — let it get in the way of the important work of this institution.” According to the F.B.I., Mr. Chain promised to keep harassing the paper as long as it kept “attacking the president, the duly elected president of the United States, in the continuation of your treasonous and seditious acts.” He incorrectly stated that The New York Times owned The Boston Globe. The Times sold the Boston newspaper in 2013. Authorities said that Mr. Chain faces one felony count of making threatening communications in interstate commerce. He is slated to appear in federal court in Los Angeles on Thursday and then be transferred to Boston, where he was charged. "
1477,"A dust storm overwhelmed the road to Burning Man this week. Clouds of billowing white dust obscured the caravan of cars snaking through the barren Nevada desert, according to recent news reports. Travelers parked in ditches and covered their faces with kerchiefs until the squall passed. The drive is an August ritual for more than 70,000 attendees who have descended upon Black Rock City for nearly three decades and are gathered this week to build colossal art installations and dance nude in the scorching summer heat. First came the artist hippies in the 1990s. Insanely rich tech moguls arrived on their private jets two decades later. Models and celebrities followed. Last year, politics seeped into the parade of whirligigs and hat-festooned cyclists when a group of President Trump impersonators arrived, and booths were set up for voter education. And in what may be a nod to how mainstream the counterculture jubilee has become, sculptures from the festival are on display for the first time at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington. Kevin Kelly, a media executive prominent in Silicon Valley, has been attending Burning Man since the mid-1990s. Then, he was one of the few people to bring his young daughters. Now, he said, the playa (as the main square is called) is burbling with scores of youngsters whose parents pay from $425 to $1,200 to attend. “It has become almost a cliché at this point,” Mr. Kelly said in an interview. Burning Man “is, maybe, aspirational.” "
1478,"ORLANDO, Fla. — This city has long been a leading tourist destination. Now, it is vying for another distinction: to be a pioneer in weaning itself from carbon-based energy. You can see its aspirations in the thousands of ponds all over the city that collect the runoff from Central Florida’s frequent downpours. Floating solar panels rise and fall in the water, sending power to the grid. There is also evidence along city streets, where solar panels sit atop streetlights to power them instead of using the electric grid. About 18,000 of the 25,000 in the city already have been converted to high-efficiency light-emitting diodes. Even algae pools may play a role. That’s where officials are testing a system to trap the carbon that the city emits from power plants or transportation, rather than release it into the atmosphere. Orlando, in short, is charting its own course to help curb the effects of climate change. In part, it is stepping in where the federal government has pulled back. It is among almost 300 American cities and counties that have reaffirmed the goals of the Paris climate accord since President Trump announced last year that he intended to withdraw the United States from the pact. “Cities, we’re having to take the lead,” said Chris Castro, the city’s director of sustainability. “You would have expected the federal government to be taking the lead, but the federal government seems to be backing away every day from the commitments they’ve made.” "
1479,"Since Paul Manafort was convicted last week, the president and his associates have encouraged speculation about it. Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, claims that he has agreed not to pardon anyone related to the investigation by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, until it is completed. Mr. Giuliani explained that he and the president were concerned that a pardon at this stage could be viewed as obstruction of justice. Yet other reporting suggests that Mr. Trump remains eager to move forward on a pardon and is even considering cutting the White House counsel, Don McGahn (who is opposed to it), out of the process. Whether and when he acts, it appears that Mr. Trump has already embarked on a strategy of using his pardon power to silence witnesses in the Mueller investigation. In other words, at this point, dangling the prospect of a pardon or going ahead and exercising it amounts to the same thing: obstruction of justice. The only proper course for the president and his surrogates would have been to say nothing about Mr. Manafort or a possible pardon — but that is decidedly not the path they have chosen. Mr. Trump and his lawyers have signaled to Mr. Manafort that a future pardon is very likely. This strategy offers the president several advantages and may be the most cunning way to undermine the Mueller investigation. If he pardoned Mr. Manafort now, Mr. Trump would pay a political cost. In addition, he and his lawyers have surely recognized that a pardon now could, paradoxically, help Mr. Mueller’s investigation. Right now, the special counsel can’t compel Mr. Manafort’s testimony because he has a Fifth Amendment privilege not to incriminate himself. But a pardon would free Mr. Mueller to subpoena Mr. Manafort to the grand jury to testify, because he cannot fear incriminating himself and criminal liability if he cannot be prosecuted. Previously, Mr. Trump has reportedly suggested to aides and friends that Mr. Manafort could incriminate him — indeed, there is evidence in the public record suggesting that Mr. Manafort may have played a key role in conspiring with Russians who interfered in the 2016 election. "
1480,"The good news for fans of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s Brooklyn-to-Queens streetcar project is that, speculation to the contrary, the city says it is still alive. The rest of the news is that it will cover less ground, cost more and take a lot longer to build than when it was proposed in 2016, city officials said on Wednesday. And it will require a billion dollars from a federal government that has shown reluctance to pay for urban mass-transit projects. After two years of studying routes, talking to consultants and residents, and digging test holes in the street, the city is releasing its first fleshed-out vision for the project, which would stitch together waterfront neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens that have become some of the fastest-growing parts of the city even though they are poorly served by the subway. Highlights of the revised plan include: ■ Twenty-six stops along an 11-mile route running from Gowanus in Brooklyn to Astoria, Queens. (An earlier plan to extend the streetcar southward to Sunset Park, Brooklyn, has been scrapped.) "
1481,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department lent its support on Thursday to students who are suing Harvard University over affirmative action policies that they claim discriminate against Asian-American applicants, in a case that could have far-reaching consequences in college admissions. In a so-called statement of interest, the department supported the claims of the plaintiffs, a group of Asian-Americans rejected by Harvard. They contend that Harvard has systematically discriminated against them by artificially capping the number of qualified Asian-Americans from attending the school to advance less qualified students of other races. “Harvard has failed to carry its demanding burden to show that its use of race does not inflict unlawful racial discrimination on Asian-Americans,” the Justice Department said in its filing. The filing said that Harvard “uses a vague ‘personal rating’ that harms Asian-American applicants’ chances for admission and may be infected with racial bias; engages in unlawful racial balancing; and has never seriously considered race-neutral alternatives in its more than 45 years of using race to make admissions decisions.” [Read the statement of interest.] The Justice Department has increasingly used such statements of interest to intervene in civil rights cases. Before 2006, such statements appeared only seven times in civil rights-oriented disputes, according to a recent paper by law school student Victor Zapana. From 2006 to 2011, they were drafted in at least 242, almost all by the Obama administration on issues such as videotaping police brutality and ensuring that blind people and their service dogs have access to Uber. But the Trump administration is turning the same tool against affirmative action in college admissions, a major — and highly contentious — legacy of the civil rights era, and one that white conservatives have opposed for decades. In the past few years, the anti-affirmative action cause has been joined by Asian-Americans who argue that they are being held to a higher standard, losing out on coveted slots at places like Harvard as African-Americans, Latinos and other groups get a boost.

1482,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Florida is a state so closely divided between Democratic and Republican voters that differences in turnout levels often determine election winners. In 2016, 81.2 percent of the state’s registered Republicans voted, according to Daniel A. Smith of the University of Florida. Only 74.4 percent of registered Democrats did so. If Democrats had voted at close to the same rate as Republicans, it would have been more than enough to erase Donald Trump’s 113,000-vote victory over Hillary Clinton in the state. For years, Democrats have tried to win statewide races in purple states like Florida — and red states like Georgia — by nominating moderates who could woo swing voters. But now the party is trying something different. With a push from Democratic primary voters, it has adopted a strategy that the left has long urged. The party has nominated unabashed progressives for governor in both Georgia and Florida — and will try to win by inspiring left-leaning voters whose turnout has often lagged, such as younger adults and non-whites. It’s one of the most fascinating subplots of the 2018 midterms. If Andrew Gillum, the Tallahassee mayor, can win in Florida, and Stacey Abrams, a former state legislator, can win in Georgia, it will suggest a big lesson for the 2020 presidential race: A turnout-first, persuasion-second strategy can work. That Gillum and Abrams aren’t only proud progressives but also African-American would only add to the lesson. I’ll admit to being uncertain about the wisdom of the strategy. On the plus side, those 2016 Florida turnout numbers show that Democrats do have room to bring new voters into the electorate. In the primary, Gillum won partly by increasing turnout. "
1483,"FRANKFURT — President Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on imported cars is working, sending foreign leaders from Mexico to Japan racing to the negotiating table to make deals. But their offers may not satisfy a president who has shown a willingness to embrace trade tensions in an effort to extract more from American trading partners. The European Union on Thursday made one of the most significant concessions, saying it would cut its existing penalties on automobiles to zero, provided the United States dropped its own tariffs. Although the president has called for something similar, Mr. Trump said he wanted Europe to go even further. “It’s not good enough,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg News. “Their consumer habits are to buy their cars, not to buy our cars.” If deals do not get done, the president’s combative approach to trade is risky, leaving American companies vulnerable to both tariffs in the United States and retaliatory measures by other countries. Car manufacturers like General Motors and Ford depend heavily on a global supply chain. Tariffs could raise sticker prices and cost jobs. But the cudgel, 25 percent levies on foreign-made cars, is a powerful one. Compared to the measures on steel and aluminum, they have the potential to do significant damage to a big, global industry that helps drive many economies. Mr. Trump is betting that the United States has a stronger position that will force trading partners to blink. Europe is facing a slowdown, while the American economy is surging ahead. "
1484,"“White men,” an obscure Australian academic named Charles Henry Pearson predicted in his 1893 book “National Life and Character: A Forecast,” would be “elbowed and hustled, and perhaps even thrust aside” by people they had long regarded as their inferiors — “black and yellow races.” China, in particular, would be a major threat. Pearson, prone to terrors of racial extinction while living in a settler colony in an Asian neighborhood, thought it was imperative to defend “the last part of the world, in which the higher races can live and increase freely, for the higher civilization.” His prescriptions for racial self-defense thunderously echoed around the white Anglosphere, the community of men with shared historical ties to Britain. Theodore Roosevelt, who held a complacent 19th-century faith, buttressed by racist pseudoscience, that nonwhite peoples were hopelessly inferior, reported to Pearson the “great effect” of his book among “all our men here in Washington.” In the years that followed, politicians and pundits in Britain and its settler colonies of Australia, Canada and the United States would jointly forge an identity geopolitics of the “higher races.” Today it has reached its final and most desperate phase, with existential fears about endangered white power feverishly circulating once again between the core and periphery of the greatest modern empire. “The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive,” President Trump said last year in a speech hailed by the British journalist Douglas Murray, the Canadian columnist Mark Steyn and the American editor Rich Lowry. More recently, Mr. Trump tweeted (falsely) about “large-scale killing” of white farmers in South Africa — a preoccupation, deepened by Rupert Murdoch’s media, of white supremacists around the world. To understand the rapid mainstreaming of white supremacism in English-speaking liberal democracies today, we must examine the experience of unprecedented global migration and racial mixing in the Anglosphere in the late 19th century: countries such as the United States and Australia where, as Roosevelt wrote admiringly in 1897, “democracy, with the clear instinct of race selfishness, saw the race foe, and kept out the dangerous alien.” It is in the motherlands of democracy rather than in fascist Europe that racial hierarchies first defined the modern world. It is also where a last-ditch and potentially calamitous battle to preserve them is being fought today. This “race selfishness” was sharpened in the late 19th century, as the elites of the “higher races” struggled to contain mass disaffection generated by the traumatic change of globalization: loss of jobs and livelihoods amid rapid economic growth and intensified movements of capital, goods and labor. For fearful ruling classes, political order depended on their ability to forge an alliance between, as Hannah Arendt wrote, “capital and mob,” between rich and powerful whites and those rendered superfluous by industrial capitalism. Exclusion or degradation of nonwhite peoples seemed one way of securing dignity for those marginalized by economic and technological shifts. "
1485,"The question of whether America will become a majority-minority nation — and when that might happen — is intensely disputed, of enormous political import and extraordinarily complex. Two articles that appeared in the opinion section of The Times over the past few years made the case that misleading statistical artifacts used by the Census Bureau have increased the fear of a majority-minority America, a fear that played a crucial role in the 2016 election. Both Richard Alba, of CUNY, in “The Myth of the White Minority,” and Herbert Gans, of Columbia, in “The Census and Right Wing Hysteria,” argued that questionable census classifications led to an undercount of America’s white majority. This anxiety over the decline of white hegemony, in turn, helped propel a segment of conservative voters to cast ballots for Donald Trump. Not so fast, say William Frey of Brookings, Lilliana Mason of the University of Maryland and Justin Gest of George Mason University. They argue that mixed-race Americans who identify as white are not always viewed — or accepted — as white by other Americans. As Mason put it to me in an email, “people who are racially motivated to dislike immigrants” will “not be assuaged by the argument that one day immigrants will just be white people.” But before continuing with this point, let’s turn back to Alba. Following up in the Washington Post in 2017, Alba addressed the interrelated questions of how mixed-race Americans classify themselves, how the census classifies them and how the census classification deals with the offspring of racially and ethnically mixed parents. Alba writes: In addition, according to Alba, “when individuals report having Hispanic ancestry, the Census Bureau assumes, following the O.M.B. standards, that they are only Hispanic regardless of their answers to the race question.” In other words, Hispanics who describe themselves as white are classified as minorities, not as whites. "
1486,"Eager to make you uncomfortable, “Active Measures” piles on the ire as it outlines Russian efforts to manipulate world events, particularly the 2016 American presidential election. Directed by Jack Bryan, this documentary starts by summarizing Vladimir V. Putin’s career through the time of his election as Russia’s president. In the heaps of interviews, video clips and flow charts that follow, we hear of links between Mr. Putin and Donald J. Trump; of extensive work done by Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, for Russia; and of foreign shell companies that launder funds for organized crime. Hillary Clinton and Senator John McCain, who died on Saturday, offer opinions on Mr. Putin and on evidence that Russian cyber teams work to sow conflict among American citizens. We’re told of extortion by Russia, through sex tapes and similar means, to get what it wants. And, through it all, Mr. Bryan returns to Mr. Trump, whose businesses he connects again and again to Russian money. This formidable film is sometimes zealous to a fault: The credits cite more than 200 sources of archival material, from The Washington Post to YouTube channels. It’s a lot to take in, as names and numbers zip by, yet missing some of its points may be healthy. To explore every moment is to risk overdosing on outrage. “Is This the Documentary That Can Take Down Trump?” asks the headline of a recent article on the film in Vanity Fair. The answer: probably not. Much of what’s asserted here has already been reported elsewhere. Yet if, by the end, you’re angry about what you’ve seen — and you’re likely to be — Mr. Bryan will probably be pleased. "
1487,"The current crisis between Ankara and Washington over the fate of the imprisoned American pastor Andrew Brunson is the culmination of a long-simmering dispute over the fundamental nature of the relationship between the United States and Turkey. Both sides want the relationship to continue but have irreconcilable expectations about whose terms it should continue on. Washington, after years of frustration, is seeking to enforce some ground rules for the alliance by showing President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that he will pay a price for arresting innocent Americans, buying Russian weapons and ignoring the United States’ sanctions against Iran. Ankara is seeking to challenge the “asymmetric” balance of power within the alliance, insisting that Washington can no longer dictate Turkey’s economic relations with its neighbors, ignore its strategic concerns over Kurdish fighters in Syria or expose the Turkish government’s corruption and human rights abuses. Both the United States and Turkey assume they are indispensable to the other and ultimately expect to prevail. What happens next will be a test of how much the world — and each country’s place in it — has really changed in recent years. From its origins at the beginning of the Cold War, the relationship between the United States, a global superpower, and Turkey, a developing country seeking support against the Soviet Union, was never one of equals. Yet Turkey’s alliance with Washington was never as unequal as many in Ankara now think it was. American efforts to prevent or punish Turkey’s intervention in Cyprus, for example, generated considerable anger. But Turkey still intervened and the alliance endured. Today, with the Soviet Union gone and anti-Americanism on the rise in Turkey, similar strategic differences have become more difficult to manage. Not surprisingly, both sides see themselves as the aggrieved ally. After the White House imposed tariffs on Turkey to secure Mr. Brunson’s release, the Turkish foreign minister declared that these “threats and provocation” would only “hurt the NATO alliance.” The White House subsequently stated that “a real NATO ally wouldn’t have arrested Brunson in the first place.” "
1488,"After being rebuffed in an attempt to peel back the union protections of federal workers, President Trump took aim elsewhere on Thursday: at their paychecks. Invoking authority that he and other presidents have used previously, Mr. Trump told Congress he was canceling government pay increases scheduled for next year. Congress has the power to override his decision, however, and unions representing government workers called on lawmakers to do so. In a letter to congressional leaders, Mr. Trump said the government would forgo an automatic 2.1 percent pay increase for federal workers scheduled for Jan. 1 and specified that there would be no across-the-board increase for 2019. The letter did not estimate the overall savings from canceling the raises, though it said a related move canceling raises that are based on the workers’ location would save $25 billion. “We must maintain efforts to put our nation on a fiscally sustainable course, and federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases,” the president wrote. The president proposed a pay freeze in the budget he sent to Congress in February, two months after he signed a $1.5 trillion tax cut that is expected to balloon the federal deficit. "

Russia’s president bows to pressure, fishermen tussle over scallops and James Bond’s favorite carmaker considers going public. Here’s the latest: • President Vladimir Putin of Russia makes a rare concession. The Russian leader softened a proposed overhaul to the country’s pension system after widespread criticism of his government’s plan to raise retirement ages. The plan, which would have pushed the age of retirement for women to 63 from 55, caused protests across the country and dented Mr. Putin’s popularity, worrying the Kremlin. In an attempt to ease the anger, Mr. Putin on Wednesday announced a revised plan to raise the retirement age for women only to 60, and to introduce a range of benefits for retirees. _____ "
1491,"Federal investigators have provided ample evidence that President Trump was involved in deals to pay two women to keep them from speaking publicly before the 2016 election about affairs that they said they had with him. But it turns out that Mr. Trump wanted to go even further. He and his lawyer at the time, Michael D. Cohen, devised a plan to buy up all the dirt on Mr. Trump that the National Enquirer and its parent company had collected on him, dating back to the 1980s, according to several of Mr. Trump’s associates. The existence of the plan, which was never finalized, has not been reported before. But it was strongly hinted at in a recording that Mr. Cohen’s lawyer released last month of a conversation about payoffs that Mr. Cohen had with Mr. Trump. “It’s all the stuff — all the stuff, because you never know,” Mr. Cohen said on the recording. The move by Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen indicated just how concerned they were about all the information amassed by the company, American Media, and its chairman, David Pecker, a loyal Trump ally of two decades who has cooperated with investigators. It is not clear yet whether the proposed plan to purchase all the information from American Media has attracted the interest of federal prosecutors in New York, who last week obtained a guilty plea from Mr. Cohen over a $130,000 payment to the adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, and a $150,000 payment to a Playboy model, Karen McDougal. "
1492,"For a long time, I made it a point to write about Guantánamo at least once a year. There was usually some new development to hang a column on. But the real reason was that, having chronicled the riveting legal saga sparked by the George W. Bush administration’s decision to create a legal black hole at the U.S. Navy base there in which to imprison hundreds of men captured in Pakistan and Afghanistan in the aftermath of 9/11, I felt an obligation to show that I was still watching, even if most people no longer were. But gradually, as President Barack Obama left office with his promise to close Guantánamo unfulfilled, and as President Trump blustered about opening the island prison to new arrivals, and as the military commission that is supposed to try the accused 9/11 perpetrators has yet to set a trial date after six years, there has seemed nothing to say. (Since his inauguration, President Trump has permitted the release of one Guantánamo detainee, leaving an inmate count of 40, down from 780 at its peak.) True, back in June, when Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced his retirement, there were a few comments about his important role in the Supreme Court majority that pushed back against both the White House and Congress in a series of Guantánamo decisions more than a decade ago. But those few references were quickly buried in the avalanche of speculation on what Justice Kennedy’s departure will mean for the future of gay rights and the right to abortion. I’m writing about Guantánamo now because of a little noticed order that came down earlier this month from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That’s the court on which President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, has sat for the past 12 years. The order, and the appeal that produced it, provide a bridge between past and present, between Justice Kennedy and his former law clerk who would replace him, between a battle over the rule of law now fading into history and a battle over the future of the Supreme Court that will play out when Judge Kavanaugh’s Senate confirmation hearing begins next week. The three-sentence order did not directly concern Judge Kavanaugh. He and his newest colleague on the appeals court, Gregory Katsas, “did not participate in this matter,” a footnote informs us. The court’s other nine judges did, and all agreed not to grant an unusual request to hear, as a full court (en banc in legal terminology), an appeal brought on behalf of a Guantánamo detainee named Khalid Ahmed Qassim. Such a request typically comes after a three-judge panel has heard an appeal, but Mr. Qassim’s lawyers sought to skip that step, deeming it futile. "
1493,"He didn’t snap. She didn’t whiff. The first and only debate between Cynthia Nixon and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was fierce from the opening bell, with sniping, cross-talk and clear differences on substantive policy. But it was no knockout blow for either candidate, which was perhaps more damaging to the chances of Ms. Nixon, whose campaign has trailed in the polls. Her team was banking that the exposure of a statewide broadcast debate — even on a quiet late summer Wednesday that Mr. Cuomo chose — could help ignite her insurgent challenge. She tried to lure Mr. Cuomo into a meme-able moment of “mansplaining” and while he, more than once, looked down on her preparedness for the job (“This is real life,” he said dismissively), he didn’t say anything nearly as memorable as his quip earlier this month that America “was never that great.” In the filing room, as reporters typed away on deadline, multiple members of Team Cuomo loitered to bend every available ear about the governor’s performance. At another point, Ms. Nixon’s wife, Christine Marinoni, walked through waving her arms. “She kicked ass!” she said. “Clearly won. Clearly won.” Here are some less partisan takeaways: For nearly 60 minutes, Ms. Nixon and Mr. Cuomo exchanged barbs and blows, but it would be hard to view the campaign’s only head-to-head confrontation as a crucial turning point. Did Ms. Nixon come across as a credible candidate for governor? Yes. Did Mr. Cuomo stumble irreparably? No. "
1494,"PHOENIX — Senator John McCain was remembered Thursday at a memorial service that evoked the one-time prisoner of war’s unbreakable will, the Arizona senator’s devotion to his adopted state and the maverick Republican’s willingness to break with his party to defend what he believed were his country’s founding principles. While none of the friends, family members and fellow lawmakers who paid him tribute between song and scripture invoked the name of President Trump, who was not invited, they held up the political values of the man they honored to draw an unmistakable contrast. “John understood that America was first and foremost an idea, audacious and risky, organized around not tribe but ideals,” said former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., speaking at a Baptist church here that included thousands of mourners and nearly a quarter of the Senate. Grant Woods, Mr. McCain’s first congressional chief of staff and a former Arizona attorney general, was even blunter. “He would not stand by as people try to trample the Constitution or the Bill of Rights, including the First Amendment,” said Mr. Woods, a Republican. But the hour-and-a-half service honoring Mr. McCain, who would have turned 82 Wednesday, included more tears — and far more laughter — than it did high-minded political lectures. "

1497,"Good morning on this clammy Thursday. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Cynthia Nixon — our Democratic candidates for governor — faced off last night in their first and only debate before the Sept. 13 primary election. Things got theatrical as they moved from topic to topic — from the M.T.A. and infrastructure to homelessness, health care, security and marijuana. A recap of memorable lines: 1. “He used the M.T.A. like an A.T.M.” That was Ms. Nixon saying that Mr. Cuomo used money intended for M.T.A. improvements for his own pet projects. (An example of that, according to an investigation by The New York Times, was when Mr. Cuomo’s administration forced the M.T.A. to use $5 million to bail out several struggling, state-run ski resorts.) 2. Nothingburgers. A term thrown around by both candidates as they bickered about the release (or nonrelease) of their tax returns. “Nothingburger” can be slang for something hyped that is downplayed. You can also think of it as something that appears to be delicious, or something with meat on it, but that, after you take a bite, is not all that substantial or filling. "
1498,"WASHINGTON — A mystery of the current economic recovery is why wages are stuck in neutral while economic growth revs faster. On Wednesday, the Trump administration tried to solve the puzzle by producing its own measure that shows wages are, in fact, growing. That same measure, however, showed that wage growth has slowed under President Trump, compared with the end of the Obama administration. The most recent data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics show that, adjusted for inflation, average weekly earnings for American workers grew just 0.1 percent over the last year. Those data also show that average hourly earnings, adjusted for inflation, are down 0.2 percent over the year. Both those figures rely on an inflation measure known as the Consumer Price Index. A 32-page report issued Wednesday by the White House Council of Economic Advisers contends the actual growth of inflation-adjusted workers’ compensation over the last year was at least 1 percent — and rises to 1.4 percent when including the additional money that workers are seeing in their paychecks from tax cuts. The report comes as Democrats have escalated their criticism over the sluggish pace of wage growth at a time of low unemployment and an accelerating economy. Its publication underlines the challenge that administration officials have faced in selling the benefits of the $1.5 trillion tax cut package Mr. Trump signed last year, which Republicans promised would bolster wage growth for Americans across the income spectrum. The additional compensation growth that the report finds, administration officials said, comes from using a different inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures index, which is also used by the Federal Reserve in its calculations; from including growth in nonwage benefits like health care coverage and paid leave; and from adjusting for the effect of younger and lower-paid workers entering the work force, which economists such as Mary C. Daly of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco say is dampening the growth of average wages across the economy in this recovery. "
1499,"WASHINGTON — Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court, on Wednesday dodged direct questions about whether the Constitution would allow Mr. Trump to use the powers of the presidency to thwart the Russia collusion and obstruction investigations that are swirling around his administration. Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on a grueling second day of hearings, Judge Kavanaugh refused to say whether he believes Mr. Trump, as a sitting president, could be subpoenaed by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, to testify in the sprawling inquiry. Answering questions in public for the first time since his nomination, the judge also declined to say whether Mr. Trump could escape legal jeopardy by pardoning himself or his associates. “I’m not going to answer hypothetical questions of that sort,” Judge Kavanaugh said, insisting that it would be inappropriate for a Supreme Court nominee to publicly offer views on issues that might come before the court once he is a justice. Judge Kavanaugh also declined to say he would disqualify himself from cases concerning Mr. Trump. In a hearing that began in the morning, stretched into the night, and seesawed between intense grilling by Democrats and fawning praise by Republicans, Judge Kavanaugh sought to present himself as an evenhanded arbiter of the law rather than a partisan ideologue driven by a desire to carry out a Republican policy agenda. He parried questions, without any obvious blunders, on matters ranging from abortion to gun rights to executive powers and arcane provisions of antitrust law. At least two more days of hearings remain, but absent a startling revelation, he appears headed to confirmation by the end of the month because Republicans remain largely united behind his nomination. "
1500,"WILMINGTON, Del. — Senator Tom Carper is 13 for 13 in statewide races here, a record of success that dates to his election as state treasurer in 1976. And Mr. Carper’s formula for victory has largely remained constant: stay true to a centrist brand of politics that appeals to Delaware’s mix of rural voters and suburbanites while retaining a ubiquitous presence at churches, firehouse fund-raisers and birthday parties to which he may or may not have been invited. After sweating his way through a steamy Labor Day parade in downtown Wilmington on Monday, Mr. Carper took even longer to walk back to his Town & Country minivan because he was so eager to discuss his efforts to clean up the city’s waterfront when he was governor of this lightly populated “state of neighbors.” And because he stopped to greet every passer-by, even startling one young couple with an offer to carry their groceries into their apartment. But as Mr. Carper seeks the Democratic nomination on Thursday for what would be his fourth Senate term, his well-honed strategy is being tested by Kerri Evelyn Harris, a political newcomer whose candidacy reflects the same urgent demands of other progressives in the Trump era. As with many of the generational, racial and ideological challenges rippling through her party, Ms. Harris’s bid is premised on the idea that a platform of pork-barrel projects, congeniality and constituent services is no longer sufficient to the moment. “A warm smile, a firm handshake and a witty comment isn’t doing it,” said Ms. Harris, who is biracial. “Nice isn’t getting the job done.” [Get live results here from Delaware’s primary on Thursday night.] An Air Force veteran, Ms. Harris, 38, is running to Mr. Carper’s left, arguing that his penchant for conciliation and his willingness to accommodate Delaware’s financial service and pharmaceutical industries is wildly out of step with the expectations of the restive left. She has inspiration from other insurgent women who have upended the Democratic establishment, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York and Ayanna Pressley, who jolted the Massachusetts political world on Tuesday by upsetting a 10-term incumbent in the House. Like them, Ms. Harris is carrying a populist message and a palpable impatience with the status quo. "
1501,"FORT WORTH — More than 1,000 miles from the caustic Supreme Court confirmation hearing of Brett M. Kavanaugh, a federal judge in Texas on Wednesday listened to arguments about whether to find part or all of the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, in a case that may end up before a newly right-leaning set of justices. The case has become not simply a threat to the landmark legislation. Democrats have sought to make it both a flash point in the battle over whether to confirm Judge Kavanaugh and a crucial prong in their strategy to retake control of the House and Senate in the midterm elections. It has already made some Republicans jumpy, especially those in tight re-election contests, because the Trump administration explicitly said in a legal filing in June that it agreed with the argument of Texas and 19 other Republican-controlled states that the law’s protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions are not constitutional. The administration is refusing to defend those guarantees. In that sense, although the case threatens one of the Democrats’ proudest achievements, it is also proving to be something of an election-year gift to their party. They have hammered away at the issue in millions of dollars of ads, at round tables with their constituents, and at this week’s confirmation hearings, where Judge Kavanaugh declined to answer a question from Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, about whether he would uphold those guarantees. One ad, aimed at Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, shows an imaginary news broadcast reporting that the Supreme Court has struck down the law, imperiling people with pre-existing conditions, and that the newly confirmed Justice Kavanaugh cast the deciding vote. “Susan Collins voted for Kavanaugh and now 548,000 Mainers could lose coverage,” it says. “Senator Collins: You can stop this from becoming a reality,” the ad concludes. “Vote No on Brett Kavanaugh.” "
1502,"WASHINGTON — President Trump sought to assert command of his administration on Wednesday amid reports of a “quiet resistance” among some of his own advisers who have secretly and deliberately tried to thwart from the inside what one official called his “reckless decisions.” The surreal struggle between Mr. Trump and at least some members of his own team has characterized his tenure from the beginning, but it spilled into public view this week in a way that raised questions about the president’s capacity to govern and the responsibilities and duties of the people who work for him. An Op-Ed article by an unnamed Trump administration official published by The New York Times on Wednesday claimed that “unsung heroes” on his team were “working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.” It came a day after reports about a new book, “Fear,” by Bob Woodward of The Washington Post, revealed efforts by aides to surreptitiously block the president when they believe he may be acting dangerously. [Read the Op-Ed.] The collective portrayal suggested that Mr. Trump may not be fully in charge of his own White House, surrounded by advisers who consider him so volatile and temperamental that they swipe documents from his desk in hopes of stopping him from issuing rash orders. While his rivals called such efforts heroic and patriotic, his supporters complained of a virtual coup at odds with the Constitution and the will of the people. Mr. Trump erupted in anger after reading the Op-Ed article and John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, and other aides scurried in and out of the press office trying to figure out how to respond. Advisers told Mr. Trump that this was the same as leakers who talk with the news media every day, but a hunt for the author of the offending article was quickly initiated and scrutiny focused on a half-dozen names. Aides said they assumed it was written by someone who worked in the administration but not the White House itself, although they could not be sure. Mr. Trump angrily lashed out during public events and on Twitter. He assailed what he called the “gutless editorial” by the unnamed official and he dismissed Mr. Woodward’s book as “a total piece of fiction” and “totally discredited.” He attributed the accounts to a news media that has sought to destroy his presidency. "
1503,"Asked about the constitutional right to abortion, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh talked instead about precedent. He described the Supreme Court’s two key decisions: Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that established a constitutional right to abortion, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the 1992 decision that reaffirmed the core of that right. Collectively, he said, the two decisions held that “a woman has a constitutional right to obtain an abortion before viability subject to reasonable regulation by the state up to the point where that regulation constitutes an undue burden on the woman’s right to obtain an abortion.” But that was description, not endorsement. He did suggest that the Roe decision may be a particularly secure precedent. “It’s not as if it’s just a run-of-the-mill case that was decided and never been reconsidered,” he said. “That makes Casey a precedent on precedent.” Like earlier nominees, he recited the reasons offered in the Casey decision for leaving precedents undisturbed, including whether people have relied on the decisions, whether the decisions have proved workable as a practical matter and what impact overruling them would have on public perception of the Supreme Court’s legitimacy. “People rely on the decisions of the courts, and so reliance interests are critically important to consider as a matter of precedent,” Judge Kavanaugh said. “Precedent also reinforces the impartiality and independence of the judiciary,” he said. “The people need to know in this country that the judges are independent, and that we’re not making decisions based on policy views.” "
1504,"As the Trump administration ratchets up pressure on Iran by increasing sanctions and planning, in John Bolton’s ominous words, “other things,” it may be hard to imagine that diplomacy between Tehran and Washington is still possible. It is. Moreover, it is necessary. The Middle East cannot afford yet another calamitous war, but that is the unfortunate likelihood if the two countries don’t get off their current path. The annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly later this month provides a unique and appropriate opportunity for a meeting between President Trump and President Hassan Rouhani of Iran. United Nations Secretary General António Guterres, who has cordial relations with both leaders, can and should act as interlocutor. Mr. Trump said in July that he was “certainly” willing to meet the Iranians “without preconditions.” The Rouhani government brushed off the prospect at first, but there are signals that it is possible: Mahmoud Vaezi, Mr. Rouhani’s chief of staff, recently claimed that at last year’s General Assembly, officials from the Trump administration repeatedly requested a meeting with Mr. Rouhani. By sharing this information, Mr. Vaezi triggered a debate in Iranian media over whether such a meeting is desirable. In August, Mr. Rouhani said, “If there is sincerity, Iran has always welcomed dialogue.” Last year’s General Assembly was hardly a pleasant affair between the United States and Iran. The two presidents used the annual gathering to vilify each other, with Mr. Trump describing Iran as a “rogue regime” and calling the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran an “embarrassment” and Mr. Rouhani responding by calling the American president a “rogue newcomer to international politics.” "

1506,"AUSTIN, Tex. — A federal judge on Wednesday struck down a Texas law that would have required abortion providers and other health care facilities to bury or cremate fetal remains, the latest in a series of legal setbacks for anti-abortion activists and state Republican leaders who pushed for the law. The Texas Legislature passed the law in 2017. It would have required hospitals, abortion clinics and other providers to arrange for the burial or cremation of fetal remains, regardless of a patient’s personal wishes or religious beliefs, and regardless of whether the remains were from an abortion or miscarriage. David A. Ezra, a senior judge with the Federal District Court in Austin, issued a permanent injunction that blocks enforcement of the law, which had been set to go into effect in February. Texas abortion providers had won a temporary injunction earlier; Judge Ezra issued his final ruling on Wednesday following a five-day trial in Austin in July. In some ways, the case was a sequel to Texas’ most significant courtroom battle on abortion — the three-year fight over what had been one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the country, a battle that ended in 2016 when the United States Supreme Court tossed out two of the law’s main provisions. One required clinic doctors performing abortions to obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, and the other mandated that all clinics meet the same standards as hospital-style surgical centers. The so-called fetal burial law, one of a handful debated recently in states around the country, marked the next chapter in the abortion fight in Texas — and one that could provide new fodder for the national legal fight over abortion rights if, as expected, the case makes its way through the appellate courts. “Make no mistake, these restrictions were designed to shame and stigmatize patients and health care providers,” said Amy Hagstrom Miller, the president and chief executive of Whole Woman’s Health, which operates abortion clinics in Texas and was the lead plaintiff in both the fetal-remains case as well as the case decided by the Supreme Court in 2016. “This decision reaffirms that Texan women are fully capable of making their own personal medical decisions about their families, futures and reproductive health care.” "
1507,"In a highly unusual move that reverberated inside the West Wing and across the media spectrum, The New York Times on Wednesday published an Op-Ed article by an unnamed administration official that called President Trump “erratic” and described a “quiet resistance” of cabinet members who had whispered about taking steps to remove him from office. It is exceedingly rare for The Times to grant anonymity to a writer on its Op-Ed pages, and the paper could cite only a handful of previous cases. But James Dao, the paper’s Op-Ed editor, said in an interview that the material in the essay was important enough to the public interest to merit an exception. “This was a very strongly, clearly written piece by someone who was staking out what we felt was a very principled position that deserved an airing,” Mr. Dao said. It took less than 90 minutes from the column’s publication — which prompted news channels to cut in with special reports and set off a frenzy among White House aides — for the president himself to go on live television and denounce the essay, its author and the news organization that published it. “We have somebody in what I call the failing New York Times talking about he’s part of the resistance within the Trump administration — this is what we have to deal with,” Mr. Trump said in the East Room of the White House, where reporters had gathered for a previously scheduled photo-op. Mr. Trump called the essay “gutless” and said its anonymous author was “probably here for all the wrong reasons” — evoking, perhaps inadvertently, a popular phrase from the reality television show “The Bachelor.” The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, later issued a statement deeming the Op-Ed piece “pathetic, reckless and selfish,” adding: “This coward should do the right thing and resign.” "
1508,"Iran’s rial fell to a record low on Wednesday, part of a staggering drop in the currency’s value since the United States pulled out of the nuclear deal only four months ago. Those who went to work at the start of the Iranian week on Saturday saw their money shed a quarter of its value by the time they left the office on Wednesday. Signs of the currency chaos can be seen everywhere in Tehran: Worried residents lined up outside beleaguered money changers, travel agents offered vacation prices only in hard currency, and diapers disappeared from store shelves. Many exchange shops in downtown Tehran simply turned off their electronic signs showing the current rate for the American dollar, while some Iranians who wanted hard currency sought out informal money traders on street corners. Exchange shops that remained open offered 150,000 rials to the U.S. dollar. “Everyone’s just nervous,” said Mostafa Shahriar, 40, who was seeking dollars. There was no immediate acknowledgement of the drop on state media. Iran’s economy has faced troubled times in the past, whether from the shah’s overspending on military arms in the 1970s or the Western sanctions that came after the 1979 Islamic Revolution and United States Embassy takeover. Drastic fluctuations in oil prices have also taken a toll. This time, however, feels different. The currency has crashed along with hope many felt following the 2015 nuclear deal Iran struck with world powers, including the administration of President Barack Obama. In May, despite the United Nations repeatedly acknowledging Iran had lived up to the terms of the deal, President Trump withdrew America from the accord. He said he wanted stricter terms put on Iran that included limiting its ballistic missile program, curtailing its regional influence and forever limiting its nuclear activities. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, called the American moves economic “sabotage” this past weekend, and mentioned the diaper shortage. Some 70 percent of material for disposal diapers is imported. As the rial falls, it makes purchasing the material from abroad more expensive. “Imagine that in Tehran or other major cities, baby diapers suddenly become scarce. This is happening, this is real, this is not make-believe. Baby diapers!” Ayatollah Khamenei said, according to a transcript on his official website. “This makes people angry. On the other side, the enemy wants people to be angry with the government and system. This is one of their ways.” "
1509,"WASHINGTON — An influential Chinese organization acknowledged on Wednesday that a new Davos-style forum for global business and political elites hosted by Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire media executive and former mayor of New York, will not be held in Beijing in November as planned. Mr. Bloomberg moved the forum to Singapore because of fallout from the trade war between the United States and China, people familiar with the planning for the forum told The New York Times last week. In a statement released on Wednesday, the China Center for International Economic Exchanges said the forum had been changed because of scheduling conflicts with “a number of large-scale events.” The group, which is made up of former senior Chinese government officials, including former Vice Premier Zeng Peiyan, made the announcement with Bloomberg L.P., the financial data and news company founded by Mr. Bloomberg. The two organizations said they planned to hold the second iteration of the forum in Beijing in November 2019. Yet, given the high level of tensions between the United States and China, there is a chance Chinese officials could decide later to cancel next year’s event. The trade tensions and anti-liberal attitudes that are being pushed by President Xi Jinping through the ranks of the Chinese Communist Party have led officials in China to cast greater scrutiny on foreign-led activities in the country — especially ones organized by Americans. Wednesday’s statement was the first time the Chinese group has acknowledged the forum was shelved. Planners working for Mr. Bloomberg were told in August of a move by Chinese officials to try to postpone the forum until next year, and scrambled to find another site. The Chinese group said that it would provide support for the Singapore forum, and planners in the United States are still hoping the Chinese partners will bring some prominent Chinese speakers to the event. In the shadow of the trade war begun by the Trump administration in early July, the Chinese group told Mr. Bloomberg’s organizers last month that Beijing suddenly wanted assurances that no competing events would steal the spotlight from a trade conference scheduled for Shanghai in November, people familiar with the planning had said. The forced change to the Bloomberg event was surprising, given the influential figures involved. Leaders of its advisory board include Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state and national security adviser, and Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary, both of whom occasionally meet with Chinese leaders and preach engagement with China. The planners had invited 400 prominent figures, 300 of them from outside China. The trade war has lasted much longer than Chinese officials had expected. The Trump administration is considering enacting another round of tariffs this week. "
1510,"I’ve never taken my United States citizenship for granted. It’s a gift bequeathed to me by my Guatemalan immigrant parents. My right to be an American begins with the story of their arrival in this country. And it’s a piece of paper issued by Los Angeles County, my birth certificate. There are millions of Americans like me. To the xenophobes, a Third World cloud hangs over us, children of the foreign born. Donald Trump began his rise to power by questioning the birthplace — and citizenship —  of Barack Obama, one of our number who became president. In the story Mr. Trump tells about this country, we are part of an imaginary underground army of fake citizens and fake voters, undermining the real America. Mr. Trump’s skepticism is now government policy. According to a report in The Washington Post, his administration is forcing hundreds, perhaps thousands, of lifelong American citizens of Latino descent to prove they are citizens. Some have been jailed in immigration detention centers, others stripped of their passports and stranded in foreign countries. Many of the people caught in this web are residents of South Texas who’ve applied for passports or tried to renew them. One, a 40-year-old military veteran, was forced to provide documentation to prove that the information on his birth certificate, which was of course issued when he was a newborn, was really true. The State Department told The Post that officials are targeting passport applicants “who have birth certificates filed by a midwife or other birth attendant suspected of having engaged in fraudulent activities as well as applicants who have both a U.S. and foreign birth certificate.” These applicants “are asked to provide additional documentation establishing they were born in the United States.” There’s something cruel about the government’s trying to hold you accountable for verifying an event over which you had no say — your birth. After 40 years, you’d expect the burden to be on the government to prove a fraud took place, instead of on the citizen to prove it did not. "
1511,"Federal prosecutors have issued sweeping subpoenas demanding that millions of North Carolina voter records be turned over to immigration authorities by Sept. 25. With just two months to go before the midterms, the subpoenas threatened to sow chaos in the state’s election machinery, while renewing the Trump administration’s repeatedly discredited claims of widespread voting by illegal immigrants. The unsealed grand jury subpoenas were sent to the state elections board and to 44 county elections boards in eastern North Carolina. Their existence became widely known after Marc E. Elias, a voting rights lawyer aligned with the Democratic Party, mentioned them on Twitter. Though the nature, scope and impetus of the federal investigation that generated the subpoenas remain shrouded in mystery, the move appeared to be part of an effort to find and crack down on any unauthorized voting by noncitizens. Representatives of ICE and the Justice Department officials involved declined to comment on the matter. The subpoenas were issued on Friday, a week after federal officials announced that 19 noncitizens in North Carolina had been charged with casting illegal votes in the 2016 election. Those indictments arose from an investigation by a newly created federal task force focused on document and benefits fraud in the Eastern District of North Carolina, where the 44 counties are. "
1512,"Any questions about whether Nike might quickly back away from its decision to embrace the polarizing quarterback Colin Kaepernick amid threats of a boycott and criticism from President Trump dissipated on Wednesday when the company released a two-minute advertisement narrated by him and announced plans to have it run during the N.F.L.’s first telecast of the regular season. The ad, called “Dream Crazy,” features Mr. Kaepernick and other star athletes in the Nike stable, including Serena Williams and LeBron James. It implores viewers to dream big, using the inspiring stories of those stars and of everyday weekend warriors who overcame illness or disability to triumph athletically. “Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything,” Mr. Kaepernick says over images of him watching a waving American flag projected against a building. Those words appeared in an ad that was released on Monday announcing Nike’s new partnership with Mr. Kaepernick and on a billboard of him that went up in San Francisco on Tuesday. “Nike’s ‘Dream Crazy’ campaign will air this week during sporting events such as the U.S. Open, M.L.B. and college football in addition to ‘Thursday Night Football,’ ” Josh Benedek, a Nike spokesman, said. Greg Hughes, a spokesman for NBC Sports, confirmed that Nike had purchased airtime on Thursday’s N.F.L. game. It is a shorter, 90-second version of the ad released digitally Wednesday. The league did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nike is a major partner of the N.F.L.’s, providing the uniforms for all 32 teams and the clothing worn by everybody on an N.F.L. sideline. In 2016, while playing for the San Francisco 49ers, Mr. Kaepernick began kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism and other social injustices. Other N.F.L. players, as well as a few athletes in other sports, followed his lead. His actions inflamed many who believe them to be disrespectful to the American flag and military, while drawing the support of others who believe it is a noble cause. The ad does not show Mr. Kaepernick kneeling, but rather standing and facing an American flag. "

Here’s the latest. 1. “The root of the problem is the president’s amorality.” From Opinion: In an anonymous Op-Ed essay, a senior Trump administration official says that “like-minded colleagues and I” are working to thwart President Trump’s “misguided impulses,” believing he “continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic.” President Trump wasted no time in denouncing the essay, calling it a “gutless editorial.” “We have somebody in what I call the failing New York Times talking about he’s part of the resistance within the Trump administration,” the president said. “This is what we have to deal with.” The anonymous account affirms the picture painted by the veteran journalist Bob Woodward’s new book, “Fear,” of a White House in disarray with officials actively blocking President Trump’s worst impulses. The administration hit back at the book, saying it was “nothing more than fabricated stories, many by former disgruntled employees, told to make the president look bad.” Our critic Dwight Garner said: “If this book has a single point to drive home, it is that the president of the United States is a congenital liar.” _____ "

1517,"Lake Success
By Gary Shteyngart
334 pp. Random House. $28. Can the immigrant writer, having taken as his or her subject the expatriate experience and all its attendant dislocations, ever really relinquish that subject? Bharati Mukherjee, Henry Roth and Amy Tan might say no; Vladimir Nabokov and V. S. Naipaul, yes. Gary Shteyngart is still thinking about it. Shteyngart’s fourth and latest novel, “Lake Success,” veers from its forebears by placing a Long Island-born financier at its center, rather than Russian émigrés or their children, and for the most part shuns themes of transnational displacement and the hyphenated existence. Yet the fuel and oxygen of immigrant literature — movement, exile, nostalgia, cultural disorientation — are nevertheless what fire the pistons of this trenchant and panoramic novel. Shteyngart’s subject may be America, but it’s Trump’s America: seething, atomizing, foreign and hostile even to itself. “Can it be that we’re all exiles?” Roberto Bolaño once asked, a question that goes echoing through this novel. “Is it possible that all of us are wandering strange lands?” The chief wanderer in “Lake Success” is Barry Cohen. In casting his lead, Shteyngart doesn’t pander to contemporary sympathies: Barry is a white, middle-aged hedge-fund manager “with $2.4 billion of assets under management.” He has Goldman Sachs on his résumé and lives in the same Manhattan apartment building as Rupert Murdoch. He has a congenital inability to remember the names of women, though not those of men, and unironically idolizes Hemingway. Until college (Princeton) he’d never so much as spoken to a black person, and after college — well, “his industry did not employ many African-Americans.” The closest gesture he’s made toward social welfare, aside from social- and tax-minded philanthropy, is a “plan to launch a collection of billionaire trading cards for poor kids, with all the billionaires’ financial stats, such as net worth, Forbes list ranking and liquid and paper assets on the back … so that the ‘black kids could get inspired to do better at school.’” When we meet him, he’s staggeringly drunk — from Japanese whiskey that retails for $33,000 a bottle — and bleeding from wounds bestowed upon him by his wife and his child’s nanny. He’s the anti-mensch. (Readers allergic to unlikable protagonists should approach this book armed with an EpiPen.) The writer Larry Brown employed a storytelling tactic he called “sandbagging,” loading his characters with immense heaps of trouble to see if and how they might wriggle free. This is Shteyngart’s tack with Barry. Barry’s marriage has imploded, due partly to his inability to reckon with his 3-year-old son’s autism diagnosis. The Securities and Exchange Commission is after him for dirty trading. And like many middle-aged men, rich and poor, “he didn’t really know who he was.” So, on a boozy whim, Barry undertakes that most iconic of American responses: He lights out for the territories, in this case boarding a Greyhound bus with a rollerboard suitcase containing six precious wristwatches, “the implements of his true desire.” He ditches his phone, then later his credit cards. By the time he hits Baltimore, he’s already shivering with Kerouacian ecstasy: “Barry had broken free of the surly bonds of his own life. He had been granted refuge in America.” "

Here’s what you need to know: Ayanna Pressley upset the 10-term Representative Michael Capuano in a Massachusetts primary on Tuesday, becoming the latest Democratic underdog to ride a restless political climate to victory. Much like the win of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York, Ms. Pressley’s success delivered a message to the Democratic establishment that progressive newcomers, especially women and minorities, were unwilling to wait their turn. Her campaign slogan: “Change can’t wait.” No Republican is on the November ballot to oppose Ms. Pressley, who would be the state’s first African-American woman in Congress. • In Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced that he would not seek re-election after nearly eight years in office. No clear front-runner has emerged to replace him. Senators will get their first chance to question Judge Brett Kavanaugh under oath about his record and legal opinions today.

1519,"Amid the Resistance-y funeral rites of John McCain, the president’s latest Twitter rants against his attorney general and the wild White House stories being circulated by Bob Woodward’s latest book, it’s a good time to revisit a familiar and crucial subject. To what extent is Donald Trump an extraordinarily dangerous president whose authoritarian style is constantly enabled by his advisers and his party? Or, alternatively, to what extent is he an extraordinarily weak president, constrained by his appointees and his notional allies at almost every turn? I’ve made the case for the second narrative before, arguing that Trump isn’t really in charge of his own presidency, and that the Republican Congress — or at least the Republican Senate — has constrained his behavior more than many Resisters acknowledge. A year into his administration, I ran down the list of destabilizing or immoral moves that Trump promised during his campaign and pointed out almost none had actually happened — no return to waterboarding, no exit from NATO or Nafta, a hackishly implemented travel ban that only gestured at the promised Muslim-immigration shutdown, no change to the libels laws to shutter hostile newspapers, no staffing of the cabinet or the judiciary with unqualified cronies, no practical concessions to Vladimir Putin in Russia’s near abroad, and more. In general the Trump of early 2018 looked like a Twitter authoritarian but a practical weakling, hounded by a special counsel and unable to even replace his own attorney general because Senate Republicans said he couldn’t. But the last six months have tested that argument. Trump has asserted more control over his presidency’s staffing decisions, ejected obvious establishment plants like H.R. McMaster and Gary Cohn in favor of faces he likes from cable TV. He’s pursued a version of the trade wars that he touted on the hustings; he’s disrupted summit meetings with allies and fallen prostrate before Putin; he’s conducted diplomacy with North Korea in a reality-television style; he’s attacked the Mueller investigation constantly and hired surrogates to take the attacks all the way to 11; he’s pursued a family-separation policy at the border that’s exactly the kind of cruelty that his campaign promised and that many Republicans promised to restrain. [Receive the day’s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.] So is it still fair to describe Trump as a hemmed-in weakling, a Twitter terror but otherwise constrained? My answer is still a qualified yes. The president has torn through a few of the restraints that bind him, and some of the stories that Woodward’s book tells (in which cabinet officials behave like Nixon’s cabinet in the waning days of Watergate, doing everything possible to sideline their boss) may belong more to the era of Cohn and McMaster than Larry Kudlow and John Bolton.

Carranza, embarks on his first full year at the helm of our school district — the largest in the country. “The pressure will be on him this fall to back up his rhetoric with citywide plans for change in some of the areas he has identified as problematic,” Ms. Shapiro said. Most prominently: segregation. “New York is seen as a politically liberal bastion, and in the last year in particular, the fact that New York schools are some of the most segregated in the country has complicated New York’s vision of itself as this beacon,” Ms. Shapiro said. “And Carranza, who has never lived in New York — he moved here only five months ago — has taken on the role of telling New Yorkers, ‘Because your schools are so segregated, you’re not quite as progressive as you might think you are.’” (There is talk that he will present a citywide desegregation plan in December, but specifics remain unclear.) "
1522,"Online search and Google are synonymous. About 90 percent of all searches on the web run through Google, giving the company an enormous role in directing the worldwide flow of information on the internet. Last week, President Trump accused Google of abusing that power by intentionally suppressing positive stories about his administration. Trump’s assertions were discredited by search experts and even some vocal opponents of Google, but they spoke to a growing unease about the influence that tech companies have over what we see online. As the web has grown in size and complexity, the importance of Google Search has grown. A minor tweak to its algorithm can redirect huge amounts of web traffic. Still, not many people have a good understanding of how Google delivers search results. And for good reason — Google tries to keep it a secret. Here, we’ll explain how it works, and why search experts say there is little evidence behind the president’s claims. Let’s say you want to do a search for “health benefits of kale.” When you start typing, Google’s computer systems begin sifting through its index of hundreds of billions of web pages that use that exact wording or a related phrase. (Google estimates that there are more than 53 million pages that match “health benefits of kale.”) Then, Google puts those pages in order, using a secret algorithm. There are hundreds of factors weighed by Google’s algorithm. While Google keeps most details of its search formula under wraps, it has revealed some specifics of how it works. "
1523,"SAN FRANCISCO — This is a message, and a plea, for Gov. Jerry Brown of California. Please sign the bill. This is also a message for his constituents. If you care about moving the world onto a hopeful path on climate change, Governor Brown needs to hear from you. The message he needs to hear is: For the sake of our children’s future and your own legacy as a climate champion, please sign the bill. The measure, known as Senate Bill 100, passed the California Legislature last week. It commits the state to a 100 percent clean electricity grid by 2045. Rumors are swirling in Sacramento that the governor might veto that bill. His office has not said what he will do, which is ominous. This bill could well be the most important piece of climate legislation ever passed by any government. Putting the nation’s largest state on a path to a clean electric grid would send an unmistakable signal to the rest of world that the odious Trump administration is not going to stop climate progress in the United States. It would encourage other states and countries to follow California’s lead. It is true that Hawaii already passed a 100 percent commitment, three years ago, but the California economy is 30 times larger than Hawaii’s. If the electric grid can be cleaned up in California, it can be cleaned up anywhere. Putting this measure on the books would also indicate that the world’s governments may yet muster the political courage to do what must be done to head off catastrophic climate damage: cut greenhouse emissions to zero by the middle of this century. China has been carefully watching, and sometimes emulating, California climate policy. "
1524," • Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the second day of his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, where he defended his judicial independence amid questions over how he would treat President Trump on the high court. • Senators have pressed Judge Kavanaugh on guns, abortion and regulation, as well as some tantalizing questions over purloined emails. Each senator has 30 minutes to interrogate Judge Kavanaugh. Protests continued intermittently. • For more analysis of the day, read here. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, raised two Bush-era scandals with Judge Kavanaugh, and he suggested that Bush White House emails in the Judiciary Committee’s possession may contradict testimony the nominee made more than a decade ago — if only they could be released publicly. The exchange was tantalizing but incomplete. One of the scandals was the disclosure in late 2003 and 2004 that a Republican Judiciary Committee staff member had infiltrated the Democrats’ confidential internal files about which of President George W. Bush’s judicial nominees to try to block and with what tactics. The other was the disclosure that after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Bush administration had secretly ordered the National Security Agency to intercept Americans’ phone calls and emails without obtaining the judicial warrants seemingly required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. At his appeals court confirmation hearing in 2006, Judge Kavanaugh — who had worked as an associate White House counsel in the Bush administration — told senators that he did not know anything about the infiltration of Senate Democrats’ files on judicial nomination fights or about the warrantless wiretapping program before they eventually became public. "
1525,"Before reading the article: Earlier this summer, President Trump selected Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh as his nominee to replace Justice Anthony M. Kennedy on the Supreme Court. Yesterday, Sept. 4, was the first day of Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. First, a little background on Judge Kavanaugh: Now, watch the video below about how Supreme Court confirmation hearings became partisan spectacles and consider the following questions: • Why are Americans today taking more of an interest in who serves on the United States Supreme Court? • Why have these senate hearings become such a spectacle? Now, read the article, “A New Reality for Court Confirmations: Pandemonium, Protesters and Partisanship,” and answer the following questions: 1. What was the tone of the opening day of Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing? What evidence from the article supports your response? 2. How did Democrats “make a loud show of resistance?” 3. How did Republicans respond to this demonstration? 4. What is the Democrats’ central complaint? Why do Republicans say the hearing should continue? 5. How does this confirmation compare to the one attempted for Judge Merrick B. Garland, President Barack Obama’s nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, in 2016? Why do Democrats find this discrepancy frustrating? 6. What is Senator Charles E. Grassley’s style for presiding over the hearing? Provide two pieces of evidence to support your response. 7. What is the likely outcome of the hearing and why? Finally, tell us more about what you think: • What is your reaction to the first day of hearings? Why do you feel the way you do? • Do you care who serves on the Supreme Court? Why or why not? • If so, what do you know about Judge Kavanaugh? What is your opinion of him and why? _________ Follow the latest updates on the Senate Judicial Hearing  here.

1526,"Former President Barack Obama is poised to plunge into the fray of the midterm campaign, returning to electoral politics with a frontal attack on Republican power in two states that are prime Democratic targets this fall: California and Ohio. Having largely avoided campaign activities since leaving office, Mr. Obama’s first public event of the midterm election will take place in Orange County, a traditionally conservative-leaning part of California where Republicans are at risk of losing several House seats. And Mr. Obama is expected to be joined by Democratic candidates from all seven of California’s Republican-held districts that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016. Mr. Obama intends to campaign next Thursday in Cleveland for Richard Cordray, a former bank regulator in his administration who is the Democratic nominee for Ohio governor. Republicans have held total control of the state government since the 2010 election, and Mr. Obama helped encourage Mr. Cordray, also a former state attorney general, to seek the governorship. The former president’s return to public politicking comes at a momentous point in the 2018 election season, furnishing Democrats again with one of their most formidable and popular campaigners in the closing months. While Mr. Obama has addressed several fund-raising events and issued a list of endorsements, he has otherwise confined his public appearances this year to loftier venues than the campaign trail. Katie Hill, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, said he would campaign aggressively to turn out voters in elections for the House and Senate, and also “in local, down-ballot races to build the Democratic Party’s bench.” Ms. Hill said Mr. Obama would argue to voters “that this moment in our country is too perilous for Democratic voters to sit out.” "
1527,"First, the revelations about the Trump White House in Bob Woodward’s forthcoming book are shocking. Many White House officials do not respect the president, and they’re quite happy to leak damaging anecdotes about him. For anyone who spent time in Washington during the Bush and Obama years — when both presidents were largely revered by their staffs — it’s a jarring change. But it is no longer surprising. It’s been abundantly clear for a long time that President Trump is unfit for the office — and that the people who work for him somehow manage both to disdain him and to continue protecting him at the expense of the country.  For more, read The Washington Post’s summary of the book and Jonathan Chait’s commentary about it for New York magazine. The Supreme Court. The raucous opening day of Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing wasn’t, for the most part, about him. It was about the Republican Party’s hardball, rule-changing tactics in transforming the federal courts. “Democrats are driving home that Republicans keep changing the rules,” Vox’s Tara Golshan wrote. In particular, Democrats yesterday were blasting the last-minute release — without time for scrutiny — of tens of thousands of documents related to Kavanaugh’s time as a White House aide during George W. Bush’s presidency.    “This is not the debate Republicans wanted to have,” James Wallner, a former Republican Senate staff member, tweeted yesterday morning. “Note: Kavanaugh hasn’t been debated once. It’s just the process, the documents. Democrats have framed this debate 100%.” A little history is useful here. Both parties, without question, have played a role in making the courts more partisan and overtly political. As Republicans like to emphasize, the Democrats were the ones who first rejected a nominee based strictly on ideology: Robert Bork, in 1987. In Bork’s place, President Ronald Reagan ultimately nominated the more moderate Anthony Kennedy, whose retirement in turn led to Kavanaugh’s nomination. "
1528,"The most significant political shift in decades is happening, but it’s not Trumpism or white nationalism or corruption or even on the right. It’s in black politics. Historic electoral wins, like Ayanna Pressley’s major upset in a Massachusetts House race on Tuesday, along with the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, show the might of the black political left. Ms. Pressley unseated a 10-term congressman in a campaign supported largely by minorities, immigrants and college students. And she did so without the backing of key Democrats like Representative John Lewis of Georgia and former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, both of whom endorsed her white opponent. Now Ms. Pressley is poised to become the state’s first nonwhite member of the House of Representatives. Consider too Andrew Gillum’s victory in the Democratic nomination for Florida governor on Aug. 28. Florida Democrats and liberal donors like George Soros and Tom Steyer supported him over more centrist candidates. Mr. Gillum was also heavily endorsed by young black activists across the state, particularly the Dream Defenders, who cut their teeth on protests around the killing of Trayvon Martin in 2012. And for good reason: Mr. Gillum’s platform calls for single-payer health care, abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as reforming the cash bail system and removing barriers to community re-entry after prison. Unapologetically left in his orientation, Mr. Gillum has rejected the idea that he needs centrist Democratics to win. His sights are set on young people and progressive voters. Stacey Abrams of Georgia, whose strategy is similar, has a good chance to become the state’s first black female governor. Ben Jealous, the former head of the N.A.A.C.P., is vying to become Maryland’s first black governor, winning the state’s Democratic nomination by running to the left of his opponent. "
1529,"A man upset about the fatal police shooting of a friend in 2012 repeatedly rammed a pickup truck into the building of a Dallas television station on Wednesday morning, shattering floor-to-ceiling windows during the station’s morning newscast, the police said. After slamming into the downtown Dallas building around 6 a.m., the man exited the truck and began yelling and throwing paper into the air, according to the station, KDFW-TV, a Fox affiliate. Before the police arrived, he held photos, handwritten notes and a news article about the shooting up to one of the building’s windows. “He kept yelling, ‘High treason!’” Brandon Todd, a reporter at the station, said on air. “He believed he had been clearly wronged and was trying to get some attention.” No one was hurt, the police said. The driver, who was identified as Michael Chadwick Fry, 34, was taken to a hospital for a “medical evaluation” and was later booked into the Dallas County Jail on a felony criminal mischief charge, the police said. No bond had been set as of Wednesday afternoon. Major Max Geron of the Dallas Police Department said the man had “mental issues” and was trying to bring attention to the fatal shooting, which occurred in Denton County, north of Dallas. In that October 2012 episode, a Denton County sheriff’s deputy opened fire on a car Mr. Fry was riding in after the authorities said the driver, Roberto Hernandez, tried to ram into the deputy’s cruiser. "
1530,"Looking at the 2018-19 TV schedule is like flipping the dials on a time machine. The season includes “Magnum P.I.” (whose predecessor debuted in 1980),“Murphy Brown” (1988), “Charmed” (1998), “Roswell, New Mexico” (from “Roswell,” 1999) and “The Conners,” spun off after Roseanne Barr’s self-immolation by Twitter, from the revival of “Roseanne” (1988). And this is just the new old stuff. These remakes join, to name a scant few, Netflix’s “Lost in Space” (1965); CW’s “Dynasty” (1981); and CBS’s “Hawaii Five-0” (1968), “S.W.A.T.” (1975) and “MacGyver” (1985). We’ve gotten more of “The X-Files” (1993) and “Prison Break” (2005). Still to come, new versions of “Rugrats” (1991) and “Daria” (1997) and a wrap-up movie for “Deadwood” (2004). It’s enough temporal hopscotching to fill an entire new series of “Quantum Leap.” (Which somehow has not been greenlighted yet, but give it a month or two.) I don’t generally get excited about the comeback of a show that last aired back when I ate out of a lunchbox (possibly a lunchbox for that same show). And yet my own record betrays me: For all my bias toward the new, my top 10 TV list for 2017 included two blasts from the past, Netflix’s “One Day at a Time” and “Twin Peaks: The Return” on Showtime.

1531,"Good Wednesday. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. The e-commerce giant yesterday briefly became the second U.S. company to reach a market value of $1 trillion. (Apple was the first, just over a month ago.) Not everyone is convinced that’s warranted. Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Opinion argues that the valuation rests in part on businesses like digital ads and health care that don’t exist yet. “The mirage of a much more profitable, even more sprawling and powerful Amazon may be real eventually, but it isn’t today,” she writes. Amazon’s market capitalization has risen 74 percent this year, compared with a 26 percent increase for Apple, according to data from Capital IQ. As the WSJ points out, at that rate, the iPhone maker’s days as the world’s most valuable company (at yesterday’s close, it was worth $1.1 billion) may be numbered. Morgan Stanley says that an Amazon market cap of $1.2 trillion is reasonable. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s C.E.O., is looking even higher. In an interview with Forbes, he said that for all practical purposes for Amazon “the market size is unconstrained.” More on $1 trillion: How Amazon and Apple reflect the rise of powerful megacompanies. And how Amazon’s valuation will bring it greater scrutiny. "
1532,"When Representative John Conyers Jr., who represented Detroit, resigned following accusations of sexual harassment, was there a moment when you were like “Why not me for Congress?” When there was talk about him retiring, that’s when the light bulb went off. It was not just that Trump was in office, but also the kind of injustice that I see right now in the 13th Congressional District, where we’re handing out corporate tax breaks to billionaires to build hockey stadiums downtown and everybody keeps talking about this so-called “comeback” in this city, but then my neighborhood still hasn’t gotten services it needs. And being a Muslim, being Arab, being a woman of color — the possibility of being a member of Congress, what a message that would be. You’ve said you want to be part of the movement that’s getting rid of “sellout Democrats.” What defines a “sellout Democrat”? I was talking about some of my opponents that supported corporate tax breaks for for-profit development in the 13th Congressional District that took away money from schooling, from education funding. Do I feel like they’re speaking on behalf of all of us or speaking on behalf of some? You’ve also said that you would probably not vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker if Democrats capture the House. Why not? Because I’m part of a new generation of people that are coming in. We speak differently. We work differently. We serve differently. And this is not to say that I don’t appreciate the incredible leadership of the last three or four decades by Leader Pelosi. But this is a new era. There’s a new generation of leaders that are coming up the ranks that are coming from a perspective that is so much more connected now with what’s happening on the ground. Over half the members of Congress right now are millionaires. Are they dealing with class sizes of 45? Are they dealing with the fact that they can’t seem to find good-quality public-school education in their district? "
1533,"The Rev. Al Sharpton sat at a table at the Loews Regency hotel on Park Avenue one morning last week, his shoulders hunched as he prayed with an unlikely dining companion: Michael D. Cohen. Mr. Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, had asked Mr. Sharpton to meet him for breakfast not long after he pleaded guilty in a federal court in Manhattan to an array of charges. Those included a campaign finance violation related to payments that Mr. Cohen made to women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump. “He seemed to be resolved that he was facing some time,” Mr. Sharpton said of his second meeting with Mr. Cohen in recent months. “He even asked me to pray with him, and we did at the table.” And so there they were, a Jewish ex-fixer to the Republican president seeking redemption from a Baptist preacher and Democrat at a see-and-be-seen breakfast spot on the East Side of Manhattan. But Mr. Sharpton is one of the few prominent Democrats who have offered Mr. Cohen anything verging on warmth as his life has spiraled downward. When Mr. Cohen was considering pleading guilty, some of his associates assured him that the anti-Trump cavalry would swiftly offer him support. They suggested to him that he would be embraced as an ally in the campaign to take down the president. "

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. The network late-night hosts returned to live broadcasts on Tuesday after more than two weeks away, and they dove right into the latest from Washington. Seth Meyers and James Corden both said that Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing Tuesday afternoon had left them chilled. If confirmed, Kavanaugh would become the second Supreme Court justice appointed by President Trump in under two years. After Nike announced this week that the former N.F.L. quarterback Colin Kaepernick would be featured in its new “Just Do It” ad campaign, the news drew a split reaction from the public. Some celebrated Nike for elevating Kaepernick, a leader of the N.F.L.’s kneeling protests; others were enraged — with some mounting public protests of their own. Jimmy Fallon said that seemed pretty ironic. And Trevor Noah said it just seemed dumb. In other boycott-related news, The New Yorker on Monday rescinded its invitation to Steve Bannon, the former White House adviser and Breitbart chief executive, who had been slated to headline the magazine’s festival next month. A number of celebrities had threatened to boycott the event. Noah said he was glad to see Bannon banished. "
1535,"Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the richest man in the world, has recently faced the ire of elected officials across the political spectrum, President Trump on the right and Senator Bernie Sanders on the left. Now, two months before the midterm elections, Mr. Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie Bezos, are making by far their biggest known campaign contribution to a political group that plays right down the middle. The couple are donating $10 million to the With Honor Fund, a so-called super PAC that supports military veterans running for Congress who vow to take a cross-party approach to governing. The group has endorsed 33 candidates running this year — 14 Republicans and 19 Democrats. In 2012, the Bezoses gave $2.5 million to support a successful referendum proposal that legalized same-sex marriage in Washington State. Mr. Bezos’ other federal campaign donations have largely been to political action committees tied to Amazon and Blue Origin, his space exploration company, and a few small donations to a mix of Democratic and Republican federal lawmakers. The Wall Street Journal reported the contribution early Wednesday. Amazon confirmed it but declined further comment. Even as he has become the richest person in the world — and, along the way, a target of politicians — Mr. Bezos has largely avoided taking ideological sides. Mr. Trump has attacked him on Twitter over his ownership of The Washington Post. Mr. Sanders, the liberal independent from Vermont, has criticized the wages that Amazon pays its warehouse workers. On Wednesday, Mr. Sanders helped introduce legislation — pointedly labeled the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies, or Stop BEZOS, Act — that would force Amazon and other large employers to essentially reimburse the government for the costs of some of the federal benefits that their workers collect. Amazon has said Mr. Sanders understates how much the company pays warehouse workers. Since the With Honor Fund was established last year, Mr. Bezos’ parents, Mike and Jackie Bezos, have given it about $2 million, according to campaign finance filings. Jeff Wilke, who oversees Amazon’s retail business, donated $50,000 to the group, and Tom Alberg, a venture capitalist who is a member of the Amazon board, contributed $5,000, the filings show. The group had collected about $7 million as of late August. The With Honor Fund did not respond to requests for comment. The Bezoses do not appear to have made major donations to veteran-related causes before. Their largest known donation, made this year, was $33 million to finance scholarships for undocumented immigrants who graduated from high schools in the United States. At a White House event in 2016, Mr. Bezos announced plans for Amazon to hire 25,000 veterans and military spouses by 2021, calling them “incredible leaders.” The company said in November that it employed 17,500 veterans and military spouses and was “on track to far exceed its pledge.” "
1536,"VENICE — Stephen K. Bannon may have been dropped by the New Yorker Festival, but he’s currently a headliner at another. President Trump’s former chief strategist is the subject of “American Dharma,” an unflinching portrait by the veteran documentary maker Errol Morris that had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on Wednesday. At a news conference, reporters raised concerns that by giving a platform to Mr. Bannon’s views Mr. Morris was helping to normalize them. Similar worries led The New Yorker to withdraw its invitation for Mr. Bannon to speak in October. Mr. Morris said that Mr. Bannon’s views were crucial to understanding the state of America and the world, and that investigating them was not the same as supporting them. Mr. Bannon was not an official guest of the Venice Film Festival, a spokeswoman for the event said, and he was not present at either the news conference or on the red carpet for the movie’s premiere. Variety reported that Mr. Bannon had slipped incognito into the main festival venue for the screening and watched it from the balcony, but he denied this in an email: “Didn’t see film here — saw it a couple of weeks ago — just came to do media if necessary,” he wrote. In coming months, the film will also screen at the Toronto and New York Film Festivals, where it is likely to attract more attention than it has at Venice. Here, there were many free seats at the screenings, though Wednesday’s first official showing was met with enthusiastic applause and a minutes-long standing ovation for the director. The 98-minute documentary is culled from 16 hours of interviews in which Mr. Bannon and Mr. Morris candidly discuss topics ranging from the 2016 presidential election and Mr. Bannon’s dismissal from the White House, to Mr. Bannon’s taste in movies. Mr. Bannon, a film buff and former movie producer, expresses admiration for John Ford, Orson Welles, Stanley Kubrick and even Mr. Morris himself. "
1537,"WASHINGTON — The internet’s most infamous right-wing conspiracy theorist was doing his best robot through the hallway of a staid Senate office building. “Beep beep beep beep — I am a Russian bot,” the provocateur, Alex Jones, mimed on Wednesday, his arms outstretched, his body spinning in circles. “Beep beep. I am a Russian bot in the Capitol.” Dozens of protesters roamed Capitol Hill on Wednesday to disrupt the second day of confirmation hearings for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court. But Mr. Jones was on hand to cast a shadow over a different show — a pair of marquee congressional hearings scrutinizing the influence of two of the nation’s largest technology companies, Facebook and Twitter. It was quite a performance, even for the incendiary Mr. Jones, whose website, Infowars, has peddled theories that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax, that Hillary Clinton is a demon, and that Democrats run a global child-sex ring. He tussled with the police, wandered in and out of the hearing room, thrusting a smartphone up in the air to film the proceedings. For nearly an hour, he inveighed against Democrats and mainstream news outlets that he said were slandering him, sweating through his blue oxford shirt. When Senator Marco Rubio, the pugnacious Florida Republican, stepped out of the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing to speak with reporters, Mr. Jones homed in. Mr. Rubio launched into a discussion of the risks of authoritarian governments abusing social media platforms. "
1538,"Nothing in Bob Woodward’s sober and grainy new book, “Fear: Trump in the White House,” is especially surprising. This is a White House that has leaked from Day 1. We knew things were bad. Woodward is here, like a state trooper knocking on the door at 3 a.m., to update the sorry details. Some of these details, at first glance, are amusing. Trump lamented when Twitter, the social media platform on which he dispenses Pez-sized pellets of discourtesy, raised the maximum size of an individual tweet from 140 to 280 characters because, he is quoted as saying, “I was the Ernest Hemingway of 140 characters.” Somewhere in heaven, Papa is wondering if he can’t self-destruct all over again. It is stranger still to learn that Trump orders his most popular tweets printed out, so that he can study them. What lesson has he learned? That his most effective tweets are often the most unhinged. He’s a focus group of one, thriving on the smell of his own sulfur. Reince Priebus, his former chief of staff, calls the presidential bedroom, where Trump goes to tweet, “the devil’s workshop,” and early mornings and Sunday nights, when Trump is at loose ends, “the witching hour.” Some in the White House have tried to tone down the president’s online effusions, but that idea seems to have been jettisoned in the havoc. His advisers are viewed in mostly pitiless terms by Woodward. “Trump had failed the President Lincoln test,” he writes. “He had not put a team of political rivals or competitors at the table.” Woodward vividly quotes Priebus on the chaos of the White House’s decision making. “When you put a snake and a rat and a falcon and a rabbit and a shark and a seal in a zoo without walls, things start getting nasty and bloody. That’s what happens.” "

1540,"The death last week of The Village Voice, the storied alt-weekly, was in some ways to be expected. When its latest owner, Peter D. Barbey, who bought it in 2015 to restore it to its early glory, stopped print publication almost a year ago, it seemed that it would be only a matter of time before its online presence ceased as well. The Voice didn’t appear to have a strong sense of identity anymore, in part because the New York that it covered — downtown, the underground, bohemia and its ephemera — didn’t exist anymore, neither in a physical sense nor as a state of mind. SoHo, once the stomping ground of artists and punk rockers, is a high-end shopping mall. CBGB, which The Voice covered religiously when Blondie and Television were at their apex, has been turned into a John Varvatos store and lives on as a T-shirt. The East Village is … I don’t know what it is anymore. At least Spike Lee is still in Brooklyn. The death of The Voice isn’t just about the end of a newspaper. To some of us at least, it’s about the end of New York as a cultural and political center, as the place that the world turned to for art, for music, for leadership in new and uncomfortable ideas, often perceived by the mainstream to be dangerous or weird. Fred McDarrah, the paper’s photographer for the much of its first three decades, and who remained a part of the paper until his death in 2007, liked to affectionately call it “the commie, hippie, pinko rag.” The Voice was started in 1955 by Ed Fancher, Dan Wolf and Norman Mailer as an alternative to The Villager, a weekly that covered mainly Greenwich Village. Over time, it established the alternative-weekly template: a mix of opinionated, first-person screeds; advocacy journalism; rock criticism; experimental writing; and political comic art. It introduced the short, thumb-size review, and it allowed writers like Jill Johnston, who didn’t use punctuation, to run wild. Later, The Voice Literary Supplement provided early exposure to coming stars like Jonathan Lethem, Alice Sebold and Colson Whitehead. Its art critics — including Peter Schjeldahl, John Perreault and Roberta Smith — had front-row seats to Warhol, Basquiat, Koons and Haring, and themselves became towering figures in the art world. "
1541,"Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee to replace Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, has testified to the Senate that “a good judge must be an umpire — a neutral and impartial arbiter.” He and his supporters want us to believe that he would be such an umpire on the Supreme Court. But does his record support him? The refusal of the Senate Judiciary Committee majority to share thousands of highly pertinent documents naturally raises skepticism. But there is plenty already in the public record about which Judge Kavanaugh has yet to be held accountable. Anticipating the imminent publication of Kenneth Starr’s memoir of the Clinton impeachment, I looked into Judge Kavanaugh’s files in the Office of Independent Counsel records, housed in the National Archives. What I discovered sheds light on how Mr. Kavanaugh made his way in his early career, and how he flagrantly breached his role as a neutral public servant and followed the imperatives of a political operative. Mr. Kavanaugh served under Mr. Starr as associate independent counsel between 1994 and 1997, and then again in 1998. Although not yet a judge, he was charged with investigating impartially what Attorney General Janet Reno deemed substantial accusations of misconduct arising from a failed real estate investment known as Whitewater. Judge Starr’s predecessor as independent counsel, Robert Fiske, had looked into unfounded claims that the White House counsel Vincent Foster, who committed suicide in Fort Marcy Park in 1993, had in fact been murdered as part of an alleged White House cover-up related to Whitewater. After a thorough investigation, Mr. Fiske concluded in 1994 that there was nothing to the conspiracy theories and that Mr. Foster, who suffered from depression, had indeed killed himself. Official accounts by the National Park Service in 1993 and by a Republican congressman, William Clinger, the ranking member of the House Government Affairs Committee in 1994, came to an identical conclusion, as did a bipartisan report of the Senate Banking Committee early in 1995. But shortly after the Senate report was released, Mr. Kavanaugh convinced Mr. Starr to reopen what he called a “full-fledged” investigation of the Foster matter, telling his colleagues, as justification, that “we have received allegations that Mr. Foster’s death related to President and Mrs. Clinton’s involvement” in Whitewater and other alleged scandals. Who were these unnamed, presumably reliable sources on whose word the case should be reopened? Mr. Kavanaugh’s files in the National Archives make clear that they were some of the most ludicrous hard-right conspiracy-mongers of the time. "
1542,"To the Editor: Re “Woodward’s Sprawling Exposé Depicts White House in Chaos” (front page, Sept. 5): Next week a new book about Donald Trump by the iconic journalist Bob Woodward will be out, and it promises to be a bombshell. Excerpts that have been released seem to prove once again that “truth is stranger than fiction.” Either Mr. Woodward has wildly exaggerated and fabricated many findings, or the Trump White House — and, more critically, the president himself — is highly dysfunctional. There are stories of close aides, even cabinet members, who have gone to great lengths to constrain a man whose childlike impulses and lack of intelligence they openly scorn. The White House has started to push back, saying Mr. Woodward’s book is a “con on the public” by a liberal and biased journalist. The problem for the White House is that Bob Woodward is one of our nation’s most respected reporters whose books are known for their exhaustive research and documentation. The bottom line is that our president may be uniquely and historically unfit to wield the awesome powers of his office. Many of us already believed this, but the evidence is becoming more incontrovertible over time. Ken Derow
Swarthmore, Pa. To the Editor: Not surprisingly, coverage of the new Bob Woodward book amplifies its most sensational aspects, in particular the damning judgments by Donald Trump’s inner circle that portray the president as erratic, ignorant and delusional. The question every American needs to consider is how Mr. Trump’s unmoored impulsivity has harmed our national interests both abroad and at home. Mr. Trump’s apologists default to “Trump being Trump” when our president says or tweets something that defies reality, but Mr. Trump is not some guy sitting on a bar stool nursing his drink and his grudges. In Singapore, Mr. Trump met with Kim Jong-un, after which he declared that North Korea no longer posed a nuclear threat. In his Helsinki meeting with Vladimir Putin, the farce of the wouldn’t/would “clarification” — which no one seriously believes — showed Mr. Trump’s confusion and gullible vanity at its worst. In both cases, Mr. Trump allowed his own delusions to dictate America’s position. Mr. Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress see all this and yet, with the exception of a few who are retiring, look the other way. In November, Americans have the chance to let these men and women know that we can’t afford to look the other way. Steve Horwitz

1544,"To the Editor: Re “Democrats Hurl Fierce Barrage at Court Choice” (front page, Sept. 5): Senators Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley have good reason to rush the hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, fearing that the more people know about him, the more they will oppose confirmation. This happened to Robert Bork in 1987, when public and media sentiment and senators’ own judgment turned negative as Judge Bork’s views became better known. Judge Kavanaugh has stated repeatedly that his personal views would not influence any decisions he might reach as a member of the court. Republican senators claim to believe this, but count on its being untrue. They would not support him unless they felt sure of his votes on such issues as Roe v. Wade, health care, presidential immunity from the legal process, gun control and consumer protections. Some will say that nominees for the Supreme Court are often vague about their voting intentions, routinely pledging to follow the law and precedent. However, when ambition trumps integrity — in short, when dishonesty becomes a qualification — a loss of respect for the institution seems inevitable. James W. Swinehart
New Rochelle, N.Y. To the Editor: I’d like Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be asked whether he has ever decided a case without reading the entire record, and whether he would view one night, or even two or three days, as sufficient time to give due consideration to 42,000 pages of documents. Mark Scherzer
New York To the Editor: "
1545,"WASHINGTON — Talks between the United States and Canada to salvage the North American Free Trade Agreement resumed on Wednesday, but a quick resolution seemed unlikely amid tension between President Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada. Describing the Nafta talks as “intense,” Mr. Trump accused Canada on Wednesday of “taking advantage” of the United States and said that it did not need Canada to remain in the agreement. “If it doesn’t work out, it that’s going to be fine for the country, for our country,” Mr. Trump said during remarks at the White House. “It won’t be fine for Canada.” Mr. Trudeau, for his part, said in a radio interview that Canada would insist on certain safeguards because Mr. Trump “doesn’t always follow the rules.” Tension between the two leaders has been high since the Group of 7 summit meeting this summer, when Mr. Trump accused Mr. Trudeau of being “very dishonest and weak.” On Wednesday, it was evident that a lack of trust between the officials was one factor hindering the trade talks. Mr. Trump has continued to insist on a deal that benefits American farmers and businesses and has repeatedly pointed to the trade imbalance between the two countries as evidence that Canada is “unfair” to the United States. "
1546,"BOSTON — The morning after her upset political victory, Ayanna Pressley ascended a stage in Dorchester a few blocks from the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, greeting activists who had gathered to unify the party and to see a trailblazer — black, female, Bostonian — now poised to assume the old J.F.K. congressional seat. Outside, around the corner, was Joe Moakley Park, named for the consummate South Boston Irish Democrat who had won 15 terms to Congress. A mile away stood Boston College High School, the proud Jesuit Catholic hub with more than 150 years of history and, lately, flagging application numbers. “This is a tribal and parochial place,” Ms. Pressley, 44, said Wednesday, surrounded by Boston political leaders old and new as she ruminated on the hurdles that others said would prevent her from winning. “This hasn’t always been my home.” It is now. With her 17-point win over the 10-term Democratic incumbent, Michael Capuano — long a liberal in good standing, undone anyway by his opponent’s message of activist urgency and generational change — Ms. Pressley has done more than make clear that progressive outsiders are here to stay, from Florida (Andrew Gillum) to New York (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) to New England. Here in Boston, Tuesday’s result has registered as something deeper, not only an earthquake disrupting the established political order but a jolt to the very identity of a historic American city, one that likes to call itself “the Athens of America” but is perpetually reckoning with its own reputation for provincialism, particularly on matters of race. Residents had long understood that the winds were shifting, that the city of “Honey Fitz” and Tip O’Neill and the Bulger brothers had evolved into something new. Technology and finance jobs have flooded in, enticing students from the area’s welter of colleges to stick around after graduation. African-Americans and other racial minorities, galvanized by Ms. Pressley’s message that “change can’t wait,” have made plain that they intend to demand more than a left-leaning voting record in this moment of insurgent fervor. "
1547,"Jerome Corsi, a conspiracy theorist and political commentator with connections to the former Trump adviser Roger J. Stone Jr., has been subpoenaed to testify on Friday before the grand jury in the special counsel investigation into Russia’s election interference and whether Trump associates conspired with the effort, his lawyer said on Wednesday. The lawyer, David Gray, said that he anticipates that investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, plan to ask Mr. Corsi about his discussions with Mr. Stone, who appeared to publicly predict in 2016 that WikiLeaks planned to publish material damaging to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. “He fully intends to comply with the subpoena,” Mr. Gray said, adding that the subpoena was not specific about the topic but that he and his client anticipated “it has to do with his communications with Roger Stone.” Mr. Mueller’s team appears to be zeroing in on Mr. Stone as a possible nexus between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks, which was used by Russian intelligence officers to spread information stolen from Democrats, according to an indictment by Mr. Mueller’s team. Another former associate of Mr. Stone, the New York political gadfly Randy Credico, is also expected to testify before the grand jury on Friday. Mr. Stone has maintained that he had no contact with Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, and that he learned what WikiLeaks was doing through public sources and from Mr. Credico, who had a friend in common with Mr. Assange. Mr. Corsi, who has worked with the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on his Infowars operation, has dealt with Mr. Stone on and off for years. Mr. Corsi was also one of the people whom President Trump, before he was a candidate, contacted for information about former President Barack Obama’s birth certificate in pressing the false claim that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States. Mr. Corsi’s name came up when federal agents stopped and detained a professor and author, Ted Malloch, at a Boston airport last March. Mr. Malloch told NBC at the time that, among other questions, federal investigators asked him about Mr. Stone, whom he had met a handful of times, about WikiLeaks and about Mr. Corsi, who had helped edit one of his books. In testimony before the House Intelligence Committee last year, Mr. Stone, who had predicted in a 2016 tweet that Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, would face his “time in the barrel,” said he based his tweet off research given to him by Mr. Corsi, whom he identified as an investigative journalist. He said that Mr. Corsi’s research was drawn from public information related to Mr. Podesta’s brother, the lobbyist Tony Podesta. John Podesta’s private email account was hacked in 2016 and some of the content was posted by WikiLeaks in October 2016, just as Mr. Trump was facing questions about the “Access Hollywood” tape on which he was recorded in 2005 boasting about grabbing women by their genitals.

1548,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Britain’s Labour Party makes a U-turn, Amazon joins the $1 trillion club and President Vladimir Putin of Russia goes vintage. Here’s the latest: • Britain’s Labour Party redefines itself. For months, the opposition party and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, above, have come under fire for leaving out parts of an internationally recognized definition of anti-Semitism from its code of conduct. One line in particular, which the party said would have prevented criticism of the Israeli government and its treatment of Palestinians, was most controversial. The entire crisis came close to tearing the party apart, prompting Labour to make a U-turn on Tuesday and adopt the full definition set out by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance — but with the caveat that this should not prevent criticism of the Israeli government. Separately, a report by a committee that includes the Most Rev. Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, presents a grim picture of Britain’s economy, which it says is “not working for most people.” Higher taxes on the rich, an increased minimum wage and more affordable housing are among the report’s recommendations. _____ "
1549,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, said he wanted to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons when he met with a special envoy from South Korea, the North’s official media reported on Thursday, and the two sides set Sept. 18-20 as the dates for a summit meeting between leaders of the two countries. The envoy, Chung Eui-yong, South Korea’s national security adviser, met with Mr. Kim in Pyongyang on Wednesday in hopes of breaking the deadlock in the talks between the North and the United States over dismantling the North’s nuclear weapons program. On Thursday, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said that Mr. Kim reaffirmed his commitment to denuclearize North Korea. But it fell short of clarifying whether Mr. Kim was ready to take major steps toward denuclearizing his country, such as submitting a full inventory of nuclear weapons and fissile materials, that the Trump administration has insisted on. “Noting that it is our fixed stance and his will to completely remove the danger of armed conflict and horror of war from the Korean Peninsula and turn it into the cradle of peace without nuclear weapons and free from nuclear threat, he said that the North and the South should further their efforts to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” the North Korean news agency said, referring to Mr. Kim. When Mr. Kim met with President Trump on June 12, the two leaders pledged to establish “new” relations and build “a lasting and stable peace regime” on the Korean Peninsula, while Mr. Kim agreed to “work toward complete denuclearization.” But their diplomats’ negotiations have since stalled over differences on how to carry out that vaguely worded agreement. Mr. Trump, who had repeatedly boasted that he largely resolved the North Korean nuclear crisis, abruptly canceled Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s planned visit to Pyongyang last week, citing a lack of progress in the denuclearization talks. "
1550,"LAHORE, Pakistan — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo landed in Pakistan on Wednesday for a meeting with the new prime minister, Imran Khan, saying he wanted to reset a badly strained relationship but repeating American demands that the country do more to fight militants at home and in Afghanistan. Even before Mr. Pompeo’s plane landed, Pakistani officials were calling on Mr. Khan to cancel the meeting, enraged about the cancellation of $300 million in American aid announced just days ago. The meeting will be Mr. Khan’s first with a high-level American official since he was sworn in last month. “We have worked closely with the Pakistanis in my role as C.I.A. director; our teams have been working together for a long time,” Mr. Pompeo said on his flight to Islamabad, the capital. “There are lots of challenges between our two nations, for sure, but we’re hopeful that with new leadership that we can find common ground and begin to work on some of our shared problems together.” He added that the Trump administration had “real expectations” of Pakistan. But Pakistani officials and army officers are deeply mistrustful of the United States. They say they are being made a scapegoat for the American military’s failure in Afghanistan, where after 17 years of war the Taliban control large portions of the country. “The Taliban don’t need Pakistan for safe havens, Afghanistan is a safe haven,” said Lt. Gen. Amjad Shuaib, a retired military officer who is now a defense analyst. General Shuaib said the Pakistani military did not have as much influence over the Taliban as it once did, rebutting a frequent American complaint that Pakistan should do more to bring the group to the table for peace talks. United States officials accuse Pakistan of playing a double game, using the militants to protect its interests in Afghanistan — like providing a check on India, its archrival — while benefiting from billions in aid from the United States over the years. "
1551,"WASHINGTON — Republicans accused Twitter of being biased against conservatives on Wednesday, drawing rebukes from Democrats in a congressional hearing that illustrated how partisan lines are increasingly being drawn on social media. The sparring focused on the testimony of Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, who repeatedly denied the accusations during a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Republicans grilled Mr. Dorsey, suggesting that Twitter’s algorithms suppress conservative viewpoints and discriminate against Republican voices. Representative Mike Doyle, a Democrat of Pennsylvania, accused Republicans of sounding the alarm of bias for political gain. The idea that social media services exhibit a partisan slant, Mr. Doyle said, was a “load of crap.” Yet the notion that social media companies might be intentionally choosing what political content to display was also pushed by the Trump Administration. Before the afternoon hearing, the Justice Department said Attorney General Jeff Sessions planned to hold a meeting with state attorneys general this month to examine how social media companies “may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.” While Mr. Sessions has weighed in on free speech issues in the past, the scrutiny of social media pushes his agenda into a hotly contested and political area. Democrats and media law experts immediately pushed back. “This is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction to the president’s misguided belief in such bias, which has been disproved time and again by legitimate researchers,” said Gigi Sohn, a former senior official at the Federal Communications Commission during the Obama administration. "
1552,"Here are the nuts and bolts of how our poll works. Read about the thinking behind the choices we made, and the trade-offs involved. The New York Times Upshot/Siena College Research Institute poll is a response-rate-adjusted, probability-proportionate-to-size survey of the likely electorate. Telephone numbers were selected from an L2 voter file stratified by age, region, gender, party, race and turnout in 2014. The probability of selection was inversely proportionate to telephone coverage in each strata and the probability of response, weighted by a modeled turnout score. Voters were contacted on cellular and landline telephones. Interviewers asked for the person named on the voter file, and ended the interview if the intended respondent was not available. Interviews were conducted in English, and also in Spanish in districts where at least 10 percent of registered voters were Hispanic, per L2 data. The sample is weighted to match Upshot estimates for the composition of the likely electorate by age, race, region, turnout, party, gender and education. The exact categories used for weighting may vary from poll to poll, depending on the availability of voter file data or the importance of weighting on the interaction between two weighting targets, like between region and party, or race and education. "
1553,"Read more about the methodology of how the poll was conducted. How did we decide whom to call, and where did we get their numbers? Our poll started with the voter file, a data set of nearly every registered voter in the country. We call voters off this list, which makes our poll a “registration-based sample.” Not every pollster does this. Most national polls call telephone numbers at random, using a technique called random digit dialing. In the abstract, there’s a fine debate to be had about which approach is superior. But we had no choice: It is hard or even impossible to conduct a poll of a congressional district with random digit dialing, since no lists exist of telephone numbers sorted by congressional district. Calling voters from the voter file also has advantages, because it means we know a lot about our respondents before we’ve even spoken with them. In most states, we have their age, their gender, a reliable indicator of partisanship like party registration, and a record of when they voted (though not for whom). We know where they live, so we know whether their neighborhoods voted for Hillary Clinton or Donald J. Trump. We know their names, which along with their neighborhoods can give us a good idea of their race. We can use this information in many ways — most important, to make sure our sample is representative. We know how many registered Democrats or Republicans live in the district, so we can make sure we have the right proportion of each in our poll. We can also use this data to model the likely electorate because past turnout is a pretty good predictor of future turnout. "
1554,"Go here for our latest polling results. Over the next two months, The New York Times will talk to more voters than ever before. It starts tonight, when we’ll publish the first New York Times Upshot/Siena College polls of the most competitive battlegrounds in the fight for Congress. But there’s a twist. None of these polls are finished. One hasn’t even begun. We’re doing it live. For the first time, we’ll publish our poll results and display them in real time, from start to finish, respondent by respondent. No media organization has ever tried something like this, and we hope to set a new standard of transparency. You’ll see the poll results at the same time we do. You’ll see our exact assumptions about who will turn out, where we’re calling and whether someone is picking up. You’ll see what the results might have been had we made different choices. By the time we finish on Nov. 4, two days before the election, we expect to have conducted nearly 100 live polls of the races most likely to decide control of Congress. They include those in the once reliably Republican Orange County, Calif., and the Bluegrass region of central Kentucky, two districts where we begin tonight. Besides asking which candidate they prefer, we’ll ask voters about their political views, including what they think of President Trump, the Mueller investigation and pivotal issues like immigration and taxes. But maximizing the opportunity to survey this year’s far-reaching and diverse battleground districts, we’re also asking questions that get at culture and life there, like whether voters know someone affected by the opioid crisis or whether they feel like a stranger in their own country. Night after night, we’ll give readers an engaging way to learn about candidates and districts. It will be a window into the rest of our coverage from dozens of reporters covering races across the country. "

But his record on civil rights has received relatively little attention.

The analysis is based on a review “encompassing over 300 written opinions, focusing on constitutional and statutory issues.” It is also “necessarily incomplete,” the report says, because of unreleased documents relating to Judge Kavanaugh’s time as a staff secretary and lawyer for former President George W.

1556,"Lawyers for the Uzbek man charged in the 2017 truck attack that killed eight people on a Manhattan bike path asked a judge Thursday to bar the government from seeking the death penalty, saying the decision, which ultimately rests with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, had become too politicized. The lawyers cited Mr. Trump’s emphatic tweets calling for the execution of their client, Sayfullo Saipov, and another more recent tweet that suggested political considerations should inform the Justice Department’s charging decisions. They also pointed to reports that Mr. Trump had considered firing Mr. Sessions for not following his wishes. “Mr. Sessions works for President Trump and obviously wants to keep his job,” Mr. Saipov’s federal public defenders wrote. “It defies reality, not to mention all appearances, to believe that he could make a truly independent decision as to whether Mr. Saipov should face the death penalty, knowing that a decision not to seek death would inevitably trigger a ‘tweetstorm’ of ridicule and scorn from the President and might well lead to the loss of his job.” The lawyers argued, as an alternative, that the judge, Vernon S. Broderick of Federal District Court in Manhattan, should appoint an independent prosecutor to decide if the death penalty was warranted, a decision Mr. Sessions has yet to announce. The attack was the deadliest on New York City since Sept. 11, 2001. In its aftermath, President Trump posted Twitter messages declaring, “SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY” and “Should move fast. DEATH PENALTY.” "
1557,"WASHINGTON — Three weeks from now, in New York, President Trump will find himself in the setting he most relishes: seated at the head of a polished table, calling on those seated around him, rewarding those he likes and cutting off those who displease him. It is not a revival of “The Apprentice,” or even a meeting of his cabinet. Mr. Trump will be presiding at the United Nations Security Council, a rotating role that falls to the United States this month. His star turn is prompting anxiety among people, inside and outside the administration, who worry that the president will bring reality-TV antics to the world stage. Exercising the prerogative of the chairman, Mr. Trump plans to focus on Iran and its malign activity around the Middle East. European diplomats said they fear that this will only underscore the disunity of the West, given the unpopularity of Mr. Trump’s decision to pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal. Already, the president’s choice of subject has drawn objections from Russia, which said the focus of the meeting should be entirely on the nuclear deal and Mr. Trump’s exit from it, and Iran, which accused Mr. Trump of abusing his leadership of the council to vilify a single country. The resistance is not limited to foreigners. At the State Department, the National Security Council and the American mission to the United Nations, there are privately voiced qualms about Mr. Trump leading a discussion on a complex, divisive subject with foreign leaders who were fiercely opposed to his handling of the nuclear deal. American officials are discussing whether to reframe the session on the broader region or a different theme to reduce the risk of things going awry, though it is unclear whether the president will be receptive.

1558,"WASHINGTON — It is a perfectly Washington construction — inscrutable, important-sounding, soaked in self-regard. “Senior administration official.” Could be anybody, really. Or could it? The only consensus on Thursday: It wasn’t me. According to senior administration officials moved to identify themselves. After the publication of an Op-Ed in The New York Times on Wednesday by an anonymous senior administration official — who claimed to be part of a shadow effort to protect the nation from the worst impulses of President Trump from within — a key question, aside from the still undisclosed identity of the author, emerged: What is a senior administration official? Who counts? Certainly cabinet secretaries would qualify, and top aides in the White House, like the chief of staff. But veterans of Washington recognized that the list was potentially far broader, and murkier. (The name is known to the Times editorial page department, which operates separately from the news department.) Generally, sourcing descriptions are a matter of negotiation between a journalist and a source. Both breeds have historically found reason to tack on “senior” when possible: It can help a reporter convey gravitas — who would trust an administration official of merely medium import? — and feed the ego of a government employee chafing daily at the constraints of life in the federal bureaucracy.

1560,"SAN FRANCISCO — Apple, Facebook and Google’s YouTube mostly barred Alex Jones, the right-wing provocateur and creator of the conspiracy theorist website Infowars, last month for propagating hate speech. Twitter did not. On Thursday, though, Twitter said it would permanently suspend Mr. Jones’s account, as well as the account for Infowars. The social media company said Mr. Jones had posted messages within the previous 24 hours that violated its policies, which prohibit direct threats of violence and some forms of hate speech but allow deception or misinformation. “Today, we permanently suspended @realalexjones and @infowars from Twitter and Periscope,” the company posted on its Safety account. “We took this action based on new reports of Tweets and videos posted yesterday that violate our abusive behavior policy, in addition to the accounts’ past violations.” Twitter announced its decision after weeks of will-they-won’t-they scrutiny on whether it would remove Mr. Jones and Infowars from its service. When Facebook, Apple, YouTube and others took down Mr. Jones’s content in early August, Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, said Mr. Jones’s posts had not violated the company’s policies. That prompted criticism, since Mr. Jones has regularly spread lies, including that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax. Mr. Dorsey defended Twitter’s decision at the time, saying he would not depart from the company’s policies in response to political pressure. "

1562,"CULVER CITY, Calif. — Jim Carrey was harder to locate than it seemed. Yes, the lanky guy with the dopey, chin-length bob haircut wearing a pair of hand puppets shaped like anthropomorphic sandwiches in sunglasses looked very much like the actor we know. He was filming a scene here at Sony Pictures Studios for his new Showtime series, “Kidding” — his first ongoing television role since his heyday on “In Living Color,” and his first acting work of any kind in a couple of years — which casts him as Jeff Pickles, a Mister Rogers-like children’s-TV host whose personal life is in free-fall. In this sequence, on this July morning, Mr. Carrey was trying to get a laugh out of his young co-star Cole Allen, who plays both of Pickles’s twin sons. Mr. Carrey operated one of the puppets while speaking in a goofy voice, as if his tongue were stuck to the roof of his mouth. Then he switched to a serpentine hiss, reminiscent of his manic character in “The Mask”: “Ssss-s-s-savory!” Like his best-known performances — his hit comedies like “Dumb and Dumber,” as well as later serious efforts like “The Truman Show” — this one had all the classic Carrey elements: It was antic and inventive, with an undercurrent of desperation to be liked. But beneath the buoyancy, there was a palpable melancholy, hinting at the vein of sorrow that runs throughout “Kidding.” Just as his character relies on his puppets to say the things that he cannot, Mr. Carrey is using the show as a vehicle to express urgent feelings that he can’t otherwise get across. The series is one of the darkest things Mr. Carrey has made, and he is grappling with some dark emotions right now. As viewers will learn about Jeff Pickles, he is a beloved entertainer discovering that his philosophy of kindness and tolerance may not be enough to sustain him in a world that is often tragic and downright hostile. It’s not a stretch to wonder how much of that might also apply to the man portraying him. "

In some cases, his supporters have piled on with threats to boycott the companies’ products or services. The stocks of those firms have come under pressure as investors worry that business will suffer. But a look back at months of critical presidential tweets, and their effect on stock prices, suggests that investors are shrugging off Mr. Trump’s broadsides. The stocks of targeted companies typically recover, and there is little, if any, discernible harm done to their business. Nike is the latest firm Mr. Trump has singled out. The sportswear company confirmed this week that it had entered into a new marketing deal with Colin Kaepernick, the former N.F.L. quarterback. Mr. Kaepernick made headlines in 2016 for kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racism, and has not played in the N.F.L. since the end of that season. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said on Twitter, “Just like the NFL, whose ratings have gone WAY DOWN, Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts. I wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way?” "
1564,"President Trump and the Koch brothers have made it clear that they don’t like each other. Politically speaking, they are in fundamental disagreement over trade, tariffs and immigration. Nonetheless, there is a functional Trump-Koch alliance, and the Republican Party has capitalized handsomely on it. Trump’s racially freighted, anti-immigrant rhetoric has been essential to persuading white voters to agree to Republicans’ long-sought tax and regulatory policies. These policies are inimical or irrelevant to the interests of low- and moderate-income Americans. They have been promulgated by the Trump administration, but many of them have been meticulously prepared and packaged by the Kochs’ massive political network. A 2014 Washington Post story described the Koch political empire as a “labyrinth of tax-exempt groups and limited-liability companies” designed to “mask the sources of the money.” Much of this money continues to go to voter mobilization and television ads and financing the construction and maintenance of some of the most sophisticated and detailed voter lists anywhere. The Koch network — which in many respects has eclipsed the official Republican Party — has nurtured the careers of a host of politicians from Mike Pence to Scott Walker to Mike Pompeo. Major beneficiaries of the Koch network include the Tea Party, the Cato Institute, the National Federation of Independent Business and groups specifically created to act as conservative counterweights to a panoply of liberal interest groups — for example, the 60 Plus Association and the Center to Protect Patient Rights are conservative alternatives to the AARP. The Kochs’ policy objectives that have been realized since Trump took office are legion: enactment of the $1.5 trillion tax cut; the opening of public lands to mining; the appointment of men and women with industry ties to key regulatory posts; weakened enforcement of worker safety rules; the proposed elimination or rollback of numerous environmental regulations; the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, along with the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, and the appointment of judges favored by the Kochs to all levels of the federal bench. In this context, the public disagreement between Trump and Koch over trade, tariffs and even immigration clearly diminishes in importance. "

President Trump erupted in anger on Wednesday after The Times published a stinging Opinion piece by an unidentified senior official saying that a “quiet resistance” in the administration was working to thwart the president’s “worst inclinations.” The article, which said the president’s problems were rooted in “amorality,” raised questions about his capacity to govern. Read the Op-Ed here. Mr. Trump denounced the essay, calling it “gutless,” and the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, issued a statement about its author saying, “This coward should do the right thing and resign.” Washington has been scrambling to identify the anonymous official. This morning, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denied writing the piece. • The Opinion pages of The Times are managed separately from the newsroom.

1567,"We are at a consequential juncture in the technology business and in society. A handful of tech giants have become the guardians of global speech, amplifying certain kinds of voices and limiting others according to their own bespoke, often opaque and shifting standards. Although these companies — Facebook, Google and Twitter above all — are now integral to just about every corner of our lives, they face little regulatory oversight in the United States. It was only after the last presidential election that lawmakers even began expressing interest in the companies’ power. And yet, against the scale of the issues involved, the congressional hearings held so far about the companies and their clout have often felt petty, misinformed and sharpened for political point-scoring. And President Trump’s assertion last week that Twitter, Facebook and Google are biased against conservatives only raised the stakes. So when Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, took the hot seat in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday, I worried we would spend the bulk of the time talking about conspiracy theories peddled by the provocateur Alex Jones. Surprisingly, that was not the case. Even though Mr. Jones did show up to make a spectacle in the halls of Congress, the hearings in the House and the Senate — which, in addition to Mr. Dorsey, included Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer in the Senate session — were for the most part serious and substantive. They touched on some of the deepest tech policy issues, and allowed executives to explain in depth the difficulties of managing their networks, and where and how they have failed to do so. The hearings did not devolve into what many feared — a parade of ham-handed apologies from the executives for trying to police their networks in ways that affected certain political viewpoints. Although Mr. Dorsey apologized for an algorithmic bug that resulted in the disappearance of hundreds of thousands of users from Twitter’s follower-suggestion box this year, neither he nor Ms. Sandberg was prepared to genuflect toward cheap claims of bias. A cynic might point out that the hearings arrived at few solutions to the thorny problems they raised. Yet in highlighting the complexities of their systems, Mr. Dorsey’s and Ms. Sandberg’s testimony helped underscore the difficulties lawmakers will face in figuring out ways to ensure that tech companies are guarding people’s political freedoms and privacy while protecting their services from those who would spread misinformation and propaganda. "
1568,"RE: WHEN THE SUPREME COURT LURCHES RIGHT Emily Bazelon wrote about what can happen when the Supreme Court becomes significantly more conservative than the public. Contrary to Emily Bazelon’s assumption, the law reflects political power, not intellectual tidiness or grand interpretive theories. Justice Benjamin Cardozo echoed this elegantly in “The Nature of the Judicial Process”: “The great tides and currents which engulf the rest of men do not turn aside in their course and pass the judges by.” At best, the United States Supreme Court is a speed bump in the road traveled by dominant political forces. The fault will not lie with the court but with ourselves if the nation continues to fragment and decay. Bruce Fein, associate deputy attorney general under Ronald Reagan Emily Bazelon gives us her Slate slant, as I call it, on the Supreme Court. She describes the possibility of a five-member “conservative bloc, all Republican appointees, facing off against four liberal-moderates chosen by Democratic presidents.” Apparently, adding the word “moderate” can euphemistically soften the left-wing tendencies of Ginsburg, Kagan, Sotomayor and Breyer. Regarding Roe v. Wade, it’s ironic that the decision in 1973 was also a 7-2 vote and just as unpopular as Dred Scott in 1857, and still is to millions of Americans. Bazelon engages in wishful thinking when she conjures “a new dominant national alliance” emerging “to the left of the Roberts Court.” As a NeverTrump Republican turned independent, I will be grateful for a possible shift to conservative values in a refigured Supreme Court. It’s about time. Mary Curtius, Reno "

This year alone we’ve seen the release of White House tell-alls from the writer Michael Wolff, the fired Trump aide Omarosa Manigault Newman and now the famed journalist Bob Woodward — whose new book, “Fear,” includes humiliating accounts of President Trump’s frayed leadership. The book drew a defensive rebuke from the president on Wednesday. Trevor Noah said this is all big news — but nearly two years into Trump’s presidency, it’s hard for anything to surprise him. After showing a clip of an NBC reporter calling the Woodward book a “bombshell,” Noah said it felt more like the norm. Another sort-of-bombshell: On Wednesday, The New York Times published an anonymous Op-Ed article by a senior Trump administration official who wrote that people in the president’s own administration are devoted to undermining him and “thwarting Mr. Trump’s more misguided impulses.” Jaded though he is, Noah said he was disturbed by some parts of the Op-Ed. In one passage, the writer contends that members of the administration considered using the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office, but decided against it to avoid “a constitutional crisis.” The article’s author sought to reassure readers by saying, “Americans should know that there are adults in the room,” but Noah was not convinced. Jimmy Fallon started “The Tonight Show” on Wednesday dressed up as Trump, addressing the Woodward book from behind the president’s desk in the Oval Office. "

1571,"SEOUL, South Korea — Offering an olive branch to President Trump, Kim Jong-un told a South Korean envoy that he wanted to denuclearize North Korea before Mr. Trump’s current term ends in early 2021, the envoy said on Thursday. Expressing frustration over what he called Washington’s failure to negotiate in good faith, Mr. Kim told the envoy, Chung Eui-yong, that he still had confidence in Mr. Trump. He said he had never spoken badly of the American leader, even to his closest aides, since the two met in Singapore on June 12, according to Mr. Chung. The president responded on Twitter early Thursday, expressing appreciation for Mr. Kim’s “unwavering faith in President Trump.” He added, “We will get it done together!” Mr. Chung was sent by President Moon Jae-in of South Korea to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on Wednesday in hopes of reviving the stalled talks between the North and the United States over how to denuclearize North Korea. Mr. Moon plans to go to Pyongyang on Sept. 18 to meet with Mr. Kim and discuss improving the Koreas’ relationship, including potential economic cooperation. At a televised news conference in Seoul, Mr. Chung said Mr. Kim had voiced frustration that his commitment to nuclear disarmament, which he expressed when he met with Mr. Moon in April and with Mr. Trump in June, was not taken seriously by much of the world. Mr. Kim said that while North Korea had already taken important steps toward denuclearization, Washington was not doing enough in return, Mr. Chung said. "

1573,"SYDNEY, Australia — When a suicidal 10-year-old boy in an offshore detention camp asked to come to Australia for psychiatric care, Peter Dutton’s answer was no. When an Australian combat veteran requested a refugee visa for his Afghan interpreter, Mr. Dutton — Australia’s top immigration official — also refused. But when an Italian au pair, who worked for a former colleague, needed a reprieve from deportation, Mr. Dutton obliged. It was at least the second European au pair for whom he made an exception in 2015, calling the visa a “humanitarian act.” Critics across Australia are calling it something else: hypocrisy that reveals an unjust immigration system. “I’m totally disgusted that the minister has used his powers to intervene in those cases,” said Jason Scanes, 41, a former army captain who has campaigned unsuccessfully for years to get a visa for his Afghan interpreter. “I’m just asking for a fair process and a fair go.” Australia has always struggled with who belongs. The first British settlers slaughtered the indigenous population, and xenophobia has shaped the nation since its earliest days when the government restricted migration to whites. In some ways, Mr. Dutton, 47, a former police officer who has been in Parliament since 2001, is simply the latest in a long line of Australian leaders to seize on concerns about foreigners and security to advance their political careers.

1574,"STOCKHOLM — To understand why Sweden, a bastion of social democracy, might end up with a far-right party in government after national elections on Sunday, you need to take a walk with Ahmed Abdirahman. An American-educated Somali immigrant who works as a policy analyst at the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Abdirahman grew up and now lives in the suburb of Rinkeby-Tensta, where some 90 percent of residents have a foreign background, roughly 80 percent live on welfare or earn low incomes and 42 percent are under age 25. It is a violent place: Sixteen people were killed there in 2016, mostly in drug-related conflicts, an unheard-of number in this typically peaceful country. As we walk along one of its main streets at 7 p.m., shopkeepers pull down the metal shutters in front of their windows, while young masked men on scooters start speeding through the streets. A police helicopter hovers overhead. The segregation and violence of Rinkeby-Tensta, and the likelihood that the far-right, anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats party will win the most votes in this weekend’s national elections, are both the result of the country’s long-running unwillingness to deal with the realities of its immigration crisis. For decades, Sweden, once a racially and culturally homogeneous country with an expansive social welfare system, insisted that it could absorb large numbers of non-European migrants without considering how those migrants should be integrated into Swedish society. As they did in cities across Western Europe, migrants tended to cluster in low-income neighborhoods; facing poor job prospects and rampant employment discrimination, they naturally turned inward. More young women have started wearing the hijab recently, Mr. Abdirahman tells me, and more young men “internalize the otherness” — rejected by their new society, they embrace the stereotypes imposed upon them. This can lead to a point where they reject gay rights or liberalism as “white, Western ideas,” and even attack firefighters because they represent the state. As we walk around, Mr. Abdirahman, who is single and childless, confesses: “When I came here in 1998, to me this place was paradise. Today, I wouldn’t want my children to grow up here.” "
1575,"Sarah Silverman’s variety show returns to Hulu. And the N.F.L. season kicks off. I LOVE YOU, AMERICA on Hulu. The first season of the comedian Sarah Silverman’s variety show featured a wide variety of guests, including Christian Picciolini, a white supremacist turned anti-hate advocate, and Susan Silverman, a rabbi and a sister of the host. What became a defining feature of Ms. Silverman’s show has been her ability to simply listen: In the 10-episode season, she spoke with people across the political spectrum, and Ms. Silverman’s approach to these conversations was far less confrontational than that of other hosts, like Samantha Bee or John Oliver. “You’ve never changed someone’s mind by arguing,” Ms. Silverman told The New York Times last year. Expect that conviction to carry into the second season, which begins on Thursday. JERRY SPRINGER: THE OPERA on BroadwayHD. Speaking in Ohio at a political event on Monday, Jerry Springer offered his thoughts on President Trump, saying, “He took my show and brought it to the White House.” Ben Brantley, in his review in The Times of a recent Off Broadway production of this bawdy musical, wrote that Mr. Springer’s TV show was “a confessional forum for dysfunctional and dispossessed Americans,” adding that the musical “may be the richest theatrical means we have for channeling the heaving American id that put Mr. Trump in the White House.” It begins as a fictionalized, opera-infused spoof of “The Jerry Springer Show” before descending into a hellish frenzy.

1577,"Nearly two million low-income Americans, including 469,000 households with young children, would be stripped of benefits under the House version of the farm bill being considered this week by congressional negotiators, according to an analysis by a nonpartisan research firm. The bill, a multiyear spending measure that narrowly passed the House in June, includes a proposal to reformulate income and expense criteria for the 42 million recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Under the bill, states could remove about 8 percent of those receiving aid from the rolls, according to the research firm, Mathematica, which used data from the Agriculture Department’s Food and Nutrition Service. About 34 percent of seniors in the program, or 677,000 households, would lose benefits under the proposal, according to the study. More than one in 10 people with a disability, another 214,000 households, would also lose eligibility. Those estimates do not account for another proposal in the measure, which would impose strict new work requirements on beneficiaries. An additional 1.2 million people could be stripped of aid under that plan, according to a separate analysis released in May by the Congressional Budget Office, the study’s authors said. By contrast, the Senate’s version of the farm bill, which had bipartisan support, did not include tougher work requirements or the new benefit formula, and negotiators are struggling to reconcile such differences. "
1578,"LONDON — There have been exhibitions of protest art and satire, but the British Museum’s “I object,” running through Jan. 20, tells the history of political anger somewhat differently — by tracing the history of dissent right back, not just to the ’60s, or the French Revolution, but to the ancient Egyptians. “I wanted the exhibition to be as broad as possible,” Ian Hislop, its curator, said while touring it recently. “I wanted to be able to include every gesture from writing your own name over the king’s on a Babylonian brick, to an intricate Chinese silk screen. I didn’t want to restrict it to placards and badges.” Mr. Hislop’s curation is a coup for the museum. In Britain, his name is almost a byword for giving the finger to authority. For more than 30 years he’s been editor of Private Eye, Britain’s most prominent satirical magazine, which sells more than 230,000 copies each issue. But delving into the British Museum’s collections taught even him a few things about protest. “I always assumed that in ancient civilizations there wasn’t any — you dissent, you die,” Mr. Hislop said. “Actually that wasn’t true at all.” Well, he added, people did die, but only if they got caught. Touring the exhibition, Mr. Hislop and Tom Hockenhull, a curator at the British Museum who collaborated with Mr. Hislop on the show — offered insight into some of their favorite items, including the fake ancient rock that the artist Banksy once hung in the museum. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. "
1579,"At a fundamental level, the attempt to jam Brett Kavanaugh onto the Supreme Court closely resembles the way Republicans passed a tax cut last year. Once again we see a rushed, nakedly partisan process, with G.O.P. leaders withholding much of the information that’s supposed to go into congressional deliberations. Once again the outcome is all too likely to rest on pure tribalism: Unless some Republicans develop a very late case of conscience, they will vote along party lines with the full knowledge that they’re abdicating their constitutional duty to provide advice and consent. True, Kavanaugh is at least getting a hearing, which the tax bill never did. But he’s bobbing and weaving his way through, refusing to answer even straightforward questions, displaying an evasiveness utterly at odds with the probity we used to expect of Supreme Court justices. No, the real difference from the tax bill story is that last year we were talking only about a couple of trillion dollars. This year we’re talking about the future of the Republic. For a Kavanaugh confirmation will set us up for multiple constitutional crises. After all, if Kavanaugh is confirmed, we will be trying to navigate a turbulent era in American politics with a Supreme Court in which two seats were effectively stolen. First Republicans refused even to give President Barack Obama’s nominee so much as a hearing; then they will have filled two positions with nominees chosen by a president who lost the popular vote and eked out an Electoral College win only with aid from a hostile foreign power. [Receive the day’s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.] Would a Justice Kavanaugh conduct himself with the caution appropriate to such a fraught situation? Well, miracles of personal redemption do happen. But it’s very unlikely. On the contrary, every indication is that if he makes it, he and his fellow justices will abuse their power at every level. "
1580,"Commentary on Supreme Court nominations these days is more akin to sportscasters announcing a close baseball game: “The liberals and conservatives are tied going into the bottom of the ninth. Brett Kavanaugh, a promising rookie pitcher with a strong minor league record, is coming in to replace the streaky Anthony Kennedy. When Kennedy was hot, the conservatives won, but when he slumped, the liberals could squeeze by. Kavanaugh seems a lot steadier than Kennedy.” This way of handicapping Supreme Court nominees has a definite allure. We all love a horse race, and politics often seems like one. But for court nominations, sports analogies are dangerously misleading. It is true that knowing the party of the president and the nominee provides a strong indication of how the nominee will later vote in cases of sharp partisan differences on the underlying policy issue — for example, the recent Janus v. Afscme decision barring a union from imposing agency fees on nonmembers. But in 75 percent of cases, partisan affiliation is not fully predictive of justices’ votes. In the hardest ones, lower courts reached different results despite seeing the same evidence, and considering the same legal arguments. This week, senators should spend less time grandstanding with questions that simply highlight Judge Kavanaugh’s well-known ideological positions, and a lot more time trying to assess how he would vote in these much trickier cases. What accounts for these “circuit splits”? In hard cases, excellent legal arguments (not just ideological ones) can be made on both sides, often because the relevant legal principles are unclear or conflicting. Also, judges (and administrative agencies initially) can reasonably interpret the key facts differently. The competing values (there may be more than two) may be compelling. Most justices care about a decision’s legal and social consequences, yet in hard cases these effects may be opaque and unpredictable — perhaps because they depend on what the states decide to do. In some hard cases — Brown v. Board of Education or same-sex marriage, for example — the legal and social landscape may have shifted so much that even conservative justices, who normally resist “living Constitution” arguments, may take these changes into account. In clashes between national security and individual rights claims (e.g., the recent travel ban decision), even liberal justices may defer to the government’s judgment. And it is hard to predict how courts will apply the multiple criteria — what Judge Kavanaugh referred to in his testimony this week as “precedents on precedents” — for deciding when precedents may be overturned. This is why even some conservative justices may resist overturning Roe v. Wade. (They may try to eviscerate it in other ways, of course.) And, of course, even on the Supreme Court, politics has a way of trumping ideology in unpredictable ways. Who would have expected that Chief Justice John Roberts would seek out a way to rescue the Affordable Care Act in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius? "

Attorney General Jeff Sessions revealed plans to investigate social media companies over potential censorship of political views. According to the WSJ, the Justice Department is to hold a meeting on Sept. 25 with state attorneys general “to discuss a growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.” Bonus: More Americans are taking breaks from Facebook.

The NFL in Dangerous Times
By Mark Leibovich
Illustrated. 373 pp. Penguin Press. $28. When the Hall of Fame running back Earl Campbell retired in 1986 following eight seasons of highlight-reel collisions, defenders throughout the National Football League breathed a respectful sigh of relief. No one dished out more punishment than Campbell or did less to avoid it. “Every time you hit him,” a linebacker said, “you lower your own I.Q.” Campbell uses a metal walker today — not surprising for someone who’s had both knees replaced, endured multiple back surgeries and been treated for substance abuse. “I think if I’d gotten a real physical like they do now, CAT scans and everything,” he admits, “probably I wouldn’t have been able to play.” That thought rankles Campbell, who views his battered frame as a proud reminder of a game unblemished by silly rules and complaints. “I can’t play because I’ve got a hangnail. … I don’t play because my head hurt,” he says, mocking the current combatants. “That wouldn’t have got the job done back in my day.” Of course, pro football remains a dangerous game. The average career is 3.3 years and shrinking, as more players retire early because of injury or fear of lasting damage. Still, Campbell’s words reflect a growing sense of unease about the league. Too violent, too soft, too nationalistic, too unpatriotic — is pro football in trouble? There was a day, writes The New York Times Magazine’s chief national correspondent, Mark Leibovich, in “Big Game,” a gossipy, insightful and wickedly entertaining journey through the N.F.L. sausage factory, when the league could make sticky problems disappear. Not anymore. Since 2014, when his story begins, pro football has been shredded by scandal, from the video gone viral of the running back Ray Rice knocking his fiancée senseless to the murder conviction and suicide of the tight end Aaron Hernandez, whose multiple concussions produced “the most severe case” of chronic traumatic encephalopathy that medical experts had ever seen in someone so young. Meantime, the N.F.L.’s marquee player was suspended for (allegedly) deflating footballs, while a second-string quarterback ignited a firestorm by kneeling in protest during the national anthem. Who’s minding this mess? Leibovich starts at the top. An effective N.F.L. commissioner must be adept at two things, he contends. First, manage the needs of the billionaire team owners, which the current commissioner, Roger Goodell, does quite nicely. Second, protect the league from serious scandals and lesser embarrassments, which he seems unable to master. The gaffe-prone Goodell calls to mind the words supposedly uttered by Winston Churchill about Secretary of State John Foster Dulles: “A bull who carries his china shop along with him.” Two years ago, with the concussion issue now a national story, Goodell, the father of twin girls, was asked whether he would allow a son to play football. Yes, he replied, “because of the values” one gets from the game. A fine answer, until he added: “There is risk in life. There is risk in sitting on the couch.” These words don’t quite rise to the musings of the Dallas Cowboys owner, Jerry Jones, who compared the concussion flap to “a pimple on a baby’s ass,” but they did arouse considerable suspicion about the league’s intentions. Moreover, Leibovich says, they speak to a problem that continues to dog the unscripted Goodell, as when he credited the players for getting arrested less frequently in 2015 than in previous years. Who would even think to touch the subject, much less praise those lucky enough to avoid jail? "
1584,"TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — Among the many revelations in Bob Woodward’s new book “Fear: Trump in the White House,” it seems the president does not think much of Southern lawyers (in general) or graduates of the University of Alabama School of Law (in particular). He is mistaken on both counts. Mr. Woodward claims that President Trump has called Jeff Sessions, his attorney general, “a dumb Southerner” and an “idiot,” used an inappropriate epithet that targets people with developmental disabilities and parodied his Southern accent to aides. The president is said to have asked Rob Porter, his staff secretary at the time: “How in the world was I ever persuaded to pick him for my attorney general? He couldn’t even be a one-person country lawyer down in Alabama. What business does he have being attorney general?” Politico reports that President Trump wishes that Mr. Sessions had gone to a law school like Harvard or Yale, rather than Alabama, “griping to aides and lawmakers that the attorney general doesn’t have the Ivy League pedigree the president prefers.” Mr. Trump’s contempt for non-Ivy-educated lawyers is all the more striking, given that he has surrounded himself with them. His own lawyer, Jay Sekulow, took his law degree from Mercer University, in Macon, Ga. Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer for many years and tasked with more than a few important lawyerly duties, is a graduate of the Western Michigan University Thomas M. Cooley Law School, in Lansing, while another personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, went to New York University for law school. The president’s current White House counsel, Don McGahn, attended the Widener University Commonwealth Law School, in Harrisburg, Penn. Mr. Trump is not alone in holding a myopic, credentialist view when it comes to a person’s legal acumen; it’s no coincidence that every member of today’s Supreme Court is a graduate of an Ivy League law school, with Ruth Bader Ginsburg the only one not to graduate from Harvard or Yale (she began at Harvard but transferred to Columbia). These are, of course, excellent law schools, and there is no denying that there are better and worse places to get a legal education. But it doesn’t necessarily follow that only the Ivies can provide a top-flight legal education, or, more to the point, that a person’s abilities as a lawyer are entirely defined by the three years he or she spent in law school. Professional experience and judgment matter too. John Marshall Harlan, widely regarded as a “judge’s judge,” graduated from New York Law School. Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Supreme Court justice, earned his law degree from Howard University. Earl Warren: Berkeley. John Paul Stevens: Northwestern. The list goes on, but the point is that just because our president — and the public generally — obsesses over credentials that doesn’t mean we’re right to do so. "
1585,"To the Editor: Re “The Quiet Resistance Inside the Trump Administration” (Op-Ed, Sept. 6): The New York Times’s publication of an anonymous Op-Ed by a senior official in the Trump administration in this hour of crisis for the nation is of the highest public service. The piece essentially confirmed what many Americans had already feared, that this president is unfit to serve. It is a validation of the work of scores of journalists who, through meticulous reporting, have been raising alarm bells since the early days of Donald Trump’s presidency. It gives credence to the just-released excerpts from Bob Woodward’s book describing revolt inside the Oval Office. But make no mistake. What the writer is describing as a “quiet resistance” is nothing short of a coup in progress. It is a subversion of authority at the top of our government. It is stunning. And it cannot continue. If the instability of this president prompted “early whispers” within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office, one can imagine that those whispers, at this point in time, are reaching the level of screams. Either move forward on that front, or take your concerns to Congress. Make the case for the other available remedy in this calamitous situation: impeachment. It is time. Felicia Massarsky
Atlantic City To the Editor: I disagree with essentially all of President Trump’s policies and initiatives, and find his statements on race, immigrants and women (to name a few) abhorrent. However, The New York Times’s publication of an article written by an unnamed White House official is disgraceful. The author of the article remains anonymous, proclaims himself or herself as one of the good guys, and accuses President Trump of being “anti-trade and anti-democratic.” It is not acceptable to engage in personal attacks in an international newspaper while hiding behind a cloak of anonymity. If there is that much concern regarding President Trump and his actions, sign your name to the article and step into the spotlight. Furthermore, The Times should not have published an anonymous hit piece. Its publication plays directly into President Trump’s attacks on the media. "
1586,"NEW DELHI — The United States and India signed an agreement Thursday to pave the way for New Delhi to buy advanced American weaponry and to share sensitive military technology, strengthening their military partnership as both powers warily eye the rise of China. “Today’s fruitful discussion illustrated the value of continued cooperation between the world’s two largest democracies,” said Jim Mattis, the United States defense secretary, at a news conference on Thursday after the agreement was signed. “We will work together for a free and prosperous Indo-Pacific.” The countries also promised to hold joint land, sea and air military exercises in India next year. In the past, they have held joint exercises outside the country. But despite the friendly handshakes and flattering remarks exchanged as Mr. Mattis and Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, met with their counterparts in New Delhi on Wednesday and Thursday, the two countries remain deeply skeptical of each other. The United States is worried about how willing India will be to openly counter China as the Chinese expand their influence in the waters between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It is also unhappy about India’s reluctance to cut trade relations with Iran. India views the Trump administration as erratic, and it is troubled by the United States’ recent barriers to trade, which threaten to impose tariffs on Indian goods and force New Delhi to import more American products. "
1587,"The anonymous author of an Op-Ed article in The New York Times wrote this week that there were “early whispers” among President Trump’s advisers about trying to remove Mr. Trump from the presidency by invoking Section 4 of the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to declare that the president is unfit for office. Such a move would be unprecedented, and the author of the essay writes that the discussions did not move forward because “no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis.” The amendment, adopted by the states 51 years ago, provides a complex, difficult process for the removal of a sitting president. Here is a brief history of the 25th Amendment and an explanation of how it operates. The 25th Amendment to the Constitution is primarily designed to clarify the presidential order of succession. The first section of the amendment explains what should happen if the president dies, resigns or is removed from office: The vice president becomes president immediately. The second section makes it clear that when there is “a vacancy in the office of vice president,” the president shall nominate a replacement, who will take office once he or she is confirmed by majorities in both houses of Congress. "
1588,"Good morning on this roasting Thursday. The clock to the primary is ticking: We’re exactly one week out. And with that, four candidates to be New York’s next attorney general — all of whom you’ll see on the ballot next Thursday, Sept. 13 — will face off tonight in their final debate. Our Albany bureau chief, Jesse McKinley, gave us the rundown of what’s at stake in the race and why the post is so vital — particularly now. “The traditional purpose of the attorney general is to defend the state in the legal arena,” Mr. McKinley told us. “As we’ve crept into modernity, that mandate has broadened with the political ambitions of whoever has held that office.” (Eliot Spitzer used the power to prosecute cases on Wall Street, for example; Eric T. Schneiderman opted to dig into the activities of President Trump.) “So it can really be a way of investigating almost anything that touches on New York,” Mr. McKinley added. “Whoever is chosen will have their own viewpoint on what the office is supposed to do and what it can do — it really is a litmus test as to the interest of the attorney general.” "
1589,"Richard M. DeVos, the Amway Corporation co-founder who built and used one of the 20th century’s great personal fortunes to bolster the Republican Party, restore civic vitality to his hometown, Grand Rapids, Mich., and buy the Orlando Magic of the National Basketball Association, died on Thursday. He was 92. His death, at his home in Ada, Mich., was caused by complications of an infection, according to a statement on the Magic’s website. An evangelical Christian who espoused the virtues of self-reliance, capitalism and the free market, Mr. DeVos was above all a superb salesman. He joined Jay Van Andel, his friend and business partner for 55 years, in marketing the concept of direct sales and turned the privately owned Amway Corporation into a global enterprise with more than $8.6 billion in sales in 2017, more than 17,000 employees and hundreds of thousands of independent salespeople. At his death, Mr. DeVos and his family had an estimated net worth of $5.5 billion. His daughter-in-law Betsy DeVos is education secretary in the Trump administration. As his wealth increased, so did Mr. DeVos’s prominence as a political strategist and donor to the Republican Party and conservative organizations. He supported the Heritage Foundation, the Federalist Society and Focus on the Family, and he was a member of the executive committee of the Council for National Policy, which, starting in the early 1980s, pushed to propel Christian values to the center of Republican activities nationally. In the 1990s, the Amway Corporation spent $2.5 million a year on Republican candidates and party activities, making it the largest corporate political donor in the country. Mr. DeVos, who cultivated political allies with the deftness of a senior statesman, had also served as finance chairman of the Republican National Committee. "
1590,"WASHINGTON — North Korea engaged in a yearslong effort to hack into American companies and steal from financial institutions around the globe, the Justice Department charged on Thursday in a 174-page criminal complaint that detailed how hackers caused hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of damage to the global economy. Only one North Korean, Park Jin-hyok, was named — charged with computer fraud and wire fraud in the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment. But the complaint described a team of hackers for North Korea’s main intelligence agency, in many cases operating out of China and other Asian nations, who crippled Britain’s health care system in last year’s WannaCry attack and stole $81 million from the Bangladeshi central bank — a heist that would have reaped $1 billion, save for a spelling error — before turning to vulnerable institutions from Vietnam to South Africa. North Korea seemed primarily motivated by its continuing need for cash, as other countries have refused to do business with Pyongyang, and a desire to control American corporate behavior through fear. WannaCry presented the possibility that the North also wanted to sow chaos. The complaint was the most specific public accounting yet of North Korea’s cyberattacks against other countries. The Justice Department has now brought charges against state actors from North Korea, China, Iran and Russia, the United States’ most formidable cyberfoes. [Read the criminal complaint here.] The complaints and indictments have been seen as a key tool in deterring attacks; the Trump administration also imposed sanctions on Mr. Park as part of a broad punishment. But as officials tried to convey that North Korea would pay a high price for hacking American targets, President Trump undercut their effort with a friendly tweet about the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, hours before the complaint was announced. Mr. Trump wrote that Mr. Kim, whom he has sought to engage on nuclear talks, “proclaims ‘unwavering faith in President Trump.’ Thank you to Chairman Kim. We will get it done together!” "
1591,"The Trump administration moved on Thursday to remove court-imposed time limits on the detention of migrant children, proposing to end 20 years of judicial oversight and allow families to be held indefinitely in secure facilities as their cases wend through the immigration courts. The proposed new regulation reflects President Trump’s frustration that thousands of families from Central America and elsewhere are continuing to stream across the southwest border, assured in part by guarantees in the current legal process that migrants who arrive with children will not be held for long periods in detention. If approved, the new regulation would upend a body of rules for detaining migrant children that has been in place since 1997. Multiple administrations have challenged the rules, which stem from a consent decree in a federal class-action lawsuit over the physical and emotional harm done to children held in jail-like settings for extended periods. As recently as July, those efforts have been rejected by the judge overseeing the case. Rather than try its hand again in court, the Trump administration proposed on Thursday to withdraw entirely from the consent decree, saying that it would replace the agreement with regulations that would honor its spirit, and ensure that all migrant children in government custody are “treated with dignity, respect and special concern for their particular vulnerability as minors.” The decree was meant to be temporary until it could be codified into law. However, in announcing the proposed new rule, the administration said that it planned to change elements of the agreement that the advocates who negotiated it saw as fundamental — namely, a 20-day limit on detaining the families in immigration jails, after which they must be released unless they opt out by choice. “Today, legal loopholes significantly hinder the department’s ability to appropriately detain and promptly remove family units that have no legal basis to remain in the country,” said the secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen. “This rule addresses one of the primary pull factors for illegal immigration and allows the federal government to enforce immigration laws as passed by Congress.” "
1592," • The third day of confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh, and the second day of senators’ questioning, began at 9:30 a.m. and stretched late into the night. • The release of documents once marked “committee confidential” fortified Democratic questions on abortion, affirmative action and whether Judge Kavanaugh knew of Republican aides’ theft of Democratic computer files. • Many of those confidential documents spilled out in an anonymous release to The New York Times. Judge Kavanaugh’s abortion views created a stir outside the hearing room. Adding to the concerns of abortion rights advocates was a Kavanaugh reference to contraceptives as “abortion-inducing drugs.” He was answering a question from Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, about his dissent in a case involving Priests for Life, a religious organization that objected to a regulation under the Affordable Care Act requiring many employers to provide free insurance coverage for contraception to their female workers. The group had objected to an accommodation offered by the Obama administration that allowed it to obtain a waiver by completing a form. “They said filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion inducing drugs that they were as a religious matter objecting to,” Judge Kavanaugh testified. "
1593,"It is a selfish attempt at justification. And it is unlikely to be effective. That was the most common reaction around the web to the anonymous Times op-ed by a senior Trump administration official that harshly criticizes the president. I imagine many of you have read it, given the immense size of the article’s digital audience already. If you haven’t, the piece describes Trump as misguided, impulsive, unstable, erratic, ill-informed and anti-democratic, as well as “impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective.” It says that other administration officials are quietly defying him to minimize the damage he is doing to the country. But as many other writers have pointed out, the mere act of writing the piece — which has enraged Trump — will make it harder to quietly defy him. He is less likely to trust his aides and more likely to rely on a small cadre of loyalists. “He’ll grow more defiant, more reckless, more anti-constitutional, and more dangerous,” The Atlantic’s David Frum writes. The author’s real goal, many writers argued, was to justify his or her own decision to continue serving Trump.  “Nobody who’s part of the real resistance should be celebrating this,” The Los Angeles Times’s Jessica Roy writes. The more honorable path, many said, was a public resignation, coupled with an honest description of the president. [Receive the day’s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.] I think many of these commentators make good points. (And, for the record, I played no role in this op-ed and do not know the author’s identity.) But I would add one caveat — one way in which I think the piece is worse for Trump, and more helpful to the country, than many others believe. "
1594,"It’s a tough game to have to put on a fashion show in the current extreme news cycle. Especially when that show happens to be the first one of New York Fashion Week. You’ve got to make a pretty good case for your own relevance. Tom Ford could not have known he would open the spring 2019 collections hours after the Trump resistance in the White House tipped its hand, but it was a pretty sure bet something big was likely to happen. So it was a smart idea (and a lucky coincidence) he started with some resistance of his own. “I feel that fashion has somehow lost its way a bit, and it is easy for all of us to be swept up in trends that have lost touch with what women and men want to actually wear,” Mr. Ford said in notes emailed after his show. The front-row presence of Henry Golding — the newly minted “Crazy Rich Asians” heartthrob and probable fashion week most-invited, who donned a sleek white dinner jacket and black bow tie by Mr. Ford to take his seat between Anna Wintour and Cardi B — presumably being an indication of Mr. Ford’s own in-touchness. However, where Mr. Golding’s appearance might have suggested a look forward — or at least a keen sense of the current moment — Mr. Ford’s clothes seemed like nothing so much as a step back: to the beginning of his own career at Gucci in the mid-1990s, when Carine Roitfeld, the French stylist-turned-magazine-editor, was his muse, and his women ruled the C-suite in pencil skirts and stilettos. "
1595,"WASHINGTON — One by one, they came forward, almost as if in a virtual lineup. Not me, said the vice president. Nor me, said the secretary of state. Or me, said the attorney general. In a spectacle that may be without precedent even for an administration that has seen many of those already, almost the entire cabinet and leadership team working for President Trump pleaded not guilty on Thursday to writing an extraordinary anonymous essay about plotting against him. The unnamed author of the essay published by The New York Times was the target of a mole hunt by an infuriated president and the subject of an obsessive public guessing game that played out on television, online and in social media. While Mr. Trump and his staff lashed out at the news media, some privately wondered whether it would lead to a shake-up. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, an ally of Mr. Trump’s, recommended that the president force members of his administration to take polygraph examinations, and there was at least briefly some discussion of that among advisers to the president. Another option mentioned by people close to Mr. Trump was asking senior officials to sign sworn affidavits that could be used in court if necessary. One outside adviser said the White House had a list of about 12 suspects. The White House spent the day condemning the unnamed official and The Times for publishing the essay. “Anyone who would write an anonymous editorial smearing this president who’s provided extraordinary leadership for this country should not be working for this administration,” Vice President Mike Pence said. “They ought to do the honorable thing and they ought to resign.” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said anyone who wanted to know the identity of “the anonymous coward” should call The Times and she posted on Twitter the newspaper’s main switchboard phone number. “They are the only ones complicit in this deceitful act,” she wrote. “We stand united together and fully support our President Donald J. Trump.” "
1596,"The tabloid media had camped outside the five-story prewar building on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, hoping to catch a glimpse of the mystery woman who had stolen the heart of Cynthia Nixon, the “Sex and the City” star. From inside Ms. Nixon’s building, Christine Marinoni saw the paparazzi, braced herself — and walked right past. “They were looking for some blonde bombshell, or who knows what,” Ms. Marinoni said in an interview. Ms. Marinoni now laughs as she recalls the frenzied hunt for her identity in 2004, the bewildered reporters who did not know what to make of her — an unostentatious, redheaded community organizer, who preferred plaid shirts to evening gowns, and who before meeting Ms. Nixon had never subscribed to cable TV. The hubbub over Ms. Nixon leaving her male partner and dating a woman seems faraway, the product of a different time. And the celebrity magazines grew accustomed to the couple, gauzily covering their engagement, child’s birth and marriage. But Ms. Marinoni, who often uses “shy” as one of the first words to describe herself, never grew entirely comfortable with them. During her pregnancy, she hid her stomach with a bulky coat, surprising not just the paparazzi but even neighbors when she gave birth. “They were like, ‘Where did the baby come from?’” she recounted. "
1597,"The cameras that Fred W. McDarrah carried — a boxy old Rolleicord, and later a battered 35-millimeter Nikon S2 — weren’t special. Nor was he, not in his own mind. He was a bit of a square, he admitted, and an unlikely chronicler of the bohemian world he saw coming into view in Greenwich Village in the mid-1950s. What McDarrah (1926-2007) had was a drive to document, in galleries and lofts and cafes and bars, the painters, musicians, critics, bookstore owners and Beat-era poets and writers he sensed were making a new world, one that would spark the counterculture of the 1960s. “I was a groupie at heart,” he wrote later. “I wanted to be part of the action. My camera was my diary, my ticket of admission, my way of remembering, preserving, proving that I had been there when it all happened.” McDarrah was the first staff photographer at The Village Voice, America’s Ur-alternative weekly, founded in 1955. He’d been roommates with Dan Wolf, one of the paper’s founders. Wolf had seen the kinetic photographs McDarrah was taking when he wasn’t at his day job in advertising on Madison Avenue. McDarrah would go on to work for The Voice for 50 years. I wrote frequently for the paper in the late ’80s and early ’90s, but I met him only once. He was as unpretentious as they come. His mailbox at The Voice was marked “McPhoto.” A new book that collects the best of his work, “Fred W. McDarrah: New York Scenes,” is one that some people, myself very much included, have been awaiting for a long time. Its publication will be accompanied by an exhibition of McDarrah’s photographs at the Steven Kasher Gallery in Manhattan, which will run from Sept. 20 through Nov. 3. "
1598,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The defiant ones have come to California. Of course they have. Where else would they go? Mayors, governors, corporate executives and environmental activists from four continents are gathering in San Francisco this week to show what they can do to stave off the most catastrophic effects of climate change, even if the president of the world’s most powerful country — the United States, which is also history’s biggest polluter — won’t. It’s a gamble. As my colleague Brad Plumer writes, these defiant ones are trying to demonstrate that they can take big steps to cut the greenhouse gas emissions that have warmed the atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial age. But their efforts have not been enough to offset the effects of the Trump administration’s rollbacks on climate policy. And the world as a whole is nowhere close to meeting the targets set under the Paris climate accord three years ago, an accord that President Trump intends to withdraw the United States from. California is not just where some of the consequences of climate change are being felt acutely, nor simply a place where high-profile solutions are being tested out. It has also been a finger in the eye of the Trump administration on climate policy; for instance, it has challenged his rollbacks on fuel-efficiency standards. On Monday, Gov. Jerry Brown, who is one of the sponsors of the Global Climate Action Summit, signed a bill requiring California’s utilities to get all their electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2045. And former Vice President Al Gore struck a bullish note on the spread of zero-carbon technologies at an event on Tuesday. But he was also blunt about the pace of change. “We’re still not winning,” he said. “We have to make the decarbonization of the global economy the central organizing principle of human civilization.” "
1599,"Recriminations over a bridge opening. A false flier with a mysterious author. A cinnamon raisin bagel with cream cheese, lox and capers. So this is what a contested primary for governor in New York looks like. The long and often bitter battle between Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and his untested challenger, Cynthia Nixon, staggered toward Thursday’s finish line, with each side emptying its arsenal of attack lines amid a fusillade of bad press for the governor. From the time she declared in March, Ms. Nixon showed a taste and a talent for political invective, questioning “the old boys club” that runs Albany and whether the governor was “a real Democrat,” and promising to be a double-barreled trailblazer: the state’s first female and gay governor. For his part, Mr. Cuomo, a savvy political centrist seeking a third term, has had numerous institutional and financial advantages, including a war chest that topped $31 million at one point — enabling him to spend nearly $500,000 per day on the race as of late August. He also has been able to tout an impressive list of accomplishments in his seven-plus years in office, including a hike in the minimum wage, paid family leave, a strong gun control law and the legalization of same-sex marriage, a 2011 landmark that Ms. Nixon praised at the time. Ms. Nixon has trailed in every public opinion poll since her candidacy was announced, with the latest survey showing Mr. Cuomo with a whopping 41-point lead. But in recent days, the governor’s mojo has been battered by questions centered on his campaign’s involvement in a piece of campaign material that falsely accused Ms. Nixon of anti-Semitism. "

__________ A challenge every federal judge faces is deciding the appropriate punishment for a white-collar defendant. How much should a court take into account the background of these defendants who may not have previously run afoul of the law and are unlikely to commit additional crimes? Judges have broad discretion under federal sentencing law. A court must consider the seriousness of the crime and the need to deter criminal conduct, protect the public and avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among similar defendants. But judges do not have complete autonomy to decide what the sentence is. A recent decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit highlights the competing views on determining an appropriate punishment for white-collar criminals. In United States v. Sample, the appeals court overturned a sentence of probation for a defendant who defrauded investors of over $1 million after pleading guilty to mail and wire fraud charges. The recommended sentence for Matthew Sample’s crimes was well over five years. The sentencing judge, though, thought it better that Mr. Sample stay in his job with a six-figure salary than go to prison. The judge said, “I want you to keep your job, because I want you to have a good job to pay these victims back.” "

1602,"WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the former head of the Environmental Protection Agency who championed deregulation of the fossil fuel industry, is in discussions to work as a consultant to the Kentucky coal mining tycoon Joseph W. Craft III. Mr. Pruitt has remained largely out of the public eye since parting ways with the Trump administration in July under a cloud of ethics investigations into matters including his ties to fossil fuel industry executives with business before the agency. Mr. Craft, the chief executive of Alliance Resource Partners and a major Republican donor, enjoyed a close relationship with the E.P.A. during Mr. Pruitt’s tenure. Mr. Craft met with Mr. Pruitt at least seven times in Mr. Pruitt’s first 14 months at the agency and in December provided him with courtside seats at a University of Kentucky basketball game, a school where Mr. Craft is a prominent supporter. The former E.P.A. chief laid out his plans to develop a new consulting firm in one-on-one discussions with several executives during a Kentucky Coal Association meeting last week, according to industry officials familiar with Mr. Pruitt’s appearance and activities there. An executive with Mr. Craft’s company, Alliance Resources, confirmed the discussions in a statement Wednesday. “Any discussions that occurred between Mr. Craft and Mr. Pruitt are preliminary, and do not involve him becoming an employee of Alliance Resource Partners,” said Heath Lovell, vice president for public affairs at Alliance, in the statement. “Obviously, any discussions would not involve lobbying the federal government.” Under an ethics pledge imposed by President Trump, Mr. Pruitt would be barred from directly lobbying the E.P.A. for five years in any new role, but he would not be restricted from working as a private consultant advising the company on E.P.A. related matters or working on the state level to influence regulatory policy.

1603,"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Hey there, friends of the newsletter! We hope you can deal with change, because we’re making a few changes around here. But before we get to that, we’ve got a big, bad storm to talk about. Hurricane Florence is heading toward the Carolinas with the potential for devastating winds and storm surge at the coast and catastrophic rainfall over much of the region. The National Hurricane Center calls it a “life-threatening” storm. The hurricane center noted that, while the forecast track of the storm had shifted somewhat to the south by Wednesday morning, “The threat to life from storm surge and rainfall will not diminish, and these impacts will cover a large area regardless of exactly where the center of Florence moves.” So what does this have to do with climate change? Plenty. A warming planet doesn’t cause individual hurricanes, of course; they’ve been with us forever. But the effects of climate change have been linked to higher storm surges and rainier storms, and research suggests that powerful storms will grow even stronger in coming years as ocean waters grow warmer. There is even evidence that climate change causes hurricanes to linger longer, which Florence is expected to do. "
1604,"The latest and perhaps juiciest Trump tell-all to land this year isn’t from a disgruntled former White House staffer or a deeply sourced investigative journalist. It’s by Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels, the pornographic film star and unlikely feminist resistance hero, who has waged a legal battle over a nondisclosure agreement designed to prevent her from talking about a sexual relationship she claims she had with Donald Trump. On Wednesday, St. Martin’s Press announced that it will publish Ms. Clifford’s memoir, “Full Disclosure,” (pun likely intended) this October, just before the midterm elections. In a news release, the publisher said Ms. Clifford will tell “her whole story for the ﬁrst time,” including how she came to be a successful actress and director in the adult film business, her alleged affair with Mr. Trump and “the events that led to the nondisclosure agreement and the behind-the-scenes attempts to intimidate her.” “I own my story and the choices I made,” Ms. Clifford writes. “They may not be the ones you would have made, but I stand by them.” “Full Disclosure” follows other explosive books about Mr. Trump and his administration, including Michael Wolff’s best-seller “Fire and Fury,” James Comey’s “A Higher Loyalty,” Omarosa Manigault Newman’s “Unhinged: An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House” and most recently, Bob Woodward’s “Fear: Trump in the White House,” which has dominated headlines with insider accounts of turmoil, instability and paranoia inside the White House. Mr. Woodward’s book became an instant blockbuster this week, selling more than 750,000 copies, and Simon & Schuster ordered a ninth printing, which will bring the number of hardcover copies in print to more than 1,150,000. “Full Disclosure” could inflict further damage, and is likely to put the White House on edge. The publication will bring Ms. Clifford’s story back into the headlines, just weeks before the contentious midterm elections, and could draw new public scrutiny to her allegations about the affair and efforts by Mr. Trump and his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to cover it up.

1605,"Even though hundreds of children separated from their families after crossing the border have been released under court order, the overall number of detained migrant children has exploded to the highest ever recorded — a significant counternarrative to the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce the number of undocumented families coming to the United States. Population levels at federally contracted shelters for migrant children have quietly shot up more than fivefold since last summer, according to data obtained by The New York Times, reaching a total of 12,800 this month. There were 2,400 such children in custody in May 2017. The huge increases, which have placed the federal shelter system near capacity, are due not to an influx of children entering the country, but a reduction in the number being released to live with families and other sponsors, the data collected by the Department of Health and Human Services suggests. Some of those who work in the migrant shelter network say the bottleneck is straining both the children and the system that cares for them. Most of the children crossed the border alone, without their parents. Many are teenagers from Central America, and they are housed in a system of more than 100 shelters across the United States, with the highest concentration near the southwest border. The new data was reported to members of Congress, who shared it with The Times. It shows that despite the Trump administration’s efforts to discourage Central American migrants, roughly the same number of children are crossing the border as in years past. The big difference, said those familiar with the shelter system, is that red tape and fear brought on by stricter immigration enforcement have discouraged relatives and family friends from coming forward to sponsor children. Shelter capacities have hovered close to 90 percent since at least May, compared to about 30 percent a year ago. Any new surge in border crossings, which could happen at any time, could quickly overwhelm the system, operators say. "
1606,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. We’re watching hurricane maps and waiting for results in the Rhode Island primaries tonight. Unless you’re a serious political junkie, you’ve probably never heard of Faith Winter. But the 38-year-old candidate for the Colorado State Senate is running for a seat that has attracted intense focus — and spending — from both parties. That’s because if she wins, and other seats hold, control of the state legislature flips to the Democrats. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] Besides Colorado, there are a half-dozen states where Democrats are a few seats away from winning control of the state senate: • One seat away in New York, Maine and Minnesota. • Two seats away in Wisconsin. • Three away in Arizona and New Hampshire. “For state legislatures, it’s the number one race in the country,” Ms. Winter told me in a phone interview this week. “In Colorado, in order to flip the Senate, it’s just my seat that we have win.” “So, no pressure,” she added, with a laugh. There has been lots of talk about the “blue wave” that could break over Congress, turning over control of the House to Democrats. But in some states, that wave could end up looking more like a flood. While these races don’t have the flash and cash of a Senate or governor’s election, they matter a ton. Think about it: If the Supreme Court rules to undercut Roe v. Wade or the health care law, decisions on those policies goes to the states. "
1607,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — Despite attacks that have killed dozens of civilians at a time, the Trump administration on Wednesday certified that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are doing enough to minimize the deadly impact of their military campaign in Yemen. The certification, announced by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, was legally required to allow American military aircraft to continue refueling warplanes belonging to the two Gulf nations, the dominant members of an Arab coalition fighting a brutal war in Yemen that has helped create the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Mr. Pompeo’s move came amid rising concern in Washington about the coalition’s prosecution of the war and worries among some lawmakers that American weapons were being used to commit war crimes and that American officials could be held liable. In its efforts to oust Yemen’s Houthi rebels from the capital, Sana, the coalition has bombed weddings, funerals, factories and other civilian infrastructure, often with munitions acquired from the United States. The aerial assaults have elicited harsh criticisms from United Nations investigators and human rights groups, who have also accused the Houthis of violating the laws of war. Last month, the coalition launched an airstrike near a bus full of students on a religious outing, killing dozens in an attack that Human Rights Watch called “an apparent war crime.” In response to similar assaults, Congress included in a defense bill signed by Mr. Trump last month a clause that required Mr. Pompeo to certify that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were doing enough to avoid harming civilians. Without that certification, they would lose the aerial refueling services provided by the United States. "
1608,"For the latest updates on Hurricane Florence, read our Thursday live briefing here. As Hurricane Florence bears down on North Carolina, the state may face the consequences of policies minimizing the impact of climate change and allowing extensive development in vulnerable coastal areas. The approaching storm almost certainly gained destructive power from a warming climate, but a 2012 law, and subsequent actions by the state, effectively ordered state and local agencies that develop coastal policies to ignore scientific models showing an acceleration in the rise of sea levels. In the years since, development has continued with little regard to the long-term threat posed by rising sea levels. And the coastal region’s population and economy have boomed, growing by almost half in the last 20 years. The law, known as H.B. 819, was widely criticized and even ridiculed when it passed, but it was favored by the state’s business interests, which argued that it was needed to protect property values. Business leaders had been jolted by a state commission’s 2010 report saying that sea levels could rise as much as 39 inches by the year 2100, which would devastate the coast and swamp billions of dollars’ worth of real estate. Stanley Riggs, a retired research professor at East Carolina University who helped prepare the 2010 report, said that the research could have been used to tackle the difficult problems of development on the state’s delicate coast. “We were ready to step up to the plate and take a hard look at this long-term problem,” he said. “And we blew it.” "
1609,"A day after the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit, brought by the New York State attorney general’s office, that accused a financial firm of defrauding firefighters and others involved in the response out of funds meant to compensate them for resulting injuries and illnesses. The attorney general must instead use state courts to pursue any claims it has against the financial firm, RD Legal Funding, Judge Loretta A. Preska of Federal District Court in Manhattan said Wednesday. For the moment, the ruling handed a surprising victory to RD Legal, which the attorney general’s office said had used deceptive tactics to ensnare emergency responders and former professional football players in high-interest loans while they awaited settlements. Judge Preska said there was no basis for state authorities to continue their enforcement action in federal court after she dismissed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal agency, from the lawsuit in June. The judge tossed out the bureau’s claims that RD Legal had violated federal law after she determined that the structure of the agency was unconstitutional because of the way its director is appointed. That decision was at odds with a ruling in January by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which said there was nothing impermissible with the law that created the consumer bureau and allows it to be run by a single director. But the appellate ruling is not binding on federal courts in other districts, including New York. RD Legal, a New Jersey firm, sparked controversy by entering into financial deals with emergency workers who responded to the attack that destroyed the World Trade Center towers in 2001. "
1610,"And now, the politics of age. Hey, this is important. Grow up and pay attention. Young, left-leaning candidates are revolting against older, traditional Democrats in primary elections around the country. Meanwhile, the best-known, most talked-about potential presidential candidates are Bernie Sanders, 77; Joe Biden, 75; and Elizabeth Warren, 69. And in the House, where the top three Democratic leaders are in hailing range of 80, there’s a certain, um, restlessness on the part of the young folks. “I don’t care how good you are — there is a generational gap,” said Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut. Himes, 52, is the head of the New Democrat Coalition, a caucus of moderate party members. There are a trillion of these groups in the House, but I feel safe in saying that the New Democrat Coalition is more important than, say, the Cement Caucus or the Auto Care Caucus. We have had political generation gaps before. Back in the day, student protesters yelled “Never trust anybody over 30!” The people who did the yelling are now in their 70s, and I dare say have a more expansive view. The current gap is much more polite. (The millennials are coming!) In the House, it seems pretty much confined to the Democratic side of the aisle. Yet over in the Senate, only one of the six members over 80 is a Democrat. Dianne Feinstein, 85, is currently running for re-election against a 51-year-old state legislator who’s tried to claim Feinstein is out of touch without exactly mentioning her age. She’s expected to win another six-year term easily. However that won’t bring her close to the Senate longevity record. That belongs to Strom Thurmond, who retired in 2003 at age 100, and is mainly remembered as a horrible racist. Being old does not necessarily make you mellow. We saw a lot of the generational divide last week in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Critics from the left howled when Feinstein — the top-ranking Democrat — apologized to Brett Kavanaugh when the hearing on his Supreme Court nomination was disrupted by protesters. Feinstein is a centrist from the old school, which generally means more politeness and less twittering. "
1611,"WASHINGTON — Lawmakers pushing to more aggressively counteract Russian election interference dismissed a new White House effort to punish foreign election meddling as inadequate on Wednesday, pledging to try to secure a vote on more punitive legislation. Senators from both parties have been advocating the passage of punishing new sanctions authorities for weeks, and the process appeared to be gaining some momentum. But it was unclear on Wednesday whether an executive order signed by President Trump might have derailed those efforts. At least one senior Republican, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, held out the possibility that the chamber could still advance its own alternative but said it would be difficult to do so before November’s midterm elections. “It certainly does not foreclose congressional action,” he told reporters, praising Mr. Trump’s action. “But as you know, it is harder to pass legislation than it is for the president to sign an executive order.” Mr. Trump’s order gave the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, the power to investigate allegations of foreign interference and prompt sanctions against countries, organizations and people who illegally tried to influence the midterms. Mr. Coats said the order would mandate a 45-day close review of the midterms to determine whether foreigners had penetrated voting systems or launched a disinformation campaign. If intelligence officials conclude that a foreign power interfered in the election, Mr. Coats said, automatic sanctions will go into effect and the administration will review whether to further punish the offender. "
1612,"This is part of a series on what is at stake in New York’s primary elections on Thursday, and in the general election on Nov. 6. New Yorkers pride themselves on being among the most politically engaged citizens in the country. So why don’t they vote? From Buffalo to the Bronx, voter turnout in New York is abysmal. In November 2016, when everyone in America seemed to have a strong opinion about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, only 57 percent of the state’s registered voters showed up at the polls. That was lower than 40 other states. But it was at least better than New York’s turnout for the 2014 midterms — 34.4 percent, 48th in the nation. Only Oklahoma and West Virginia did worse. The picture in federal and state primaries is starker yet. Because New York’s electorate is heavily Democratic, the primaries effectively decide many elections. And yet in last year’s primary for mayor of New York City, only 12 percent of eligible voters bothered to weigh in. Why is it so bad? For starters, blame the state’s “stupid policy,” as a political scientist described it to The Times recently. Sure, there’s reason to criticize other states for cutting back on polling places or hours, or passing voter-ID and proof-of-citizenship laws that make voting harder, especially for minorities and other vulnerable groups. But who are New Yorkers to judge? Their own electoral laws and practices are mired in the Dark Ages, prevented from entering the 21st century by lawmakers trying to protect their jobs. It’s made worse by the city and state election boards, which run federal, state and local elections — a crucial job that needs to be done by professional, nonpartisan agencies. In New York, the boards are rife with incompetence. "
1613,"We have all heard the grim news. The middle class is shrinking. Income inequality is rising. It raises the question: What does it really mean to be middle class in 2018? Well, that depends on who you ask. And also where you live. According to an updated income calculator created by the Pew Research Center, a before-tax salary of $37,106 for a three-person household is considered middle class in Jackson, Tenn., the lowest threshold in the country. But in the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara metro area of California, it takes about $20,000 more; households of that size must earn at least $57,443 a year to attain middle-income status, the most money required of any area in the United States. “Our determination of whether or not you’re in the middle class is based on income alone,” said Rakesh Kochhar, a senior researcher at Pew. [Read how the recovery threw the middle-class dream under a Benz.] Pew defines the middle class as a wide range that is two-thirds to double the median household income in the United States. Those numbers are then adjusted to account for location and household size. By this standard, about half of American adults live in middle-class households. That is why the calculator, which is based on government data from 2016, says a household of three in the New York-Newark-Jersey City metro area that earns between $55,138 and $165,413, before taxes, is considered middle income. A household earning more than $165,413 is upper income and anything below $55,183 is lower income. "
1614,"Established Democrats have found themselves under siege from the left this year, with several prominent lawmakers falling to more liberal challengers. Molly Kelly, a former state senator, avoided that fate in New Hampshire on Tuesday night, defeating a progressive opponent to become the 15th woman to win her primary for governor this season. But in November, Ms. Kelly, 68, will be a decided underdog: Her Republican opponent, Chris Sununu, is one of the most popular governors in the country. Like most politicians, however, she is optimistic about her chances and undaunted by the challenge ahead. Ms. Kelly spoke to The Times about her victory, New Hampshire’s history of voting for women and what she thinks about President Trump. The following is an edited and condensed version of the conversation. Q. Congratulations again on your big win. Were you out late celebrating? A. It was a great night and an evening with so many friends and supporters and my family. But you know, the most important thing is we are up ready to go this morning. "
1615,"Julio V. Ruiz, a 71-year-old retired psychiatrist with a long history of participating in talks with the Cuban government, tried to ignore the persistent knocking at his door by two strangers when they showed up uninvited one afternoon last week. The rapping on the door went on for 15 minutes. It was the F.B.I. “Everyone tells you not to speak to them and to call your lawyer,” Dr. Ruiz said. “But you get scared. I was measured in what I said, and gave them a brief history of Cuba going back to the 19th century.” At least five Cuban-Americans in Miami, including Dr. Ruiz, who have opposed a trade embargo with Cuba and promoted better relations with the communist government in Havana, said they received surprise visits in the past week from federal agents. The law enforcement representatives were vague about their intentions, gave only their first names, and asked questions that seemed intended to learn about contacts with Cuban diplomats, Dr. Ruiz said. For many, the questions triggered decades-old concerns dating back to a time when ideological divisions in the Cuban exile community were more pronounced, and sometimes were coupled with law enforcement scrutiny. Those contacted were among a large group of exiles who came to the United States as children in the early 1960s, fleeing the Castro dictatorship. As adults, they supported engaging with the Cuban government, even when doing so was deeply unpopular in South Florida and often caused them to be ostracized. "
1616,"OTTAWA — A Canadian court has spoken. But Doug Ford, Ontario’s premier, says he knows better. Mr. Ford, a combative right-wing politician who has often been compared to President Trump, wants to cut the Toronto City Council in half, saying the move would reduce costs and bureaucracy. Ontario’s Superior Court, a trial-level court, on Monday declared the effort unconstitutional. Mr. Ford fired back on Wednesday by calling an emergency session of the Ontario legislature to invoke a rarely used federal law that allows provinces and the federal government to override, through new legislation, judicial decisions and parts of Canada’s constitution. “This is about preserving the will of the people, this is about preserving democracy,” Mr. Ford told lawmakers. His political opponents, as well as some political allies in his Progressive Conservative party, say he has gone too far. Mr. Ford’s suggestion that he “won’t be shy” about taking the step again when courts rule against his decisions in the future only added to their concern. “The backbone and the enormous strength of Canada is the independence and magnificence of our judiciary,” said Brian Mulroney, a former Progressive Conservative prime minister, at a public event in Ottawa on Tuesday, after Mr. Ford had announced his intent to override the court’s decision. "
1617,"WASHINGTON — Since President Trump took office, residents of deep-blue Washington and the surrounding suburbs and activists from everywhere have found plenty of ways, some more creative than others, to express their anger at him. One reliable target has been the Trump International Hotel just down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. Business owners and ethics lawyers have targeted the hotel with a steady series of lawsuits. Others have projected a steady flow of provocative messages — including the less than subtle accusation “Emoluments Welcome” — directly onto the building’s facade. The latest attempt to protest the president by targeting the hotel came on Wednesday, just as Mr. Trump was getting ready to welcome Republican donors to the hotel. A group of citizens — with the help of lawyers and the financial backing of Jerry Hirsch, an Arizona-based Republican and chairman of the Lodestar Foundation — asked the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board of the District of Columbia to review whether the president met the city’s “good character” test for holding a liquor license. The original 27-page complaint was filed in June, and was festooned with footnotes that point to reports of ethical breaches — though the complaint said the “number of such lies is too long to list.” As the summer passed, the complaint grew by dozens of pages as news surrounding the Trump White House unfolded. A plea deal struck with federal prosecutors by Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, who acknowledged in August that he had made illegal payments to women during the 2016 campaign who had claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump, resulted in another 50 or so pages of reading material for the board to consider. “This brings to the board evidence of Mr. Trump’s criminal conduct,” Joshua A. Levy, a lawyer who filed the complaint on behalf of the residents, said in an interview. “That may not rise to an indictment, but it is certainly evidence of bad character.” "
1618,"SAN FRANCISCO — A video posted to the right-wing media site Breitbart on Wednesday showed Google executives bemoaning the election of President Trump at a company meeting in 2016. The release of the leaked video is the latest volley in an expanding campaign by Republicans and allies in the media to demonstrate that Google and other Silicon Valley firms are biased against conservatives. Last week, Jeff Sessions, the United States attorney general, said he will meet with Republican state attorneys general this month to discuss whether social media companies are stifling conservative voices. Google has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks since Mr. Trump accused the company of gaming search results to suppress positive stories about his administration — a charge the company denied and that search experts said was implausible. The company also annoyed both Republicans and Democrats last week by declining to send a top executive to testify at a Senate committee hearing on foreign interference in elections. Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey attended the session, and a seat for a Google executive was theatrically left empty next to them. The hourlong video of a companywide meeting in November 2016 shows a parade of senior executives from Google and its parent company, Alphabet, expressing dismay about the election. Google often holds all-hands gatherings it calls T.G.I.F. meetings. They are usually streamed over the internet to company offices all over the world. "
1619,"On a Monday in late July, CBS’s board of directors convened a conference call to determine the fate of its chairman and chief executive, Leslie Moonves, who had been publicly accused of sexual harassment and assault. Some directors, led by CBS’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, thought that Mr. Moonves had to go. But the network’s longstanding hitmaker had been lobbying directors, arguing that the allegations were false or hyped. And his support ran deep. “We are going to stay in this meeting until midnight if we need to until we get an agreement that we stand 100 percent behind our C.E.O., and there will be no change in his status,” said one board member, William Cohen, a former congressman and senator who was defense secretary under President Bill Clinton, according to directors who heard the remarks and other people who were briefed on them. Another director, Arnold Kopelson, an 83-year-old producer who won a Best Picture Oscar for “Platoon,” was even stronger in his defense of Mr. Moonves, the directors and others said. “I don’t care if 30 more women come forward and allege this kind of stuff,” Mr. Kopelson said in a meeting soon after the conference call. “Les is our leader and it wouldn’t change my opinion of him.” What these directors didn’t learn until nearly two weeks later, according to a CBS director and people close to the board, is that one of Mr. Moonves’s accusers was threatening to go public with her claims. Instead of reporting the situation, Mr. Moonves was in the process of trying to find the woman a job at CBS in order to gain her continued silence. When the board learned about this, even Mr. Moonves’s staunchest backers were stunned. Their belief in his credibility was shattered given his previous denials of anything untoward, these people said. "
1620,"Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island defeated a liberal challenger in a Democratic primary election on Wednesday, according to The Associated Press, reasserting herself as the party’s leader in a state where she has battled criticism from activists on the left and intransigence from old-guard lawmakers in her own camp. Ms. Raimondo, 47, is expected to face a serious fight for re-election in November despite Rhode Island’s Democratic lean and the difficult political climate for Republicans nationwide. Polls have consistently shown her vulnerable to defeat, though she and her allies believe it will be difficult for any Republican to escape the shadow of President Trump, who is fairly unpopular in the state. She will face Allan Fung, the Republican mayor of Cranston who also ran against her four years ago in November. Complicating matters for both parties, Joe Trillo, a former Republican state legislator who chaired Mr. Trump’s campaign in Rhode Island, is also running for governor as an independent. Ms. Raimondo’s primary challenger, Matt Brown, attempted to channel the energy of the populist left, portraying her as overly close to powerful financial interests. Mr. Brown, a former Rhode Island secretary of state, collected endorsements from activist groups on the left, such as Justice Democrats and Our Revolution, a committee aligned with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. "
1621,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has signaled a new phase in its confrontation with Iran, threatening to retaliate for attacks by Iranian-backed militants in Iraq, even as it moves to avoid a potentially messy public split with allies over President Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal. Days after rocket strikes near American diplomatic facilities in Baghdad and Basra, the White House blamed Shia militia groups on Wednesday and said, “Iran did not act to stop these attacks by its proxies in Iraq, which it has supported with funding, training and weapons.” The statement came two weeks before Mr. Trump and Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, are both scheduled to attend the yearly meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, and it underscores Mr. Trump’s determination to raise pressure on the Iranian leadership. Mr. Trump had planned to use a session of the Security Council, which he is presiding over, to dramatize Iran’s malign behavior throughout the Middle East. But with aides and European allies warning that Iran could exploit the meeting to spotlight Western division over the nuclear deal, the White House has broadened the agenda to nonproliferation, a less loaded theme. Taken together, these two moves point to the challenge facing the Trump administration as it tries to shift the focus from the agreement brokered by Mr. Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, to Iran’s destabilizing actions in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. “They haven’t done a good job of articulating what their strategy is,” said Karim Sadjadpour, an expert on Iran at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "
1622,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has promised for years that Mexico would pay for a vast border wall, a demand that country has steadfastly refused. Now, in the Trump administration’s campaign to stop illegal immigration, the United States plans instead to pay Mexico. In a recent notice sent to Congress, the administration said it intended to take $20 million in foreign assistance funds and use it to help Mexico pay plane and bus fare to deport as many as 17,000 people who are in that country illegally. The money will help increase deportations of Central Americans, many of whom pass through Mexico to get to the American border. Any unauthorized immigrant in Mexico who is a known or suspected terrorist will also be deported under the program, according to the notification, although such people are few in number. Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the program was intended to help relieve immigration flows at the United States border with Mexico. “We are working closely with our Mexican counterparts to confront rising border apprehension numbers — specifically, a 38 percent increase in families this month alone — directly and to ensure that those with legitimate claims have access to appropriate protections,” Ms. Waldman said. A spokesman for the Mexican Embassy did not immediately respond Wednesday to a request for comment. The plan, which has been debated internally for months, is part of a broader push by the Trump administration to redirect billions in foreign assistance to other priorities. The administration has yet to spend nearly $3 billion in foreign aid, money allocated last year by Congress with broad bipartisan support. Hundreds of millions of dollars meant to help stabilize Syria and support Palestinian schools and hospitals has already been redirected. "
1623,"WASHINGTON — A year after presiding over a sluggish and chaotic response to a devastating storm in Puerto Rico, the Trump administration girded on Wednesday for a test of its ability to do better as Hurricane Florence continued to bear down on the Carolina coast. If responding to the destruction from Hurricane Maria last year in Puerto Rico was especially challenging — it was the third major hurricane of the season, it struck off the United States mainland and the local government was often overwhelmed — Florence presents more manageable logistics for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It is the first big storm of 2018. FEMA and state and local officials have had days to prepare, and the agency has positioned considerable supplies and personnel in the areas most likely to be affected. Two months before the midterm elections, President Trump has put himself front and center in the government’s response, suggesting that the White House will be fully invested in providing the necessary resources. Beyond the threat to lives and property, the storm also poses a formidable political challenge for Mr. Trump, whose public posture has been shaped by his penchant for self-congratulation and relish for lashing out at political rivals. Mr. Trump began his morning on Wednesday doling out A-pluses to his administration for its performance during last year’s hurricane season. He called its response to Hurricane Maria — whose death toll in Puerto Rico was recently estimated at 2,975 — “an unappreciated great job” in a Twitter post that blamed the “inaccessible island with very poor electricity and a totally incompetent Mayor of San Juan” for the devastation there. Mr. Trump also posted a video of himself in the Rose Garden of the White House in which he vacillated between sober warnings and exhortations to flee the storm’s path, and reassurance bordering on overconfidence. "
1624,"WASHINGTON — They’ve testified, tweeted, written and called with their concerns. Now American businesses, which have so far been unable to stop President Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs, are mounting a last-ditch effort to convince the president that his trade policies are hurting his political base. In a multimillion-dollar campaign that includes television advertisements, rallies in targeted congressional districts and online persuasion efforts, companies and business groups led by the National Retail Federation and an agricultural group called Farmers for Free Trade are highlighting the damage the tariffs are bringing to companies and workers in states with large numbers of Trump supporters. The effort, called Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, focuses heavily on the economic pain that manufacturers say is being inflicted upon industries that Mr. Trump champions and patches of the country that lifted him to the White House. It includes nearly 90 industry trade groups, like the Consumer Technology Association, the National Lumber and Building Material Dealers Association and the Toy Association. “We’re obviously trying to reach the White House,” said David French, the retail federation’s senior vice president for government relations, “and we’re trying to deliver a narrative to the White House that is clear and unambiguous, about the breadth of communities where the consequences of these tariffs will be felt.” But to persuade the president, companies must first win over the public — in particular, Mr. Trump’s most loyal supporters, who continue to back his trade policies by a wide margin. Eighty percent of Republicans support the steel and aluminum tariffs that Mr. Trump put in place this year, according to a survey conducted in early September for The New York Times by the online polling firm SurveyMonkey. Seventy-one percent of Republicans said Mr. Trump’s overall trade policies make them more likely to support a Republican candidate in the midterm elections in November. That tension between business groups — which have cheered Republicans over tax cuts and efforts to reduce federal regulation — and Mr. Trump’s political base has proved difficult for many Republican members of Congress to navigate. Though many have spoken out against some or all of the president’s tariffs, the Republican-held House and Senate have taken few concrete steps to push back against his policies. "
1625,"JERICHO, West Bank — When the Oslo peace accords were signed a quarter-century ago, residents of Jericho celebrated. Their dusty, 11,000-year-old desert city was given autonomy before anywhere else on the West Bank. Palestinians saw it as a foothold for what they trusted would become their own new state. But nothing has turned out as they expected. A shiny new casino, opened with great fanfare in 1998 to entice Israeli gamblers, has been empty since 2000, when they were barred from entering the city. The two-decade-old public hospital finally just got an elevator thanks to a donation from Japan. Perhaps the best-known institution of self-government in town is the jail, widely feared as a dungeon for political prisoners. The brilliant Palestinian future conjured by Oslo has instead become a bitter trap. The Oslo accords, first unveiled on the White House lawn with a handshake between Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat on Sept. 13, 1993, culminated in mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which Israel had long banned as a terrorist organization, and the first formal agreements in a phased effort to resolve the century-old conflict. They called for a comprehensive peace agreement by 1999, which was widely expected to lead to statehood for the Palestinians, and for Israel, realization of the long-held goal of land for peace. Today, however, the Oslo process is moribund, having produced neither a peace agreement nor a Palestinian state. About its only lasting substantive achievement is the Palestinian Authority, established as an interim self-government but still going two decades after its expiration date. The authority has made strides in providing basic services and created jobs for roughly a quarter of the work force, but it has grown increasingly autocratic and has been plagued by accusations of corruption.

1626,"FRANKFURT — When President Trump first provoked a trade war, the fear in Europe was that the biggest impact would be psychological. Executives would be rattled, and they would postpone or cancel plans to invest in expansion. Increasingly, that is exactly what seems to be happening: European factories are producing fewer goods, automobile exports are plunging and surveys show that business managers around the Continent are nervous. Soon, that will have a measurable impact on economic growth across the region. At least, that is what the European Central Bank expects. On Thursday, the bank lowered its projections for economic growth across the 19-nation euro area, and warned that any potential escalation of the dispute — which threatens to ensnare the European automotive industry — could create further headaches. Mario Draghi, the bank’s president, said in a news conference that rising protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility had “gained more prominence.” He added that the reduced forecasts were “mainly due to a somewhat weaker contribution from foreign demand.” He was speaking after a meeting of the central bank’s rate-setting committee, which held interest rates steady on Thursday and made no changes to its monetary policy. The European Central Bank’s Governing Council has outlined a plan for winding down emergency stimulus measures and shows no sign of changing course, despite a plethora of new risks. "
1627,"CBS entered a new stage of turmoil on Wednesday with the ouster of the longtime executive producer of “60 Minutes,” its flagship news brand, amid a cascading scandal over sexual misconduct that days ago ended the career of the network’s chief executive, Leslie Moonves. Jeff Fager, who was only the second person in 50 years to oversee “60 Minutes,” was fired for sending a text message that threatened the career of a CBS reporter, Jericka Duncan, who was looking into allegations of sexual harassment leveled against him and Mr. Moonves. The president of CBS News, David Rhodes, told staff that Mr. Fager’s departure was “not directly related” to those allegations of sexual harassment, which Mr. Fager has denied. But the network said the producer had violated company policy. It would be hard to overstate Mr. Fager’s power inside CBS’s news division, where he succeeded the legendary producer Don Hewitt in overseeing “60 Minutes.” Some members of the show’s staff were livid on Wednesday during a contentious meeting with Mr. Rhodes at the show’s Manhattan office. “I think it’s a terrible day for CBS News,” Sharyn Alfonsi, a “60 Minutes” correspondent, said in an interview before the specific contents of Mr. Fager’s text message were known. “I think it is awful. I don’t understand how you get fired over a text message.” CBS has enlisted two law firms to investigate its workplace environment, including accusations published by The New Yorker and The Washington Post that Mr. Fager touched female colleagues in ways that made them feel uncomfortable and allowed a culture of harassment to fester at “60 Minutes.” "

1629,"WASHINGTON — They wade across the Rio Grande with inner tubes to reach American shores. They walk through remote areas where the temperatures reach triple digits to evade immigration officials. Some will never make it, drowning while crossing the river or perishing while trying to keep up with smugglers who have left them behind. But despite the dangers, the migrants continue to come. Data released on Wednesday by Customs and Border Protection show that nearly 47,000 people were either apprehended by the Border Patrol or turned themselves in to customs officers last month at ports of entry along the Southwest border after traveling from mostly Central American countries. Over all, the number of migrants who were caught or surrendered in August is lower than in early spring, when the figure exceeded 50,000 people a month between March and May. Yet the August numbers are still higher than July when just under 40,000 people cross the border illegally or requested asylum at the ports. About 12,774 migrants, about 34 percent of the people apprehended by the Border Patrol, were in families with children. It is among the highest monthly tallies of families showing up at the border in the last five years, officials at Customs and Border Protection said. "

1632,"Good Wednesday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today. • The Department of Education has reopened a civil rights case against Rutgers University that the Obama administration had closed. The move injected federal authority into the campus battles over Israel, equating opposition to Zionism with  anti-Semitism and defining Judaism as an ethnicity as well as a religion. • Pressure is intensifying on undecided senators before a vote to confirm President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee. Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she has been targeted with a barrage of calls, some using vulgar language and threats, to push her to vote against Judge Brett Kavanaugh. • According to Donald Trump Jr., the president’s anxiety about whom he can trust has only increased in the days since anonymous administration members laid out in stark detail concerns about his ability to lead. • A broad group of governors, mayors and business executives declared last year that they would uphold the Paris climate deal, making a case to the rest of the world that they, and not the president, spoke for the nation. Now the group is at a critical juncture, the moment when it shows whether or not it can rise to the task. • The House of Representatives is growing increasingly diverse. But of the 40 top Democratic and Republican aides who lead the staffs of House committees, only six are nonwhite, according to researchers at a Washington think tank. Ayanna Pressley’s blowout victory over a 10-term congressman last week was the latest example of a trend that has become abundantly clear: 2018 is the year of the progressive insurgent, from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Andrew Gillum. But if you relied exclusively on polls, you may not have seen these results coming. A survey conducted in late July, more than a month before the election, showed Ms. Pressley losing by 13 percentage points; she ended up winning by 17. The last poll conducted by Representative Joseph Crowley showed him beating Ms. Ocasio-Cortez by 36 percentage points, but she ended up beating him by 15 in June. We asked four experts what could have made the polls seem so wrong. Some of it, they said, had to do with capturing the grass-roots energy of 2018. But much of the trouble is more mundane: Primaries are just really hard to predict.

1634,"SYDNEY, Australia — An Australian newspaper has defended its decision to publish a provocative cartoon of the tennis star Serena Williams, using the image again — this time on its front page — and railing against “politically correct” critics who deemed the drawing racist. The headline “Welcome to PC World” — accompanied by caricatures of Ms. Williams, Australian politicians, President Trump and Kim Jong-un of North Korea — was displayed on the front of the print edition of Tuesday evening’s Herald Sun, owned by Rupert Murdoch. “If the self-appointed censors of Mark Knight get their way on his Serena Williams cartoon, our new politically correct life will be very dull indeed,” the type below the headline said, referring to the cartoonist who created the drawing. Under the rendering of Ms. Williams are the words “Vetoed: large hair and lips, too angry.” The cartoon, which mocked Ms. Williams’s behavior during last week’s U.S. Open Women’s final, drew widespread criticism from athletes, fans and public figures around the world, including the author J.K. Rowling and the rapper Nicki Minaj. Critics said the exaggerated facial features of Ms. Williams were reminiscent of racist Jim Crow-era drawings and questioned why Naomi Osaka, the U.S. Open winner, who is of Japanese and Haitian descent, was drawn with blond hair and light skin. In an editorial published on Tuesday, the paper said the world had “officially gone mad,” and called accusations that the cartoon was racist “an attempt to defeat cartooning — and satire — with a politically correct barrage.” Damon Johnston, Herald Sun editor, said on Twitter this week that Mr. Knight had the “full support of everyone” at the newspaper. A spokeswoman for the paper said Wednesday that it would “let the coverage today speak for itself.” Mr. Knight deactivated his Twitter account on Tuesday to stop abuse directed toward his family, according to the Herald Sun. He has countered claims of racism by referring to his other cartoons, including one of Nick Kyrgios, an Australian tennis player who is of Greek and Malaysian descent. Mr. Knight has fended off accusations of racism before, including for his depiction this year of African teenagers vandalizing a train station. “I drew her as an African-American woman,” he said of Ms. Williams, according to the Herald Sun. “She wears these outrageous costumes when she plays tennis.” “So this whole business that I’m some sort of racist calling on racial cartoons from the past is just made up,” he added. “It’s not there.” "
1635,"NBC canceled Norm Macdonald’s appearance on “The Tonight Show” Tuesday after he made comments defending several entertainers accused of wrongdoing, including Louis C. K. and Roseanne Barr. He later apologized, but on Wednesday, while discussing the controversy, he gave it new life by telling Howard Stern, “You’d have to have Down syndrome” not to feel sorry for the victims of sexual abuse. The original remarks came in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in which Mr. Macdonald, the former “Saturday Night Live” cast member who has a Netflix talk show debuting on Friday, said he was “happy the #MeToo movement has slowed down a little bit.” He criticized a lack of “forgiveness” for the performers who had “all their work in their entire life being wiped out in a single day, a moment.” Louis C. K., a comedian who wrote the foreword for Mr. Macdonald’s 2016 book, “Based on a True Story,” was accused of sexual misconduct by five women. Ms. Barr, who gave Mr. Macdonald one of his earliest writing jobs, on “Roseanne,” lost her rebooted show on ABC after a racist tweet in May. “Roseanne was so broken up that I got Louis to call her, even though Roseanne was very hard on Louis before that,” he said in the Hollywood Reporter interview. “But she was just so broken and just crying constantly. There are very few people that have gone through what they have, losing everything in a day. Of course, people will go, ‘What about the victims?’ But you know what? The victims didn’t have to go through that.” Mr. Macdonald apologized on Twitter, saying the two performers were “very good friends of mine” but that he “would never defend their actions.” "

[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping the 2018 elections with our new politics newsletter.] The White House continues to reel from an Op-Ed article published in The New York Times last week by an anonymous member of the Trump administration. Seth Meyers caught his viewers up on the latest. On his return last week from a two-week vacation, Stephen Colbert revealed that he’d grown a beard over Labor Day. Then, this past weekend, the “Jeopardy!” host Alex Trebek unveiled a new beard of his own. That got under Colbert’s skin. So Colbert challenged Trebek to a trivia competition on “The Late Show” to determine who got beard bragging rights. Trebek revealed the beard to his fans in a video, saying: “I decided to regrow my mustache, but things got a little out of hand — these hairs kept attracting friends.” Colbert turned that around on him. "
1637,"A memoir like your new book, “Every Day Is Extra,” often means people are shaping their legacy. Is that something you’re thinking about now? No, I don’t look at the book as a political book. I really view it as a personal exploration of my life. The things I write about are the things most people have heard about. It’s an opportunity for me to set the record straight in a number of cases. You spent a lot of time with Senator John McCain and worked with him on normalizing relations with Vietnam in the 1990s. What will you miss about him? Just a camaraderie, a respect, a mutual willingness to tackle tough things and speak forcefully about controversial issues. And John was fun. He was quixotic at times and volatile, and that could occasionally be a challenge, but — and the “but” is capitalized — I think we shared a sense of obligation and a sense of commitment to duty and to live up to a certain ideal. You write that you considered having McCain as a running mate during your 2004 presidential run. Did you really talk about that with him? We really talked about it. We met in my hideaway in the Senate. We both knew there were some big hurdles getting your own party to accept the idea of dealing with certain issues. In the end, John felt very strongly that he wasn’t prepared to make the leap. We flirted, but we never had a date. The number of senators who have military experience is now way down to about 20 percent, compared with more than 70 percent in the early ’70s. What kind of ramifications do you think that has for policy? It’s a serious deficit. I’m not saying you have to have a specific percentage or something. But understanding how the military works, understanding the hierarchy, the sense of duty and honor and the weight of sending people into combat from the perspective of the warrior is a very important ingredient. It’s helpful in terms of other people’s perception of the decisions that you make or how you might be approaching them so that you can make sure it’s depoliticized. "
1638,"When Central Park Tours leads groups to the ice skating rink on the south side of Central Park, they reach a point where big red letters spell out the name of the facility’s operator: “Trump.” “We say, ‘Hey guys, you want to stop for pictures?’ And they are like, ‘No, no, no, let’s keep going,’” said Teodor Panterov, the tour company’s president. The number of visitors to New York City has broken records every year since 2010, and the economy is steaming ahead. But business is not thriving at the four concessions in New York City operated by the Trump Organization: a golf course, a carousel and two ice skating rinks. At each, sales have dropped or been flat since President Trump’s political rise, according to interviews and an analysis of city records. The Trump Organization attributed any dips suffered by these outdoor attractions to bad weather. And it emphasized that it had invested many millions of dollars in improving the facilities, which are owned by the city. “There is no connection to politics and usership at our facilities here in N.Y.C,” said Ronald C. Lieberman, an executive vice president with the Trump Organization. "
1639,"Once a year or so, the economist Diane Swonk ventures into the basement of her 1891 Victorian house outside Chicago and opens a plastic box containing the items that mean the most to her: awards, wedding pictures, the clothes she was wearing at the World Trade Center on the day it was attacked. But what she seeks out again and again is a bound diary of the events of the financial crisis and their aftermath. “It’s useful to go back and see what a chaotic time it was and how terrifying it was,” she said. “That time is seared in my mind. I looked at it again recently, and all the pain came flooding back.” A decade later, things are eerily calm. The economy, by nearly any official measure, is robust. Wall Street is flirting with new highs. And the housing market, the epicenter of the crash, has recovered in many places. But like the diary stored in Ms. Swonk’s basement, the scars of the financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession are still with us, just below the surface. The most profound of these is that the uneven nature of the recovery compounded a long-term imbalance in the accumulation of wealth. As a consequence, what it means to be secure has changed. Wealth, real wealth, now comes from investment portfolios, not salaries. Fortunes are made through an initial public offering, a grant of stock options, a buyout or another form of what high-net-worth individuals call a liquidity event. Data from the Federal Reserve show that over the last decade and a half, the proportion of family income from wages has dropped from nearly 70 percent to just under 61 percent. It’s an extraordinary shift, driven largely by the investment profits of the very wealthy. In short, the people who possess tradable assets, especially stocks, have enjoyed a recovery that Americans dependent on savings or income from their weekly paycheck have yet to see. Ten years after the financial crisis, getting ahead by going to work every day seems quaint, akin to using the phone book to find a number or renting a video at Blockbuster. The financial crisis didn’t just kill the dream of getting rich from your day job. It also put an end to a fundamental belief of the middle class: that owning a home was always a good idea because prices moved in only one direction — up. The bubble, while it lasted, gave millions in the middle class a sense of validation of their financial acumen, and made them feel as if they had done the Right Thing. "
1640,
1641,"It’s hard to overstate how deeply Americans despised their government’s response to the global financial crisis. It has helped shape the last decade of American politics, fueling distrust of powerful institutions and speeding a drift toward ideological extremes. But for all that anger, the engineers of the American crisis response got the economics mostly correct, and more right than most of those — including leading economic thinkers and prominent politicians — who were second-guessing them. I was a beat reporter covering the events at the time and the key players — including the former Treasury secretaries Hank Paulson and Tim Geithner, and the former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke — and then wrote a book on the crisis. Looking back on it a decade later, I’m struck by the way that I, and they, misunderstood what “success” would actually mean. The engineers of the response succeeded in their immediate goal, to preserve the financial system. But they — or, more precisely, they and their political leaders at the time — also left fissures that threaten to undermine the system they sought to preserve. The very underpinnings of modern capitalism are being questioned from all sides. A Republican administration has gleefully cast aside trade deals, for instance, and the energy among Democrats is around democratic socialism. To understand the challenges and ultimately the failure of the politics of their response, it helps to put yourself back in 2008 and 2009, when the financial might of the United States government — trillions of dollars, cumulatively — was deployed to try to contain the crisis. Mr. Geithner, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke are centrists in the context of modern American politics, but they are conservatives in the traditional sense — people trying to preserve a system they inherited. "
1642,"Why are Russians so good at vexing American minds? Vladimir Putin’s bewitchment of President Trump continues to frustrate intelligence officials and at times hard-liners in his own administration, while pro- and anti-Russia journalists trade insults as enthusiastically as they did during the 1950s Rosenberg spy trial. Beneath this lurks the uneasy feeling that our longtime superpower adversary remains our secret twin, matching us in audacity and ambition, just as it did all those years ago. “Listen now,” an NBC radio announcer declared in October 1957, “for the sound which forever more separates the old from the new.” The sound was the beep-beep of the radio signal emitted by Sputnik, the first satellite sent into space, as it streaked on its elliptical path at a surreal velocity of 18,000 miles per hour. The Russians’ early conquest of space came as a shock — “perhaps the darkest hour of the Cold War,” one historian has written — but it was also an exciting communal moment: Americans stumbled out of bed to watch “the sunlit speck sweep across the predawn sky,” Time reported, “as steady in its orbit as the made-by-nature moon.” The “space race” was a competition, but with only two rivals — “us” and “them.” And this odd partnership, or dance, spilled over into realms of the imagination, particularly the novel. In the aftermath of Sputnik three towering and best-selling works of fiction by dissident Russians — “Atlas Shrugged,” “Lolita” and “Doctor Zhivago” — were published in quick succession, crowded into an 11-month span, from October 1957 to September 1958. Today, all three still live on, each a universe in itself, read and discussed — and fought over — as if written not in prose but in hieroglyphics or code. Published less than a week after the Sputnik launch, “Atlas Shrugged” was the crowning work of Ayn Rand, a Jewish émigré from St. Petersburg (born Alissa Rosenbaum) who had gone to Hollywood in the 1920s, taking with her scenarios even Cecil B. DeMille’s story department deemed far-fetched. It was there that she developed an almost militant faith in capitalism. Her novel “The Fountainhead,” published in 1943, though panned by reviewers, became a word-of-mouth sales triumph and then a film starring Gary Cooper as a visionary architect modeled on Frank Lloyd Wright. Since then Rand had carefully tended her own growing legend. The immense “Atlas Shrugged” (1,168 pages) was famous even before it was published — the fruit of 13 years of intense work — with amphetamine-driven live readings for her entranced circle, or cult, of young acolytes, who gathered at her apartment in Manhattan. "
1643,"Television has been drawing A-listers routinely for a while now. But with streaming services, cable channels and broadcast networks locked in an evermore vicious battle for eyeballs, the fall season offers more intriguing veteran names than ever: Julia Roberts, directed by Sam Esmail of “Mr. Robot,” in Amazon’s “Homecoming.” Anthony Hopkins as Lear, also on Amazon.

1644,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Millions of people in the Carolinas and Virginia are either on the move or hunkering down as Hurricane Florence heads for the region, where it is expected to make landfall by Friday with winds of 130 miles per hour. The Category 4 hurricane could generate a huge storm surge and bring as much as 30 inches of rain, which could cause “catastrophic flash flooding,” the authorities said. We’re tracking the storm’s path, and providing live updates. Some misconceptions about hurricanes can be dangerous. Experts clear up three big ones, and we have tips for evacuating your home. • Amid the preparations for Florence, President Trump called the response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year “an incredible, unsung success.” Carmen Yulín Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, was among those who begged to differ. "
1645,"On Sunday the Sweden Democrats, a right-wing party with roots in fascism, scored their highest share yet of the Swedish parliamentary vote — and the mandarins of Europe breathed a sigh of relief, because that higher-than-ever share was only 17.6 percent, and there had been fears that the cleaned-up fascists would reach 25 percent instead. That such an outcome, in progressive Sweden of all places, came as a relief rather than a shock is a reminder of just how far populism has come, how much the fringes matter in Western politics and how weak the center has become. But the fact remains that the populists’ performance was a disappointment: Not a majority, not a plurality, not even a plurality of the combined right and center-right vote. The Sweden Democrats won enough votes to rattle an already rattled continental elite, and enough to confirm their country’s rightward turn on immigration, but their ascent is not yet the stuff of which a populist-led governing coalition might be made. Instead, the biggest story in the Swedish election, as in so many other Western elections lately, was fragmentation and its daughter stalemate — with declining or discredited parties of the center facing off against forces on the right and left that create majorities or near-majorities of opposition, but not of governance. That’s the scene in Germany and France, where Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron are isolated between restive rights and left. (Macron, the great centrist hope, has worse approval ratings than Donald Trump.) It’s basically the scene in Britain, where an ineffectual center-right prime minister, Theresa May, is trying to manage the populism of the right, while a populist of the left, Jeremy Corbyn, is locked in combat with a weakened center-left establishment. In a somewhat different way, allowing for our presidentialism and durable two-party system, it’s the scene in the United States. A right-wing populist insurgency appeared to take over the Republican Party under Trump, but it turned out to be ill-equipped to run anything larger than Breitbart News. So the Trump administration has mostly been run, ineffectually, by the discredited establishment that Trump defeated. "
1646,"For the latest updates on Hurricane Florence, read our Thursday live briefing here. Hours before Hurricane Florence is expected to begin its assault on the Carolinas, officials warned of fierce winds, catastrophic flooding, storm surges up to 13 feet and widespread power failures as they urged residents to get out while there was still time. Florence, now a Category 2 storm packing sustained winds of up to 110 miles per hour, is expected to pummel the region for days, starting with heavy winds along the coast on Thursday morning. The hurricane will then gather strength and spread inland as the center of the storm edges toward the coast on Friday afternoon, bringing torrential rainfall of up to 40 inches that will continue through Saturday and Sunday. Here are the latest developments: • The major power supplier for North and South Carolina, Duke Energy, said that the storm could knock out power for up to three million customers across the two states and that it could take several weeks to restore electricity. • The storm was predicted to slow and the eye could stall just offshore, battering the coast with high waves and dropping as much as 20 to 40 inches of rain in flood-prone coastal areas. • The center of the storm was in the Atlantic Ocean about 335 miles from Wilmington, N.C., on Wednesday evening, the National Hurricane Center said. It was forecast to crawl toward shore on Thursday and Friday, and move slowly along the coastline through Saturday. Follow the hurricane’s path here. "
1647,"To the Editor: Re “White House Set to Weaken Rules Curbing Methane” (front page, Sept. 11): In July the Environmental Protection Agency proposed weakening rules on carbon dioxide pollution from vehicles. Last month you reported that the E.P.A. wants to allow more mercury from coal burning. Now President Trump wants to weaken rules requiring companies to monitor and repair methane leaks. When will people wake up and realize that there is no Planet B? The planet is getting hotter, the weather is getting more extreme and we keep stoking the fires that can end the human race. For what, for money? We can take small but measurable steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to produce clean energy, to save ourselves from ourselves. But we don’t. We have the money, we have the technology, we have the ability, but we lack the will to act to save our own lives. Instead the Trump administration wants to prop up failing industries like coal by subsidizing them and removing regulations that are aimed at saving us. We should be investing in cleaner, greener energies like solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric and tidal. For those who claim that legacy industries would lose jobs, you are correct. They would be replaced by more jobs in the new industries. For those who claim this will be expensive, again, I say you are probably correct. But we can use the money we spend subsidizing the oil, gas and coal industries to fund these new industries. In the end, isn’t it worth the hardships, the money and the effort to save our lives, the lives of our children and our entire species? Gregory Foster
Grand Junction, Colo. To the Editor: As another potential superstorm bears down on the East Coast, following a summer of record-breaking worldwide heat, the Trump administration proposes the relaxation of rules on methane leaks, to the pleasure of energy companies. Much has been written of late regarding President Trump’s detachment from reality, the threat this poses to national security and the intercession by anxious White House officials. What to do, however, when the president’s detachment from reality matches that of the energy sector, its lobbyists and certain federal officials who willfully ignore the enormous and proven threat to national security (and planet habitability) of climate change?

1648,"Sept. 11 began like most days for President Trump — with rage-tweets. He complained about his Justice Department. He recapped the previous night’s Lou Dobbs show. He quoted a defense of him against charges of Russian collusion (“nothing to show”). Eventually, he turned to the solemn anniversary, praising his lawyer Rudy Giuliani for being a “TRUE WARRIOR” on 9/11, then added a reflection: “17 years since September 11th!” That night, a very different Donald Trump appeared on Twitter. For one thing, you could see him. Standing outdoors in a 1-minute 18-second video, he delivered remarks that were, if not polished, at least more settled: “As I stand on the really beautiful lawn of the Rose Garden at the White House, I think of the 3,000 lives lost with the horrible attack on New York City, the World Trade Center and, indeed, the attack on our nation.” The clip was the latest in a new, al fresco subgenre of the Trump oeuvre: a pivot to video that began rolling out on his Twitter feed in mid-August. As Olivia Nuzzi reported for New York magazine, the videos are a project of Bill Shine, the former Fox News executive who is now an administration communications official. The videos take advantage of the White House setting — lush landscaping, flattering light, sedate columns — and appeal to the reality TV star’s preference for speaking off-the-cuff, echoing his early social media “Trumpvlogs” in which he teed off on topics like the female reboot of “Ghostbusters”: The aesthetics of the Rose Garden videos are more YouTube than NBC, unadorned by graphics or soundtrack. (This stands in contrast with the White House’s more heavily produced videos, slathered with epic trailer music.) Mr. Trump stands stiffly, glowering at the camera, and speaks about trade, the stock market, the negotiations with North Korea. (“Nothing bad can happen. It’s only going to be positive.”) "
1649,"Planned Parenthood, under fire from conservatives in Washington and state capitols, chose Leana Wen, an emergency room doctor whose family fled China when she was a child, as its next president Wednesday, picking a woman who won praise for her steadying hand as Baltimore’s health commissioner during the city’s convulsive protests in 2015. Dr. Wen, 35, grew up poor in Compton, Calif., after her family left China following the Tiananmen Square massacre just before her eighth birthday. She relied on Medicaid as a child, and in nearly four years in Baltimore has drawn acclaim for working with corporations and churches to close racial disparities in health care and sharply reducing infant mortality. She has also pushed back aggressively on the Trump administration’s cuts to health care. She will take over Planned Parenthood’s leadership at a particularly fraught time. While Americans overwhelmingly support the organization, its Republican critics are pushing to cut its funding and eviscerate or overturn Roe v. Wade, and the Supreme Court is poised to tilt further right as critical cases on women’s health advance through the courts. Earlier this year, Baltimore sued the Trump administration for cutting teen pregnancy prevention funds, which resulted in a federal judge ordering $5 million in grant funding to be restored to two of the city’s programs. She fought to preserve Title X funding for the city’s health clinics for low-income women, and is leading a lawsuit that accuses the administration of intentionally and unlawfully sabotaging the Affordable Care Act. “Anyone who has worked with Dr. Wen knows that when it comes to protecting her patients, she doesn’t back down from a fight,” said Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, for whom Dr. Wen has said she named her son. “In Baltimore, she has expanded care, found solutions around obstacles, and, most important of all, saved lives. While Baltimore is losing its ‘Doctor for the City,’ Planned Parenthood is gaining a powerful new advocate.” [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping the 2018 elections with our new politics newsletter.] "
1650,"Good Wednesday. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. In 2014, James Katzman, then leading Goldman’s West Coast M.&A. practice, called the firm’s whistle-blower hotline. Colleagues, he said, had tried repeatedly to obtain and share confidential client information. But an NYT report reveals that instead of being investigated by outside lawyers, his allegations were picked up by Goldman’s general counsel and top executives — including David Solomon, the C.E.O.-in-waiting. Here’s how Emily Flitter, Kate Kelly and Dave Enrich describe his role: Mr. Katzman left the firm in 2015 and signed a confidentiality agreement. Goldman’s board will hear about Mr. Solomon’s interactions with Mr. Katzman at a scheduled board meeting tomorrow. Apple will unveil its latest batch of products today at its Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, Calif. Rumors suggest an update to the iPhone X, a larger version of the X, and a cheaper large-screen model. By this point, smartphone sales have matured, so Apple has worked on persuading customers to pay more — the current X is $1,000 — and short sellers are betting that strategy will run out of steam. Today won’t just feature iPhones, however. A larger Apple Watch could make an appearance, as could updated wireless AirPod earbuds. And Apple’s wireless charging station could finally be announced. Less likely are a replacement for the MacBook Air, an update to the iPad Pro, or even a new Mac Mini desktop. Expect some software announcements as well, and perhaps an update on content. Many companies across America have complained about the White House’s tariffs on imported goods. Now a huge (and eclectic) group of them — from energy industry groups to Maine lobstermen — have created a lobbying campaign on the issue, called Tariffs Hurt the Heartland. "
1651,"THE EMBATTLED VOTE IN AMERICA
From the Founding to the Present
By Allan J. Lichtman
315 pp. Harvard University Press. $27.95. Protesters marched through Marion, Ala., on a winter night in 1965. Suddenly, the streetlights went dark and troopers charged into the crowd, beating them with clubs and blinding them with flashlights. Jimmie Lee Jackson fled with his mother and grandfather into Mack’s Café, where the police chased after them, threw him against a cigarette machine and fatally shot him in the stomach — one more victim in the battle for the right to vote in America. Fast-forward 35 years to the Bush-Gore debacle of 2000. Republican election officials in Florida quietly dumped 180,000 ballots, casting aside one in 10 African-American votes, often for minor irregularities. Republicans on the Supreme Court invoked two centuries of jurisprudence when they stopped a recount: “The individual citizen has no federal constitutional right to vote for electors for the president of the United States.” Allan J. Lichtman’s important book emphasizes the founders’ great blunder: They failed to enshrine a right to vote in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights. Instead, the Constitution handed control over elections to state and local governments. Local officials developed thousands of different electoral systems with no uniform standards or regulations and little oversight. Elections were organized and supervised by partisans brazenly angling for advantage. “The Embattled Vote in America” traces the consequences through American history. Reforms, when they came, often provoked a backlash. For example, in 1870 the 15th Amendment barred states from abridging the vote on account of race. A stronger version would have finally affirmed voting rights and prohibited restrictions like poll taxes or literacy tests. This version fell short in Congress because Northerners wanted to bar Irish voters and Westerners to ban Chinese-Americans. Even the weaker version of the amendment helped incite a reign of terror in the South and its loopholes eventually enabled the restoration of white supremacy. "
1652,"PARSIPPANY, N.J. — Mikie Sherrill, Democratic candidate for Congress, had finished a radio interview and was heading toward the stage at the local library where a crowd waited for her to begin an event with the mayor and a native-son-turned-astronaut. But first, there was a smudge of chocolate to be dealt with. Ms. Sherrill reached down and cleaned the face of her 6-year-old daughter, Marit, who squirmed, pigtails shaking. “I’m doing it,” Ms. Sherrill insisted. Her 8-year-old seized on the distraction to ask if he could have a cookie. “One,” his mother told him. She briefly chided her 12-year-old for letting Marit get chocolate on her face, then took her seat on stage, settling in with a broad smile and the perfect posture honed by her days at the United States Naval Academy — apparently immune to the funny faces Marit was making from the front row. Ms. Sherrill is often introduced as “Navy pilot, federal prosecutor and mother of four,” as if the descriptions should be hyphenated. But as she campaigns around this suburban battleground House district her role as a mother is the one most on display. Her children march in the front row of parades, tumble out of the family’s SUV with lacrosse sticks in a television ad, and milled in the crowd at Ms. Sherrill’s event with Joe Biden along with the children of her volunteers, many of whom are mothers from her children’s schools. It is also the role that makes her campaign — and that of many other women running for office this year — so revolutionary. Male candidates have long been able to use their children to appear more youthful, human and charming: John F. Kennedy, Jr. peeking out from his father’s desk in the Oval Office, Andrew Giuliani antically upstaging his father during his inauguration as mayor of New York. "
1653,"As the elaborate post-mortem of the presidential election drags on — amid all the diagnoses of Russian interference, Clintonian blunders and white-working-class resentment — Carol Anderson wants to direct your attention to one simple fact: In November 2016, black voter turnout fell by 7 percent. Anderson rebukes anyone who takes this as a facile statement of how black voters felt about Hillary Clinton. “Minority voters did not just refuse to show up,” she writes in “One Person, No Vote: How Voter Suppression Is Destroying Our Democracy.” “Republican legislatures and governors systematically blocked African-Americas, Hispanics and Asian-Americans from the polls.” The 2016 presidential election was the first in 50 years to be held without the full protections of the Voting Rights Act. Three years before, in 2013, the Supreme Court had revoked the part of the law that required states with a history of voting discrimination to get federal approval in order to change their voting statutes. The ruling effectively left voters at the mercy of state legislators. Some of these law makers, like the Republican Party itself, didn’t draw significant support from minority communities. So in the interests of self-preservation, Anderson says, they changed the laws in ways that made it harder for minorities to vote. President Donald J. Trump is just one result; a profound and polarizing distortion of American democracy is another. Anderson’s argument isn’t new. Ari Berman, the author of the excellent “Give Us the Ballot” (2015), has been making a similar case to anyone who will listen. His book also included original reporting, and interviews with lawyers, activists and government officials who experienced the implementation of the 1965 Voting Rights Act firsthand. Anderson, a professor of African-American studies at Emory University, has written a slender volume that is one part historical primer and one part spirited manifesto, and is clearly timed for the midterms. (Don’t let the number of pages fool you; more than 100 of them are for endnotes. Anderson has a distracting tendency to quote even basic factual phrases — like “the State’s federal public housing residents” — instead of simply stating or rewording them.) “One Person, No Vote” reads like a speedy sequel of sorts to her previous book, the elegant and illuminating best-seller “White Rage” (2016), which traced how periods of black progress have so often triggered a backlash that “wreaks havoc subtly, almost imperceptibly” through the legislatures and courts. “White rage doesn’t have to wear sheets, burn crosses or take to the streets,” she wrote. “Working the halls of power, it can achieve its ends far more effectively, far more destructively.” "
1654,"The establishment or the upstart? It’s a common question put to voters these days, and one that New Yorkers will be considering on Thursday, when they vote in the state primary elections. Last week, The Times’s editorial board endorsed Andrew Cuomo, the incumbent, for the Democratic nomination for governor, over Cynthia Nixon. (In an earlier editorial, it endorsed Zephyr Teachout as Democrats’ best choice for attorney general.) Many readers agreed that, though deeply flawed, Mr. Cuomo has the political savvy to solve New York City’s subway crisis and to stand up for constituents against President Trump. Others were more energized by Ms. Nixon, the actress and activist, who has committed to reform Albany. And so for a taste of the tug of war between the old guard and the new groove, here is a selection of reader comments, edited for clarity and length. At the start of her candidacy, I feared Nixon didn’t have the chops for the job, but I’ve listened closely to her over these months and she says the things that I, as a progressive, actually believe in. She is openly, confidently on the left end of the political spectrum, while Cuomo has to have his job threatened to enact real progressive policy. — BrooklynGal, New York It is clear that Governor Cuomo has allowed the N.Y.C. subway system to decay and become a daily nightmare for working people. On Sept. 13, I’m voting as a commuter. Yes, unlike The Times, I’m a single issue voter this year. Every New Yorker should vote against Cuomo and his corrupt management of the M.T.A. Every day I’m reminded of his legacy — the subway — and it’s a disgrace. — patrick.nolan, Brooklyn, N.Y. I am not happy with the editorial board’s endorsement of Cuomo. He has all the flaws of an incumbent, having been in power for so long that he has become complacent and arrogant. Cynthia Nixon is correct. Cuomo, in the bluest of blue states, has chosen to elevate Republicans in state congress while being slow to execute many progressive agendas. — May MacGregor, New York "
1655,"WASHINGTON — The income of the median American household has finally rebounded from the damage caused by the 2008 financial crisis, a significant milestone in the nation’s painfully slow economic recovery. Median household income reached $61,372 in 2017, the Census Bureau reported on Wednesday, a number that it said was statistically indistinguishable from the median on the cusp of the crisis, in 2007. The Trump administration, in a statement released by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, hailed the report as an indication of a strengthening American economy. “The effects of the strong economy are reaching Americans throughout the United States,” the statement said, adding, “The news is actually better than these numbers suggest.” But the details of the report raised questions about whether middle-class households — which have experienced an economic “lost decade” — are now likely to see actual income gains or if they will simply tread water. One reason for concern is that income growth slowed in 2017, to 1.8 percent. Median income had grown more rapidly in previous years, by 5.2 percent in 2015 and 3.2 percent in 2016. The gains in income were also driven by increased employment, rather than increased pay. The average annual earnings of both male and female full-time workers actually declined last year, but that drop was offset in the national data by the increase in the number of people with jobs. “We have tight labor markets but not tight enough to generate a break from the trend — to spur meaningful wage growth,” said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. "
1656,"WASHINGTON — The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday declared that teenage use of electronic cigarettes has reached “an epidemic proportion,” and it put makers of the most popular devices on notice that they have just 60 days to prove they can keep their devices away from minors. The order was part of a sweeping government action that targeted both makers and sellers of e-cigarettes. If Juul Labs and four other major manufacturers fail to halt sales to minors, the agency said, it could remove their flavored products from the market. It also raised the possibility of civil or criminal charges if companies are allowing bulk sales through their websites. The agency said it was sending warning letters to 1,100 retailers — including 7-Eleven stores, Walgreens, Circle K convenience shops and Shell gas stations — and issued another 131 fines, ranging from $279 to $11,182, for selling e-cigarettes to minors. Federal law prohibits selling e-cigarettes to anyone under 18. In a briefing with reporters, the F.D.A. commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, said that more than two million middle and high school students were regular users of e-cigarettes last year. The government’s tactics underscore a dilemma in the public health community: In addressing one public health problem — cigarette smoking, which kills 480,000 people in the United States each year — e-cigarettes are creating another — hooking teenagers who have never smoked on nicotine. E-cigarette users inhale far fewer toxic chemicals than do smokers of traditional cigarettes. But they can take in higher levels of nicotine, which is addictive. "
1657,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. On Sunday, Hurricane Florence was a relatively mild Category 1 storm. By Monday, it had grown to be a Category 4 storm. That kind of rapid escalation isn’t normal — or at least it didn’t used to be. Thanks to climate change, however, the sudden intensification of hurricanes appears to have become more common. “This process — hurricanes intensifying fast — is both extremely dangerous and poorly understood,” Chris Mooney of The Washington Post writes. “But new research says that as the climate continues to warm, storms will do it faster and more often.” Mooney’s piece quotes Kieran Bhatia, lead author of the new research, as saying, “The reason there are going to be more major hurricanes is not necessarily [because] there are going to be that many more storms … it’s really the fact that those storms are going to get there faster.” Regular readers of this newsletter know that I think it’s important to talk about climate change during extreme weather events. Yes, it’s true that no individual storm can be blamed solely on climate change. But it’s also true that climate change has that name for a reason: It is changing the climate — and the weather. Hurricanes are becoming more powerful. Extreme rainstorms (as this chart shows) are becoming more common, as are droughts and heat waves. Given that data and academic studies don’t seem to have persuaded the current United States government — and a significant chunk of the country’s voters — to take climate change seriously, maybe the weather eventually will. "
1658,"WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security transferred nearly $10 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to a budget document released by a Democratic senator late Tuesday night, diverting funds from the relief agency at the start of the hurricane season that began in June. The release of the document comes as a major storm barrels toward the East Coast. The document, which was released by the office of Senator Jeff Merkley, of Oregon, shows that the money would come from FEMA’s operations and support budget and was transferred into accounts at ICE to pay for detention and removal operations. The document also shows that the Department of Homeland Security transferred money from accounts at Customs and Border Protection that pays for border fencing and technology. The transfer was a part of more than $200 million the Department of Homeland Security moved from the budgets of other agencies to ICE’s detention and removals. Mr. Merkley, appearing Tuesday night on “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC, said the Trump administration was taking money from FEMA’S “response and recovery” and “working hard to find funds for additional detention camps.” Mr. Merkley has been a vocal critic of the administration’s immigration policies. The Department of Homeland Security denies that any money transferred came from FEMA’s disasters relief accounts, which pay for work related to hurricanes and other natural disasters. “Under no circumstances was any disaster relief funding transferred from @fema to immigration enforcement efforts,” Tyler Q. Houlton, an agency spokesman, said on Twitter. “This is a sorry attempt to push a false agenda at a time when the administration is focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster.” "
1659,"European lawmakers voted by a wide margin on Wednesday to begin a punishment procedure against Hungary for potentially breaching democratic norms, a measure never previously initiated by the European Parliament. The vote was only the first step toward potential sanctions. The leaders of the European Union’s 28 member states must ultimately decide if the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban is at fault, and whether it should be punished. But it was nevertheless a meaningful moment in contemporary European politics, because it showed Mr. Orban — for years sheltered by Europe’s center-right leaders, even as he undermined the rule of law in Hungary, criticized European institutions, and became a hero of the far right — losing the support of most of his allies in the European mainstream. The measure passed 448-197, narrowly meeting a two-thirds threshold needed to validate it, after a majority of Mr. Orban’s conservative alliance broke with him. That alliance, the European People’s Party, whose members include the leaders of the European Parliament, European Commission and European Council, as well as Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, had avoided publicly criticizing Mr. Orban, despite rising external objections to his autocratic tendencies in Hungary and his shift toward more extreme positions on European identity, migration and integration. "
1660,"SAN FRANCISCO — Mark Zuckerberg began the year by promising to make Facebook safer from election interference around the world. He has spent most of the rest of the year apologizing for not recognizing the problem earlier. On Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, published a roughly 3,300-word blog post cataloging all the steps the company has taken. “In 2016, we were not prepared for the coordinated information operations we now regularly face,” he wrote, alluding to Russian interference in the American presidential election. “But we have learned a lot since then and have developed sophisticated systems that combine technology and people to prevent election interference on our services.” “Today, Facebook is better prepared for these kinds of attacks,” he added. The unusual post is an answer of sorts to Facebook’s controversy-ridden last 18 months and reflects how Mr. Zuckerberg has staked his reputation on reducing the disinformation, divisive messages and false news that have spread on the site. While the chief executive often takes to his personal Facebook page to write short notes about the company, he said this month that he would publish pieces looking more in depth at issues facing it, starting with a post about securing elections worldwide. In April, Mr. Zuckerberg testified in Congress about Russian manipulation of Facebook before the 2016 election, with lawmakers grilling him on the company’s lack of awareness of the misuse. Since then, he has grappled with reports of disinformation campaigns on his platform in countries ranging from India to Mexico. And last week, Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, also showed up in Congress to talk about foreign interference on her company’s site. Facebook faces several coming tests of whether it can detect and stop election interference: The company is being scrutinized for its role in Brazil’s presidential election next month, and the November midterm elections in the United States are fast approaching. "
1661,"WASHINGTON — The foreign-born population in the United States has reached its highest share since 1910, according to government data released Thursday, and the new arrivals are more likely to come from Asia and to have college degrees than those who arrived in past decades. The Census Bureau’s figures for 2017 confirm a major shift in who is coming to the United States. For years newcomers tended to be from Latin America, but a Brookings Institution analysis of that data shows that 41 percent of the people who said they arrived since 2010 came from Asia. Just 39 percent were from Latin America. About 45 percent were college educated, the analysis found, compared with about 30 percent of those who came between 2000 and 2009. “This is quite different from what we had thought,” said William H. Frey, the senior demographer at the Brookings Institution who conducted the analysis. “We think of immigrants as being low-skilled workers from Latin America, but for recent arrivals that’s much less the case. People from Asia have overtaken people from Latin America.” The new data was released as the nation’s changing demography has become a flash point in American politics. President Trump, and many Republicans, have sounded alarms about immigration and suggested the government needs to restrict both the number and types of people coming into the country. The foreign-born population stood at 13.7 percent in 2017, or 44.5 million people, according to the data, compared with 13.5 percent in 2016. The last historic peak in immigration to the United States came at the end of the 19th century, when large numbers of Europeans fled poverty and violence in their home countries. Some of the largest numbers came from Germany, Italy and Poland. That wave peaked around the turn of the century, when the total foreign-born population stood at nearly 15 percent. But after the passage of strict racial quotas in the 1920s, the foreign-born population fell sharply for decades in the middle of the 20th century. By 1970, the population was below 5 percent. "
1662,"KABUL, Afghanistan — An American aid project in Afghanistan that was billed as the world’s biggest program ever designed purely for female empowerment has been a failure and a waste of taxpayers’ money, the head of a government watchdog agency has charged. The project by the United States Agency for International Development, which was named Promote, was originally budgeted at $280 million and was supposed to help 75,000 Afghan women get jobs, promotions, apprenticeships and internships. Three years later, one of the few concrete results cited in a study of the project released on Thursday by the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction was the promotion of 55 women to better jobs. But the report said it was unclear whether the program could even be credited for those promotions. “We can’t find any good data that they’re helping any women,” said John L. Sopko, the head of the watchdog agency, which was established by Congress to monitor American spending in Afghanistan. “And then we start hearing from women’s groups in Afghanistan, from everybody from Rula Ghani on down, that this program is poorly designed and oversold,” he said in an interview on Tuesday, referring to Afghanistan’s first lady. Ms. Ghani complained in a 2016 interview with the agency that much of the money for the program would go to administrative costs and American contractors rather than to Afghan women. The Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction has repeatedly criticized American aid projects in Afghanistan as wasteful and poorly conceived. "

1664,"Fiction podcasts have always felt one step behind the culture. The audio drama’s great and unexpected resurgence in this decade, thanks to the rise of podcasting’s listen-whenever-and-wherever-you-like technology, has produced a cutting-edge genre that seems somehow suspended in time. Maybe it’s because so many scripted podcasts have borrowed from old radio plays. Or maybe it’s because they’ve so often leaned into genre storytelling, leaving social reality behind to build fantasy worlds and unravel mysteries. The experimental sandbox of the new form has produced sharp plots and intriguing aural soundscapes but few stories that seem to access something bigger than themselves. The moment that changed, for me, came when I was white-knuckling the pole in a crowded subway car, piping the pilot of the politically charged dystopian fantasy “Adventures in New America” into my ears (the premiere is on Sept. 28). I began to sense the world developing in my head as more immediate than the human crush of my commute. I felt something similar a few days later, running down the street and listening to the first episode of “The Horror of Dolores Roach” (Oct. 17). It’s a show with “Sweeney Todd” elements that also draws in threads about gentrification and racist policing, and it was so absorbing that I missed my turn by three blocks. “Adventures In New America” — created and written by the filmmaker Stephen Winter and his longtime collaborator Tristan Cowen, and produced by Night Vale Presents — is set in a new nation formed after an unidentified cataclysmic event. New America is a lot like old America. It’s brimming with bizarre patriotic displays. It’s going through a poke bowl craze. Every social interaction brings a heady mix of performative wokeness and racist microaggression. It’s kind of like America 2: More American. Or as Mr. Cowen puts it: “The dystopian future is our present.” Meanwhile, a mysterious new race has arrived, known in the show as Tetchy Terrorist Vampire Zombies from outer space. The zombies are both extremely racist and highly sensitive about their own identities — the various supernatural labels attached to them in New America are, to their mind, not very P.C. In absurdist landscape, we latch onto IA, an appealing loner voiced by Mr. Winter. In Episode 1 we follow him as he learns he has an operable brain tumor, falls through every loophole of the New American health care system, and discovers that the only way to finance the procedure and save his life is to get arrested and avail himself of the free services of the prison hospital. IA is black, so this should not be too hard, and yet it proves absurdly impossible: When he tries to persuade a police officer to pick him up for blatant shoplifting, the cop is insulted: “You telling me how to do my job?” "
1665,"President Trump rejected the official estimate from the Puerto Rico government that nearly 3,000 people died from Hurricane Maria through a series of misleading or false claims on Thursday. He cited an outdated tally that officials had acknowledged almost immediately was too low, misleadingly suggested that doubt over the tally did not emerge until “a long time later,” accused Democrats, without evidence, of inflating the figures and wrongly described the current official estimate as counting all deaths on the island, regardless of whether they were related to the storm. The 3,000 figure comes from an estimate in a study by independent researchers at George Washington University and commissioned by the Puerto Rico government. The researchers found that government data documented 16,608 deaths from September 2017 to February 2018 — 2,975 more deaths than under predicted mortality rates. In other words, researchers explicitly tried to avoid counting people who “died for any reason, like old age.”  Hours after the study was released in late August, the government of Puerto Rico revised its estimated death toll to 2,975 people. "
1666,"The journalist, whose new book is “Fear: Trump in the White House,” remembers reading “The Swiss Family Robinson” as a child: “It was, I believe, the first time I dropped out of my own world into another for a sustained period of time.” What books are on your nightstand? My nightstand is crowded. It holds books I’ve recently read, partially read, am waiting to read, and occasionally consult: “The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr,” Ken Gormley’s exhaustive study of the controversial and historic Whitewater and Lewinsky investigation by special counsel Kenneth W. Starr; “The Line of Fire,” a memoir by Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. (written with David Chanoff), the underappreciated chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Reagan, who took bold and secret steps to avoid accidental war with the Soviet Union; “Alfred Kazin’s Journals,” by the postwar intellectual and great literary critic, edited by Richard M. Cook; “Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar,” the biography by Simon Sebag Montefiore that holds little back about Soviet brutality; “Traps,” MacKenzie Bezos’ novel on the struggles of four modern women; “Genius,” short essays by Harold Bloom on 100 creative writers from Tolstoy to Henry James; the galleys of Steve Luxenberg’s forthcoming book “Separate: The Story of Plessy v. Ferguson, and America’s Journey From Slavery to Segregation,” to be published in February; “Once an Eagle,” Anton Myrer’s massive 1968 novel of 20th-century war; “All the King’s Men,” Robert Penn Warren’s epic 1946 novel about a cynical populist Southern governor in the 1930s narrated by a former reporter (my first read in college helped draw me to journalism); “Crossing to Safety,” Wallace Stegner’s 1987 novel showing the lasting power of long-term friendships between two couples in academia; “Cutting for Stone,” Abraham Verghese’s 2009 novel on empathy as a necessary force in the practice of medicine and life; and, lastly and valuably, “Muscle Pain Relief in 90 Seconds,” by Dr. Dale L. Anderson. What’s the last great book you read (or reread)? This summer I reread “Night of Camp David,” the 1965 novel by Fletcher Knebel (co-author of “Seven Days in May”). A United States president is thought to be mentally unbalanced; the book ends with some compelling twists. Favorite recent great read? “The Other Woman,” by Daniel Silva. A classic international spy mole hunt — cerebral and muscular. What do you read when working on a book? Favorite and familiar John le Carré spy novels — especially “Smiley’s People.” What’s the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently? I was reminded how poisonous and unhappy a life of intolerance and score-settling can be by John A. Farrell’s excellent and penetrating 737-page biography, “Richard Nixon: The Life.” As Nixon said in his farewell address the day he resigned, “Always remember, others may hate you, but those who hate you don’t win unless you hate them, and then you destroy yourself.” "
1667,"SAN FRANCISCO — They erected a mini oil rig, locked arms through oil drums and sat down on the street. “Keep it in the ground,” their banners read. “No more fossil fuels,” they chanted. Protesters gathered at the Global Climate Action Summit on Thursday morning as mayors, ministers, environmentalists and corporate executives poured into the Moscone Center conference hall. By 9:30 a.m., only one entrance was open, and a long line spooled out at another entrance, tightly guarded by the police. The message of the protesters, who were mostly peaceful, was mainly directed at the California governor, Jerry Brown, calling on him to stop oil drilling in the state and protect residents who live close to oil facilities. Cesar Aguirre, 24, a community organizer from Kern County in central California, said his neighbors suffered the health effects of oil wells and refineries. “They see the dirty air,” he said. “They know it’s getting hotter and hotter. They know what’s causing it.” Governor Brown, who spearheaded the conference, bristled at the suggestion that he was too lenient on fossil fuel companies. “I would say without a doubt, California has the most aggressive green energy plans in the Western Hemisphere,” he told a group of reporters inside. “We’re doing a hell of a lot.” In the morning, conference attendees circled the block trying to find ways to get inside the convention center. Some shrugged at the inconvenience. Others commended the protesters for putting pressure on the leaders inside. “The message that I hope comes across is that you have citizens who care about climate change,” said Katie Walsh of CDP, a nongovernmental group that helps companies and others measure their carbon impact. Another delegate, Deborah Knuckey, who described herself as an activist, called the protest “counterproductive.” The Associated Press and local television stations estimated the crowd at several hundred people. The protests were over by midday. Governor Brown this month signed a law prohibiting the construction of new pipelines to bring in offshore oil and gas, in a move aimed at blocking efforts by the Trump administration to open most federal waters to offshore oil and gas drilling. Mr. Brown wasn’t the only target, though. At one point, inside the conference, protesters interrupted remarks by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, shouting “the air is not for sale,” according to a report by Bloomberg News. “Only in America could you have environmentalists protesting an environmental conference,” he said. Brad Plumer contributed reporting. "
1668,"After it was forced to retreat from an effort to make challenging labor practices harder in many workplaces, the National Labor Relations Board is moving to achieve the goal through other means. The board announced on Thursday that it was set to publish a proposed rule redefining a company’s responsibility under labor law for workers engaged at arm’s length, such as those hired by contractors or franchisees. The proposal, reversing an action taken during the Obama administration, would make it less likely that a company in such a situation would be deemed a joint employer liable for labor abuses like firing workers seeking to unionize. In February, a majority on the board voted to vacate its earlier attempt to change the policy, in a decision involving a company called Hy-Brand, after the agency’s inspector general concluded that one of the board members appeared to have had a conflict of interest and should have recused himself. But the board has authority to change policy both by deciding cases and by putting forth rules. Having been stymied in its initial approach, it has decided to rely on another. Philip A. Miscimarra, who was chairman of the board when it issued the Hy-Brand decision, said that rulemaking was justified and that the task was urgent because the current policy had created uncertainty among employers, workers and unions. “The agency has to fix it,” Mr. Miscimarra, who was elevated to chairman by President Trump, said in an interview this year. Mr. Miscimarra left the board when his term expired at the end of 2017. "
1669,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Rains from Hurricane Florence lashed the Carolina coast, with the storm growing in size and packing sustained winds of up to 100 miles an hour. The National Hurricane Center said the storm was likely to maintain its intensity until the eye made landfall early Friday. The storm is forecast to crawl inland, drenching a wide area with extremely heavy rains, up to 40 inches in some parts. The Times is providing unlimited access to coverage of the storm for all readers. Keep up with the latest here, and look at the full range of coverage here. In Southeast Asia, millions are bracing for Typhoon Mangkhut, a strong storm that could reach the Philippines by Friday.

1670,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. If you live in New York, you have until 9 p.m. to vote in the primary. Find your polling station here, and see live results here tonight. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] As I wrote on Day 1 of “On Politics,” we won’t be all-Trump-all-the-time, obsessing over each bit of noise. But sometimes, the president will say or do something that is worthy of … deeper review. Today is that day. As emergency responders braced for Hurricane Florence, President Trump decided to spend time disputing the death toll from another catastrophic storm. Mr. Trump stated (on Twitter, naturally) that 6 to 18 people died from Hurricane Maria last year, rejecting the Puerto Rican government analysis that the storm killed nearly 3,000. He blamed Democrats for padding the death toll “in order to make me look as bad as possible.” As we’ve seen, if Mr. Trump feels his record is being attacked, he hits back ten times harder. But there are exaggerations, distortions and false statements. Erasing thousands of tragic deaths falls into another category entirely. It’s really hard to assess the number of people who die from a storm that has a devastating impact on fundamental needs like water, electricity and medical care. If a bedridden person on a respirator dies because there’s no power for their machine, is that a storm-related death? "
1671,"Acknowledging that the separation of migrant families along the southwest border may have compromised their right to seek asylum, the federal government has agreed to allow a second chance for up to 1,000 migrants who had been facing deportation. In a settlement announced Thursday, lawyers for the government said that parents whose children were taken from them under the administration’s “zero-tolerance” border enforcement policy will again be able to make a case for asylum. They can also remain in the United States while their children pursue their own asylum cases. Lawyers for immigrants challenging the thousands of family separations carried out along the border this spring had argued that losing their children had left parents too distraught to adequately make a case for asylum status. The asylum process can be grueling, often requiring lengthy interviews and documentary evidence. As a result, the lawyers said, many of the parents’ claims had been speedily denied. “It’s an implicit recognition that they did wrong by these families in denying them meaningful access to the asylum system, and that wrong is now going to be made right,” said Simon Y. Sandoval-Moshenberg, legal director of the Immigrant Advocacy Program at the Legal Aid Justice Center, who represented the plaintiffs. The Trump administration stopped separating families along the border in June, but by then, thousands of children had been taken from their parents under the “zero tolerance” policy, under which the government sought to criminally prosecute all migrants who entered the United States without permission. Since then, families that were separated under the policy have launched an onslaught of legal challenges over how it affected their legal rights and emotional well-being. This latest settlement, filed late Wednesday, applies to three of the ongoing cases that have been consolidated under Judge Dana M. Sabraw in San Diego. "
1672,"This week on the right-wing site Breitbart News, a video surfaced of one of Google’s weekly “T.G.I.F.” meetings, where employees and the leadership engage in heated debates over everything from healthier snack stations to the election of Donald Trump. Breitbart News described the 2016 video as a “smoking gun” because it showed Sergey Brin, the Google co-founder, telling everyone how he felt about the new leader of the free world. Spoiler: Not good. “Myself, as an immigrant, as a refugee, I certainly find this election deeply offensive, and I know many of you do, too,” he said in his flat, nasal voice. He was obviously rattled, as were the other top Google executives on stage with him. “I think it’s a very stressful time, and it conflicts with many of our values.” Conservatives who have been spreading the canard that social media companies oppress their views — a drum Mr. Trump has himself been banging on lately — seized on the video as proof of Google’s bias. But it should not have shocked anyone to find that Mr. Brin, a Russian exile who built the quirkiest of companies on the planet, is no fan of the president. Responding to the attack on its motives, a Google spokeswoman said, “Nothing was said at that meeting, or any other meeting, to suggest that any political bias ever influences the way we build or operate our products.” "
1673,"Sol Wachtler, a former chief judge of the New York State Court of Appeals, once famously remarked that grand juries were so easily swayed that they would “indict a ham sandwich” if a prosecutor requested it. Many times, there is truth to this. But an indictment does not end the process of determining guilt or innocence. It begins it. Following indictment, criminal defendants can question the validity of the charges, the methods used to acquire the evidence and the evidence itself. They can seek to dismiss a criminal indictment and, if unsatisfied with the ruling, appeal it all the way to the Supreme Court. The grand jury system has been employed in hundreds of thousands of cases involving all manner of crimes committed by all manner of people. All, that is, except one: the president. No grand jury has ever indicted a president, and consequently no court, let alone the Supreme Court, has ruled on the critical question of whether the Constitution allows a president to be indicted while in office. Legal scholars have opined on both sides of the issue, and Department of Justice attorneys have drafted memorandums arguing against indicting a sitting president. But none of these analyses establish definitive rules of law. It is time to clarify the issue. Provided there is sufficient evidence to support an indictment of President Trump — and there are many indications that there is — the special counsel, Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible Russian interference in the 2016 election, and prosecutors from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, who are investigating payments to my client, Stormy Daniels, and Karen McDougal, should present their evidence to grand juries. Those jurors, citizens of our communities, should then determine whether the evidence supports an indictment of Mr. Trump. The fact that Mr. Trump is a sitting president should not derail a process that applies to all Americans, regardless of stature or station. He would still have the post-indictment relief available to all citizens, including the ability to challenge the constitutionality of the indictment. Some also argue that indicting the president would critically impair his ability to lead the country. But this is a White House already engulfed in chaos and daily distractions. And if the House were to initiate impeachment proceedings, it is hard to see how that process would be any less distracting than a criminal indictment. "

The Farewell Tour
By Chris Hedges
388 pp. Simon & Schuster. $27. Chris Hedges is a bundle of contradictions and so too is his new book, “America: The Farewell Tour.” As a New York Times reporter covering the Middle East, Hedges won praise from all quarters. The conservative Christopher Caldwell wrote in a 2002 review of an earlier Hedges book, “War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning,” that Hedges “has proved a correspondent of unusual bravery, stubbornness and independence. By going AWOL from the U.S. military’s press pool during the gulf war, he became one of the few eyewitnesses to American-Iraqi gunfights. He was among the rare big-time reporters to cover the Kosovo War as a war and not a morality play. His remorseless chronicling of the criminality and thuggery of our allies in the Kosovo Liberation Army is one of the high points of post-Vietnam War journalism.” At the same time, Caldwell was on to a problem: Hedges’ “tone is often marked by an argument-foreclosing condescension.” “Is this moral reflection,” Caldwell asked, “or moralistic preening?” In his current book, Hedges raises provocative questions. Has the destructive aspect of capitalism reached a tipping point? Are drug abuse, pornography and gambling emblematic of a free market run amok? Are the vacant shells of cities like Scranton, Dayton, Buffalo, Youngstown and Cleveland the inevitable consequences of an economy based on greed? Hedges’ answer consists of a grim doubling down. “The American Empire is coming to an end,” he writes. “The death spiral appears unstoppable, meaning the United States as we know it will no longer exist within a decade or, at most, two.” "
1675,"WASHINGTON — It was the summer of 1986, and Paul Manafort, then a top-tier Washington lobbyist, counted no fewer than 10 foreign governments and political groups as clients. He directed American media campaigns for them, met with officials in the White House, State Department and Congress on their behalf and strategized about how to sway United States policy toward their interests. What he did not do was disclose much of his activity to the Justice Department, as required by the Foreign Agents Registration Act, the law governing lobbying for foreign interests. Federal investigators confronted him about those omissions, ordered him to correct his filings and warned him not to repeat the same mistakes. Thirty-two years later, Mr. Manafort’s undisclosed work for foreigners is in investigators’ cross hairs again. This time, they are being far less forgiving. In a criminal trial scheduled to begin Monday, federal prosecutors planned to argue that for nine years starting in 2005, Mr. Manafort ran a lobbying campaign in Washington on behalf of pro-Russia political forces in Ukraine without disclosing his activities to the Justice Department as required. When confronted, the indictment alleges, he lied to department officials. If a jury agrees, those crimes could substantially add to prison time Mr. Manafort already faces from his conviction on  bank and tax fraud charges by a federal jury in Northern Virginia last month. He also faces charges of obstruction of justice and money laundering, but hiding and lying about his lobbying work is at the heart of the indictment. "
1676,"WASHINGTON — The senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee referred information involving Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court, to federal investigators on Thursday, but the senator declined to make public what the matter involved. Two officials familiar with the matter say the incident involved possible sexual misconduct between Judge Kavanaugh and a woman when they were both in high school. They spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss the matter. The statement by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California came a week before the Judiciary Committee is to vote on his nomination. “I have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court,” Ms. Feinstein said in a statement. “That individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision. I have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities.” The information came in July in a letter, which was first sent to the office of Representative Anna Eshoo, Democrat of California, and accuses the judge of sexual misconduct toward the letter’s author, a person familiar with the letter confirmed. Ms. Feinstein, who received the letter from Ms. Eshoo’s office, informed fellow Democrats on the Judiciary Committee about its existence and its contents on Wednesday evening but did not share the letter itself. Several Democrats advised her to take its claims to the F.B.I., and others pressed for it to become public. In addition to criminal investigations, the F.B.I. conducts background checks on all major government appointees, including Supreme Court nominees. The F.B.I. said in a statement on Thursday that it had received Ms. Feinstein’s referral and included it in Judge Kavanaugh’s background file. A bureau official also said that no criminal investigation had been opened related to the matter. "
1677,"THE HAGUE — In a city that symbolizes international peace and justice, the ambassador from Burundi has had a lonely job. As her government faces accusations of murder, rape and torture, she has made the unpopular argument that the International Criminal Court should butt out. The ambassador, Vestine Nahimana, says the court is a politicized, unchecked intrusion on Burundi’s sovereignty. “It’s difficult,” Ms. Nahimana said in an interview here. “In a way, we’ve been isolated.” No longer. Her critiques echo those of warlords and despots whose arguments have long been dismissed by the West. But Burundi’s position got a powerful voice of support this week from President Trump, whose national security adviser, John R. Bolton, declared the international court “ineffective, unaccountable, and indeed, outright dangerous,” and threatened sanctions against the court’s prosecutors and judges who pursued cases against Americans. “We can only rejoice that another country has seen the same wrong,” Ms. Nahimana said. “Perhaps this will be a message that the sovereignty of a country must be respected, in the U.S. and in other countries. That’s also what the White House asks.” For the Trump administration, Mr. Bolton’s speech was the latest example of disdain for global organizations and — in this case — taking the same side as strongmen and dictators. But for the International Criminal Court, a relatively young institution, the new White House policy of open hostility comes at a perilous time. The court, which opened in 2002, was envisioned as the world’s permanent judicial body for cases of war crimes, genocide and other crimes against humanity. But a former prosecutor has faced accusations of corruption, and the court’s record has been spotty. Only eight people have been convicted and other cases have collapsed or been withdrawn. The most significant conviction, the war-crimes case against the former Congolese vice president Jean-Pierre Bemba, was overturned because of legal errors. "
1678,"The Balkans remains in strategic limbo. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia 10 years ago, but Serbia has yet to come to terms with its loss — refusing to recognize Kosovo and stirring trouble between the country’s ethnic Serbs and the ethnic Albanian majority. Almost two decades after the NATO bombing campaign to drive Yugoslav forces from Kosovo, some 4,000 NATO troops remain there to keep the peace. A breakthrough may now be in the making. It is a morally offensive one, but nonetheless the United States and the European Union should get behind it. President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia and President Hashim Thaci of Kosovo are apparently working on a proposal to engage in a land swap that could bring the simmering conflict to an end. Northern Kosovo, which is populated mainly by ethnic Serbs and borders Serbia, would be transferred to Serbia. In return, a to-be-determined chunk of Serbia’s Presevo Valley, which is heavily populated by ethnic Albanians and borders Kosovo, would become part of Kosovo. This swap is effectively a peaceful form of ethnic cleansing. Still, it is the right thing to do. Pragmatism needs to trump principle in this case to secure a deal that promises to bring a close to the years of bloodshed and border changes that have resulted from the collapse of Yugoslavia. The proposed land swap has been lurking in the background since the early days of Kosovo’s independence. But it has gone nowhere in part because the United States and the European Union have adamantly opposed it. True to form, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany recently said that “the territorial integrity of the states of the Western Balkans has been established and is inviolable.” Backing up Ms. Merkel, dozens of prominent scholars and policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic have signed an open letter condemning the proposal and imploring the United States and the European Union to oppose “a return to ethnification of polities and frontiers.” "
1679,"With just under two months until the midterms, the races that seem likely to decide control of Congress remain strikingly close, according to a first wave of New York Times Upshot/Siena College polls. To take over the House, Democrats need to wrest at least 23 individual districts from Republican control. We’ve started surveying dozens of the most competitive districts and have finished polls in nine: seven tossup districts and two districts that lean Republican, according to the Cook Political Report. In the seven tossup races, the result was within one point in five of them, though Democrats claimed a nine-point lead in Minnesota’s Third, where the incumbent, Erik Paulsen, trailed the Democrat, Dean Phillips, 51 percent to 42 percent. Republicans had an eight-point polling lead in each of the two races thought to lean Republican. A close race in these contests is no surprise. Indeed, we asked Dave Wasserman of the Cook Political Report for his expected results in these races, before we conducted the survey. On average, neither the Democrats nor the Republicans did better than expected. The Cook Political Report characterizes the Democrats as “substantial favorites to win control.” Still, at this stage, there’s little hard evidence indicating that either party has claimed a clear and consistent edge. "
1680,"WASHINGTON — The presidential playbook during times of disaster is pretty well established by now: Consult with emergency officials (and be seen doing so). Express concern for those affected (on camera). Assure the public that the government is ready for whatever comes (whether it is or not). But once again, President Trump has rewritten the playbook as Hurricane Florence blows through the Carolinas. While delivering forceful messages of warning and reassurance, Mr. Trump has also been busy awarding himself good grades for past hurricanes and even accusing opponents of inventing a death toll “to make me look as bad as possible.” At a time when even Mr. Trump acknowledged that the focus should be on millions of Americans in the path of the storm, the always-about-me president could not restrain himself for long. Angry at criticism of his response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year, he denied on Thursday that nearly 3,000 people had died, falsely calling it a made-up number by Democrats out to get him. [Fact Check: Democrats had nothing to do with the increase in the death toll in Puerto Rico.] His defiant rejection of the widely accepted count infuriated the island’s leadership and even some Republican leaders in Congress. But it was hardly the first time Mr. Trump has dismissed consensus facts that do not fit his narrative. Mr. Trump’s version of his presidency is one of unmatched, best-in-history victory after victory, never mind what history may say. What the people of Puerto Rico considered a calamity, he saw as an “incredible unsung success.” “He pushes back against the data on deaths, not because he’s upset by the loss of nearly 3,000 lives but because he’s terrified of responsibility, failure and blame,” said Michael D’Antonio, a Trump biographer. “Were someone else president, Trump would be the first to tweet an attack on an administration that struggled the way his did after Maria. Now he imagines that others will attack him, so he’s acting first.” Ever since the storm, Mr. Trump has pushed back against criticism that his administration was slow to respond to Puerto Rico, where the distribution of supplies, gas and food lagged and power outages lasted for months, particularly compared with a swift and efficient response to an earlier hurricane that hit Texas. It was six days after Hurricane Maria hit the island before Mr. Trump pledged to go there, even as he traveled to Texas four days after Hurricane Harvey made landfall. Full power was  restored to homes only in August, nearly a year after the storm. "
1681,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Apple threw its annual iPhone bonanza at the company’s sleek $179 million Steve Jobs Theater, adjacent to its new spaceship campus in Cupertino. The event is Apple’s chance to show off new iPhones that are typically faster, bigger — and more expensive. Indeed, the company followed its usual playbook: Its new phones are faster, bigger and more expensive. The new entry-level phone, the iPhone XR, starts at $750 while the iPhone XS Max, its biggest, most powerful iPhone yet, costs $1,450 with all the bells and whistles. (Yes, the iPhones’ names are getting more confusing: The new flagship iPhone XS is not pronounced “iPhone Excess,” but rather “iPhone Tennis.”) Apple also unveiled a new Apple Watch that comes with an F.D.A.-approved electronic heart monitor, which could prove to have big implications for health care — and the device’s sales. Over all, the event is a dog-and-pony show for Apple to show off its technological advances. While many of the biggest tech companies now hold major annual conferences and product launches, there is nothing like an Apple event in the world of business. There were fancy finger sandwiches, a cheering audience and a few celebrities. What were the actor Jon Hamm and the model Karlie Kloss doing at the event? Good question. I spotted President Barack Obama’s presidential photographer, Pete Souza, signing a book for a fan. Also sighted: Marissa Mayer, the former chief executive of Yahoo, who hasn’t been spotted as frequently around Silicon Valley since she helped sell the internet pioneer to Verizon last year. [Read more here about how Apple is now evolving its smart watch into a clearly health-related device.] "
1682,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. There isn’t a lot of good news coming out of the federal government these days. But we got some yesterday. The Food and Drug Administration announced it was cracking down on the epidemic of electronic-cigarette use by teenagers. The agency took a range of actions against manufacturers and retailers to reduce youth e-cigarette use and threatened to do more in the coming months. It’s about time. The rise of electronic cigarettes has always brought one huge potential benefit and one huge downside. If every adult smoker of traditional cigarettes switched to the electronic form, the public-health benefits would be enormous since e-cigarettes are much less damaging. Yet they are still damaging. They contain nicotine and are addictive. They have the potential to increase diabetes and lung disease, impair brain development and encourage other forms of drug addiction, as John Ross of Harvard Medical School explains. The worst thing about e-cigarettes is that they appeal to young people who otherwise probably wouldn’t have taken up smoking. This isn’t an easy area for regulators to get right. Cracking down too aggressively on e-cigarettes may lead to more smoking — including among the young. Going too easy on e-cigarettes may create a new generation of nicotine addicts. "
1683,"When it comes to the last presidential election, the past is still not over. That much is clear in “American Chaos,” a documentary whose maker caught a whiff of Donald J. Trump’s early momentum and set out to interview some of his supporters in the months before Nov. 8, 2016. That filmmaker, James D. Stern, was perplexed by a growing number of people backing Mr. Trump. Camera in hand, he spoke with Cuban immigrants in Florida, coal miners in West Virginia, a rancher in Arizona and others, at least one of whom said he twice voted for Barack Obama. Mr. Stern attended the Republican National Convention, and returned to Florida for election night. It was a prescient plan. Mr. Stern, a longtime Democrat, vowed to listen closely, and he seems to have kept his word. Though he doesn’t mask his expressions — usually astounded, though never mocking — he’s a genial interviewer, empathic, he says, even if he can’t be sympathetic. Most frequently, his interviewees voice disdain for a system they feel isn’t working for them. If, like Mr. Stern, you can’t fathom voting as they did, it’s possible to at least understand some of their emotions. (Though perhaps not those people whom we hear denying the facts of climate change, or those whose hatred of Hillary Clinton veers toward the pathological.) Ultimately, “American Chaos” does little more than recap what’s already been said over the past two years. Yet like “11/8/16,” another recent documentary about the election, it gives a voice to many who are routinely ignored. “Passion beats pragmatism,” Mr. Stern says, summing up what he sees on his travels. Indeed, the message here is the same for both sides, for elections to come: Those who harness that passion gain the power. "
1684,"So it’s all over but the voting. I’m writing this column on the assumption that Judge Brett Kavanaugh will soon be Justice Kavanaugh, despite the Democrats’ continuing efforts to convert a futile battle over ideology into an ugly one over transparency and ethics. By the first Monday in October or soon thereafter, the Roberts court version 5.0 (accounting for the earlier arrival of Justices Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch since Chief Justice John Roberts took his seat in September 2005) will be underway. What then? Most answers to the “What then?” question have offered side-by-side comparisons of Brett Kavanaugh and the justice he will be succeeding, Anthony Kennedy. What part of Justice Kennedy’s 30-year legacy will he embrace? What part will he repudiate? I’d like to shift the field of vision and consider the impact of Judge Kavanaugh’s arrival on the eight other justices — on the dynamic of the Supreme Court as a whole. Justice Byron White, who saw 13 new justices take their seats during his own 31-year tenure, once remarked that every time a new justice joins the court, “it’s a different court.” On one level, that’s a truism: In a group of people as small as nine, it’s hardly a surprise that the departure of one and arrival of another would alter some established patterns, even beyond a measurable shift in the group’s ideological midpoint. But it seems to me that Justice Kennedy’s departure and his replacement by a justice reliably to his right could well be transformative, and not just because the right to abortion may lose its tenuous hold or because the sun may finally set on affirmative action. “Transformative” is a strong word. But consider the sustained impact that Justice Kennedy’s position in the center of the court had on colleagues both to his left and to his right. An odd-numbered court always has a center, of course, a “median justice,” in the language of political science. But Justice Kennedy was not just any median justice, and the court during the 12 years that he occupied that position after Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s retirement was not a typical Supreme Court. "
1685,"Conservatives argue that California’s liberal politics have failed. They point out that by one key measure the state now has the highest poverty rate in the nation and they argue that its liberal minimum wage and restrictive housing codes have more than a hundred thousand people homeless, more than a million unemployed and millions more stuck on the bottom rungs of the socioeconomic ladder. Liberals see a dynamic California where wealth generated by Hollywood and an immigrant-rich high tech industry, in concert with a top university system, has fueled a politically dominant Democratic coalition of Hispanics, Asians, blacks and whites steadily moving millions of people up from where they started. “This is a topsy-turvy debate,” Jonathan Rodden, a political scientist at Stanford, told me by email. “The left celebrates California’s rapid growth while turning a blind eye to its inequality. The right decries poverty and inequality while discounting rapid economic growth.” The dispute raises three basic questions. Does multicultural California, firmly under the political control of the Democratic Party, a state that taxes and spends at higher rates than most of the country, represent the future of the nation? In California, both the sales tax and the tax rate applied to the wealthy are the highest in the nation; per capita state and local spending are the sixth highest. At the same time, the $2.7 trillion California economy is the fifth largest in the world, behind the United States, China, Japan and Germany, but bigger than the United Kingdom or France. Can the contemporary Democratic Party in California fairly address the divergent interests of an exceptionally affluent high-tech elite and a diverse population that is 39.1 percent Hispanic, 37.2 percent white, 15.2 percent Asian and 6.5 percent African-American? Are the huge disparities in income, education, housing and wealth inevitable in a state that is simultaneously home to hugely profitable high-skill industries and a surging minority population, many of them low-skilled immigrants?

1687,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Population levels at federally contracted shelters for young immigrants have shot up more than fivefold since last summer, to the highest level ever recorded, according to data obtained by The Times. There were 12,800 migrant children in custody this month. Some of those who work in the shelter network say bottlenecks are straining both the children and the system that cares for them. In a recent note to Congress, the White House said it intended to pay Mexico $20 million to deport as many as 17,000 people who are in that country illegally. • Separately, government data showed that the foreign-born population in the U.S. had reached its highest share since 1910, with Asians representing the largest group. • As the outer edges of the storm began arriving in the Carolinas, officials warned of fierce winds and flooding ahead, storm surges up to 13 feet and the possibility of widespread power failures.

1688,"The Trump administration has made clear that its top priority in the Middle East is to thwart Iran’s nuclear and regional ambitions. So why is it so reluctant to lift a finger against Tehran’s most audacious gambit in Syria? That gambit is the reconquest, by Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and his Iranian and Russian allies, of Idlib Province, the last major rebel holdout in western Syria and home to about three million people. A humanitarian catastrophe is expected to follow, entailing mass casualties and another tidal wave of refugees. By now, the strategic consequences should also be obvious. Iran will have succeeded in consolidating a Shiite crescent stretching from Bandar Abbas on the Persian Gulf to the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. Russia will have succeeded in reasserting itself as a Mideast military victor and diplomatic power broker. Hezbollah, already the dominant political player in Lebanon, will further extend its influence in Syria. As for Assad, he will have shown that the community of civilized nations will, in fact, let you get away with murder. And with using prohibited chemical weapons. And with decimating your own people by means of barrel bombs, mass torture and food blockades. The losers in this equation: Turkey, already groaning under the pressure of millions of Syrian refugees and a crumbling economy; Israel, whose repeated strikes against Iranian targets in Syria have dented but not denied Tehran’s ambitions; Europe, which could face yet another refugee crisis even as the effects of the last are felt in the resurgence of the far right; and the Syrian people, terrorized witnesses to the marriage of wickedness and indifference. And then there’s the United States, where two administrations have now allowed the Syrian crisis to become depressing testimony to the worthlessness of our word, the fickleness of our friendship and hollowness of our values. Donald Trump, loudly billing himself as Barack Obama’s opposite in every respect, has effectively adopted his predecessor’s worst foreign policy mistake. "
1689,"North Carolina’s coastal communities began feeling the wrath of Hurricane Florence on Thursday, a storm that could be the worst to hit the region in a generation. The assault of wind and rain is expected to last through the weekend and well into next week. The storm is packing powerful winds of up to 90 miles per hour as it approaches the coast, driving a storm surge that could reach 11 feet in places. Inland residents are bracing for rainfall that is being forecast in feet, not inches, with the potential for catastrophic flash flooding. Here are the latest developments: • The center of the storm was about 30 miles east of Wilmington, N.C., at 4 a.m. Friday, with tropical-storm-force winds spreading across the Outer Banks and the southeastern coast of North Carolina. The National Hurricane Center said the storm, which has begun to slow and is now a Category 1 hurricane, was likely to maintain its intensity until its eye made landfall early Friday. • The cloud coverage from the storm, an indication of its size, is as large as the Carolinas. • The storm is forecast to crawl inland, drenching a wide area with extremely heavy rains — 20, 30 or even 40 inches of rainfall are predicted in some spots on the Carolina coast. Places as far inland as Charlotte, about 150 miles from the coast, could receive more than 10 inches of rain. Learn more about why slow-moving hurricanes are so dangerous. • More than 180,000 people are already without power in North Carolina, state officials said, and the number is expected to rise. The major power supplier for North and South Carolina, Duke Energy, warned that up to three million customers across the two states could lose power. • The authorities made last-ditch efforts to get everyone out of harm’s way. In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said about 421,000 state residents had evacuated. But some hurricane holdouts who have never fled a storm were determined to stay. Read why they’re staying put.

1690,"A German theater production that invited audiences in China to voice their complaints about society has been canceled over fears of what they might say. The Schaubühne Berlin company was due to perform “An Enemy of the People,” a 19th-century play by the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, in Nanjing on Thursday and Friday. But the shows were abruptly canceled after members of the audience in Beijing last week shouted criticisms of their authoritarian government. The theater in Nanjing that was to host the play cited “technical problems,” including a hole in the stage, Tobias Veit, the Schaubühne’s executive director, said in a telephone interview. But Mr. Veit said the real reason for the cancellation appeared to be that the theater managers deemed the play, first performed in 1883, too risky given the audience comments in Beijing. “People were saying things like, ‘The biggest problem in China is the question of free speech,’ and things about economic scandals, corruption and how the press is not revealing the truth,” Mr. Veit said. “We thought they might not speak openly, but they did and actually talked about the political and social issues in China.” After that first show on Sept. 6 at the National Center for the Performing Arts, an egg-shaped landmark in central Beijing, the venue’s management called a meeting with Mr. Veit and his colleagues, and asked them to cut the part where the audience is given a chance to voice grievances.

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. As the Eastern Seaboard braced for Hurricane Florence, many late-night hosts said they were worried about President Trump’s ability to respond to the storm. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump was characteristically short on details about his plans. But he did warn that Florence would be “tremendously big and tremendously wet.” Trump added that he thought he had done an excellent job handling Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year, but said that “nobody would understand that.” Noah pushed back, reminding viewers that 3,000 people had died as a result of Maria, and that it took almost a year for power to be restored to parts of the island. On “The Daily Show,” Stephen Colbert said the president’s point about Maria was indeed hard to “understand.” As the debate over Trump’s trade policy continues, Jimmy Kimmel played video from speeches in which the president insisted that American companies hire American workers. Then Kimmel said that seemed hypocritical, given the president’s track record as a business owner.

1692,"Since his appointment 16 months ago as special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III has granted no interviews and held no news conferences. The spokesman for his office is known around Washington as “Mr. No-Comment.” Even public sightings are rare: A photograph of Mr. Mueller at an airport gate, with Donald Trump Jr. in the background, went viral. Silence as a public relations strategy is risky, especially for someone who is impugned almost daily by Fox News pundits, Trump allies like Rudolph W. Giuliani and tweets from the president himself. Supporters fear that the fusillade is eroding public confidence in the special counsel’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election before Mr. Mueller has a chance to present his findings. “The risk you always assume is, if your critics and your opponents are the only ones doing the talking, then they get to write the headlines,” said Kevin Madden, a communications strategist who served as a spokesman for the Justice Department under President George W. Bush. Yet veterans of similar investigations say that keeping quiet may be Mr. Mueller’s only viable option, given the limited set of strategies available for federal prosecutors to communicate with the public. By law, special counsels must follow Justice Department guidelines that restrict them from sharing details about pending investigations, making leaks a potential criminal matter. Liberals have urged Mr. Mueller to fight back against President Trump’s invective, but predecessors who tried to defend themselves in the press have gotten burned. Kenneth W. Starr, the prosecutor who investigated the Clinton White House, gave impromptu news conferences while taking out the garbage at his Virginia home — and ended up disliked by two-thirds of the public by the time he stepped down. “It’s hurtful and painful, but a prosecutor’s job is not to necessarily weigh a P.R. battle against political forces that are throwing everything at him,” said Ken Gormley, the author of books about Mr. Starr and Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor who was fired by President Richard M. Nixon during the “Saturday Night Massacre” in 1973. "
1693,"New York voters head to the polls on Thursday as an unusual season of primaries, marked by surprise victories and insurgent candidacies, moves to an end. Voters will choose their party’s nominees for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and the State Legislature — and there’s more intrigue than normal. The intrigue starts at the top: Can Cynthia Nixon defy the polls and deprive Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of a third nomination? The race for the Democratic nomination for attorney general in New York — a contest to decide who will inherit ongoing lawsuits and inquiries into President Trump — is a tossup, according to the polls. Even the logistics are complicated. New York has a split primary system where federal primaries are held in June but state and local primaries occur in September. This year’s primary is on a Thursday, rather than a Tuesday, because of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish holiday, and the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Finally, check your watches: In much of upstate New York, except for near Buffalo, polls do not open until noon; downstate, polls open at 6 a.m. All sites close at 9 p.m., according to the State Board of Elections. “I cannot remember a primary where there are so many open seats and fascinating questions,” said Jeanne Zaino, a professor of political science at Iona College. “People are in a wait-and-see moment, whereas you usually know how things will go.” Here are five things to look for in Thursday’s primary. "
1694,"WASHINGTON — In July, President Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers declared that the country’s five-decade war on poverty was largely over and called it a success. On Wednesday, the Census Bureau released its 2017 annual report on the poor that offered a stark counterpoint, suggesting that the national recovery has bypassed many of the 40 million to 45 million Americans estimated to be living below the federal poverty level. While median household income rose 1.8 percent last year, the national poverty rate remained stubbornly high at 12.3 percent. That was just a slight decrease from the previous year’s level of 12.7 percent, according to the federal government’s most comprehensive annual gauge of economic hardship. The supplemental poverty measure for 2017, widely regarded by economists as more accurate, was even higher, 13.9 percent in 2017, essentially unchanged from the year before. That is an improvement from the recent high of 16 percent recorded in 2013. But economists and advocates for poor people say the relatively modest gains over the last few years are fragile, endangered by the Trump administration’s policies and vulnerable to a long-overdue economic downturn. “If this is the best we can do, it isn’t good,” said Timothy Smeeding, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies poverty and economic mobility. “Things really tapered off this year, after a serious drop in previous years,” he said. “In terms of the boom, the party has lasted a long time, a lot longer than we thought, but not everybody is getting invited — people who are working several jobs, taking jobs without benefits, kids who are growing up in poverty. The fruits of the recovery are not being spread around evenly.” "
1695,"WASHINGTON — When President Trump doled out A-pluses to his administration for hurricane response, declaring the government “totally prepared” to deal with a potentially devastating storm this week, it fell to a little-known adviser standing just to his left in the Oval Office to give a more somber assessment. “Let’s set the expectations,” said Brock Long, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, warning that Hurricane Florence could be “very devastating.” Gesturing at a weather chart and speaking with a distinct southern drawl, he predicted weeks of power failures, flooding and displacement from homes, a somber warning about a storm that Mr. Trump had just referred to, almost admiringly, as a “tremendously large and tremendously wet” event. As the storm has begun lashing the East Coast, Mr. Long, 43, a plain-spoken hurricane expert and emergency management veteran, has become the face of a high-stakes effort by Mr. Trump to cope with a potentially devastating natural disaster, and in the process, to repair the political damage from a much-criticized response to last year’s hurricane season that raised questions about his administration’s competence. The assignment has a personal dimension for Mr. Long, who was born in North Carolina and recalls the day in 1989 when Hurricane Hugo swept over his home — he was 14 at the time — felling trees and buildings. “We were out of power for 10 days, I was out of school, I remember, for two weeks,” Mr. Long, wearing a navy-blue collared shirt emblazoned with the FEMA logo, told CBS on Tuesday. “This storm is setting up to be very similar to that one.” But it is a particularly steep challenge for Mr. Long, whose agency has acknowledged shortcomings in its response last year to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, where nearly 3,000 deaths were eventually attributed to the storm. Mr. Trump has fanned the flames of controversy over that episode as Hurricane Florence approaches, disputing the death toll and charging that Democrats had inflated the number for political reasons. "
1696,"WASHINGTON — For years, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have fought regulators in Europe on privacy, antitrust and taxes. In the United States, the tech titans were on friendly terrain. But on Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission kicked off a series of hearings to discuss whether the agency’s competition and consumer protection policies should change to better reflect new technologies and companies. Joseph J. Simons, the agency’s chairman, expressed openness to a new approach. “The broad antitrust consensus that has existed within the antitrust community, in relatively stable form for the last 25 years, is being challenged,” Mr. Simons said. “I approach all these issues with a very open mind, very much willing to be influenced by what we see and hear at these hearings.” The F.T.C. hearings, the first of 15 to 20 over the next several months, are one of several efforts underway on the federal and state level that threaten to limit the expansion and power of tech companies. Later this month, Congress will bring executives from top tech companies to testify on proposals for privacy laws. The Justice Department has warned it may start investigations into whether Google and other social media sites are biased against conservative voices. The spotlight on the giants of Silicon Valley is a major shift for regulators in the United States. For years, they held up the growth of these firms as an emblem of American business leadership and ingenuity. But after a string of crises over privacy and misinformation on social media, a growing chorus of regulators from both political parties is casting a more skeptical eye on the industry. New regulations in the United States are unlikely to arrive anytime soon, and any new federal policies will probably be weaker than those in Europe and states like California. Tech companies have lobbied the Trump administration for voluntary rules and government officials have indicated their desire for light-touch regulation that would pre-empt some state laws. "
1697,"A federal judge will rule Friday on how to address an improper decision by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to freeze a plan to help student loan borrowers who were cheated by their schools. A new Education Department rule would have sped up and expanded a system for erasing the federal loan debts of students at schools that broke state laws and misled their attendees. It may now be revived: Judge Randolph D. Moss, a federal judge in Washington, said Wednesday that the department’s move to postpone the rule just weeks before its start date last year was “arbitrary and capricious.” The ruling was a victory for attorneys general from 18 states and the District of Columbia, who filed a lawsuit last year challenging the Education Department’s decision. “It’s time for this rule to go into effect and give thousands of students the relief they’ve been waiting for,” said Maura Healey, the Massachusetts attorney general, who led the multistate coalition opposing the delay. The Education Department is reviewing the ruling, said Liz Hill, a spokeswoman. Judge Moss’s decision may lead to changes in how the government handles tens of thousands of existing claims from students seeking to have their loans discharged. But any remedies he orders may soon be blunted: The Education Department is working to completely revise its system for handling future requests. Even so, the ruling was the latest in a series of judicial rebukes to the Trump administration for trying to shortcut the government’s formal process for adopting and eliminating agency rules. Judges have rejected attempts by multiple agencies to eliminate or indefinitely suspend rules they disliked, including new restrictions on methane emissions from oil and gas wells and an immigration pathway for entrepreneurs running technology start-ups. "
1698,"In her new memoir, “Full Disclosure,” Stormy Daniels cites a statement that President Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, asked her to sign, denying that she had a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. “If indeed I did have a relationship with Donald Trump,” the statement read, “trust me, you wouldn’t be reading about it in the news, you would be reading about it in my book.” Ms. Daniels, a pornographic actress and director whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, later alleged that the statement she was told to sign was false. She maintains that she did have an affair with Mr. Trump, and was threatened into silence. But it was true in one respect. People will soon be reading about it in her book. “Full Disclosure,” which St. Martin’s Press will publish on Oct. 2, contains few new bombshells, but it is likely to rattle the White House nonetheless. In the memoir, Ms. Clifford gives a vivid, detailed account of her encounter with Mr. Trump in 2006 and its aftermath. Her book comes out just weeks before the November midterm elections, potentially bringing her story back into the headlines as Democrats and Republicans fight over control of Congress. The news media has covered Ms. Clifford’s story heavily for the better part of 2018, since the news that Mr. Cohen paid her hush money first broke toward the start of the year. What began as a tale about money paid to silence a porn star alleging an affair with a major presidential candidate went on to become a full-fledged campaign finance scandal. Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty last month to illegally paying Ms. Clifford — far in excess of the legal donation limits — to protect Mr. Trump’s election prospects, saying he was acting at Mr. Trump’s direction. The book does not add many new details to the basic facts of the legal case, though Ms. Clifford does raise questions about efforts to shut down the publication of her story after she made arrangements to sell it to In Touch magazine in 2011. Mr. Trump was also contemplating a presidential run that year. "
1699,"The Trump administration seems confident that consumers will not feel pain from its escalating trade war with China. “Because it’s spread over thousands and thousands of products, nobody’s going to actually notice it at the end of the day,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC on Tuesday, when asked about the administration’s latest round of tariffs on Chinese imports. But a pain-free trade war with China is nearly impossible. For American consumers, prices have already risen on some products that the administration targeted for tariffs this year — most notably, washing machines, which were subjected to steep tariffs in January. It is true, as Mr. Ross noted earlier in his CNBC interview, that the administration has thus far devised such tariffs to minimize sticker shock on retail store shelves for American customers. The list of imports set to be “tariffed,” as President Trump proclaimed on Monday, still does not include T-shirts, smartphones or many other popular products that American stores import from China. The $200 billion list unveiled on Monday will start with a tax of 10 percent and rise to 25 percent in the New Year, a move that should mute the effect of this round of tariffs on holiday shoppers. Next year, though, those products will almost certainly grow noticeably more expensive. China has already vowed to retaliate, raising the possibility that Mr. Trump will announce, as soon as this week, that he plans to impose tariffs on another $267 billion in Chinese imports — basically, everything Americans buy from their largest trading partner. “China has been taking advantage of the United States for a long time, and that's not happening anymore,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference on Tuesday. “We can't let that happen.” Tariffs are ultimately a tax on businesses and consumers, and with each new round, the administration is bringing them closer to home for the typical American. "
1700,"Republicans seem determined to brand themselves the party of sexual harassment and abuse. This is not to pass judgment on whether the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were in high school, as she has said. That has yet to be investigated. Neither is this to suggest that Republican and conservative men are more inclined to behave like entitled pigs than are Democrats and liberals. Abuse of power is nonpartisan. Roughly, for every Blake Farenthold there is a John Conyers Jr.; for every Roger Ailes, a Harvey Weinstein. But when you look beyond the individual bad actors to the way the political teams are responding to episodes of abuse and harassment in the #MeToo era, the contrast is stark. Last year, Al Franken, a Democrat, was run out of the Senate by members of his own conference over behavior that, while stupid and offensive, was bush league compared with the accusations leveled at the Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama. Far from turning against Mr. Moore, who was credibly accused of having molested teenage girls, the Republican establishment stuck by him, smeared his accusers and still funded his campaign — led by none other than President Trump himself. In July, when Representative Jim Jordan faced multiple accusations of having overlooked the sexual abuse of college wrestlers while he was an assistant coach at Ohio State University, Republican lawmakers rushed not merely to defend their colleague but to tear down his accusers. Mr. Trump’s by now predictable response: “I don’t believe them at all.” Thus far, the president has remained uncharacteristically restrained in his response to the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, who he said “is not a man that deserves this.” But the messages emanating from Mr. Trump’s party — and his family — have been characteristically gross. On Saturday, Donald Trump Jr. took to Instagram to mock the allegations, which were at that time still anonymous. Under the heading “Judge Kavanaughs sexual assault letter found by Dems,” Donald Jr. posted a fake crayon-scrawled mash note: “Hi Cindy will you be my girlfriend [boxes included for checking yes or no] Love Bret.” "
1701,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is unable to account for the whereabouts of nearly 1,500 migrant children who illegally entered the United States alone this year and were placed with sponsors after leaving federal shelters, according to congressional findings released on Tuesday. The revelation echoes an admission in April by the Department of Health and Human Services that the government had similarly lost track of an additional 1,475 migrant children it had moved out of shelters last year. In findings that lawmakers described as troubling, Senate investigators said the department could not determine with certainty the whereabouts of 1,488 out of 11,254 children the agency had placed with sponsors in 2018, based on follow-up calls from April 1 to June 30. The inability to track the whereabouts of migrant children after they have been released to sponsors has raised concerns that they could end up with human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives. Since 2016, officials at the Department of Health and Human Services have called sponsors to check on children 30 days after they were placed there. But the department has also said it was not legally responsible for children after they were released from the custody of its office of refugee resettlement. Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, offered a response to the findings on Tuesday night. “As communicated to members of Congress multiple times,” she said, “these children are not ‘lost.’ Their sponsors — who are usually parents or family members and in all cases have been vetted for criminality and ability to provide for them — simply did not respond or could not be reached when this voluntary call was made.” "
1702,"LAREDO, Tex. — No one in Claudine Anne Luera’s family knows when she first met the Border Patrol agent. Her life had spiraled in recent years, as her heroin addiction consumed her. She lost custody of her five children. Not far from the house where she was born and raised in this South Texas border city, Ms. Luera, 42, seemed lost to those who knew her, trading sex to feed her addiction and living nowhere in particular, at friends’ houses and hotels. One evening last week, her 17-year-old autistic son called her to share his news: He was now “mainstreaming” at school and part of regular high school classes. “She was excited,” said Ms. Luera’s sister, Colette Mireles, 37. “She did get emotional, but it sounded more of happiness.” That was the last time Ms. Mireles spoke to her sister. Ms. Luera’s body was found just a few days later, and the Border Patrol agent she had met shortly before her death — Juan David Ortiz, 35, a Navy veteran who was a supervisory officer in the agency’s sprawling Laredo sector — was charged with killing her and three others. In a case that has shocked a city where the ubiquitous green uniforms of the Border Patrol inspire both respect and fear, Mr. Ortiz has been accused of shooting and killing four people in a 12-day killing spree and dumping their bodies along roadsides. All of the victims, as well as a fifth person who managed to escape and helped the police capture him, were some of Laredo’s down-and-out — those who struggled with drug and alcohol addiction, and who had a history of run-ins with the law, law enforcement officials and relatives said. “We’re thinking that maybe he was preying on them, picking them up frequently, probably thinking no one’s going to care for them, no one’s going to wonder if they go missing,” Ms. Mireles said. “She didn’t deserve to die like this. She was loved by her family and her friends. She was someone. She was never forgotten.” "
1703,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, of sexual assault, has not yet agreed to testify at a public hearing planned for Monday. The hearing, which was scheduled under pressure from lawmakers who said they wanted to hear from Dr. Blasey, promises to become a riveting public spectacle — and one with potentially grave implications for Judge Kavanaugh, who until last week was considered to be on a glide path to confirmation. For many, the case recalls the 1991 confirmation hearings for Justice Clarence Thomas, who was accused of sexual harassment by the law professor Anita Hill. In an Op-Ed today, Ms. Hill urged the Senate Judiciary Committee to learn from the experience, saying it “must demonstrate a clear understanding that sexual violence is a social reality to which elected representatives must respond.” _____ "
1704,"President Xi Jinping has imposed China’s most sweeping internment program since Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, when more than one million people were killed and millions of others were imprisoned, tortured and humiliated. Citing credible reports, a United Nations panel last month said up to one million Uighurs, a Turkic Muslim minority, are being held in detention camps without benefit of any formal legal process. The repression is severe enough to have raised concerns even within the Trump administration — not known for a preoccupation with human rights abroad — and the administration is weighing possible sanctions against the regime, a step that justice clearly demands. Mr. Xi is China’s most powerful modern leader, and he is turning his country into an economic and political powerhouse. But his achievements are deeply tainted by human rights abuses, including the repression of the Uighurs, the largest of the Muslim ethnic groups in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China. Uighurs are being accused of having an “ideological virus” and are sometimes detained for nothing more than reciting a verse of the Quran at a funeral. Held in heavily guarded, often secret camps and cut off from their families, prisoners are forced to listen to indoctrination lectures that human rights activists describe as brainwashing, write self-criticism letters and renounce their commitment to Islam. All are chilling echoes of the Cultural Revolution. Aided by technology — some of which American companies are believed to be selling to Chinese firms — the Communist Party’s overseer in Xinjiang, Chen Quanguo, has intruded into the lives of Uighurs even when they are not detained in the camps. Security forces collect DNA samples when Uighurs undergo state-run medical checkups, install GPS tracking systems in vehicles and cellphones and operate checkpoints and other dehumanizing surveillance, like cameras installed in some homes.

__________ A quick take on some of the important finance and business stories of the day. Tesla just can’t move beyond Elon Musk’s tweet: Tesla said on Tuesday that the Justice Department had contacted the company for information after its chief executive, Elon Musk, abruptly announced last month that he had lined up funding to take the electric-car maker private. Shares of Tesla fell more than 3 percent and are off nearly 25 percent since Aug. 7, the day Mr. Musk made the announcement on Twitter. Investors are more worried about trade than it appears? Major stock indexes in the United States finished solidly higher Tuesday despite the escalating trade war between the United States and China. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index has rallied about 7 percent since the end of May, when President Trump put tariffs on steel and aluminum in place. But don’t take that to mean investors aren’t worried. Trade topped the list of concerns for a fourth straight month in Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s monthly survey of fund managers, although investors are somewhat less worried about it than they were in August. So why haven’t the markets pulled back more? The United States economy is seeing strong growth and corporate earnings are booming. That comes at a time that the global economy is cooling. How long can this divergence continue? Nearly half the fund managers in the Bank of America survey said they expected domestic growth to slow, bringing the United States back to the pack. Only 24 percent of respondents expected the United States to continue to perform better. "
1706,"This week marks the 40th anniversary of the Camp David accords — the high-water mark of Middle East peacemaking. How far we have fallen since then. It makes you weep. Rather than a breakthrough, Israelis and Palestinians seem to be inching closer and closer to a total breakdown. Without some dramatic advance, there is a real chance that whatever Palestinian governance exists will crumble, and Israel will have to take full responsibility for the health, education and welfare of the 2.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank. Israel would then have to decide whether to govern the West Bank with one legal authority or two, which would mean Israel would be choosing between bi-nationalism and apartheid, both disasters for a Jewish democracy. So many people are acting badly. Hamas is pursuing a strategy of human sacrifice in Gaza — throwing wave after wave of protesters against the Israeli border fence to die without purpose or even much notice anymore. It is shameful. Hamas has been a curse on the Palestinian people. At a time when the key to any Palestinian breakthrough with Israel is for Palestinians to make Israelis feel strategically secure but morally insecure about holding occupied territories, Hamas, with its relentless tunnel-digging into Israel and border assaults — unaccompanied by any offer of a two-state solution — does everything to make Israelis feel strategically insecure and morally secure about holding territories. Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu of Israel has been a brilliant strategist in confronting Iran and managing Russia in Syria. But on the Palestinian issue, all he has is a P.R. strategy — he uses all his intelligence to find ways to make sure the Palestinians get blamed in the U.S. for any absence of progress — without offering any new, or old, ideas on how to separate from the Palestinians to avoid the terrible choices of bi-nationalism and apartheid.

1707,"It was 36 years ago. The accusation: There was a party, alcohol. A 17-year-old boy was drunk and started groping a 15-year-old girl, pinning her down and covering her mouth so she couldn’t scream. Today, she doesn’t remember some of the details. He insists it didn’t happen at all. It was 36 years ago. The culture: What 15-year-old girl would tell her parents she had been at a party where kids had been drinking, much less that a boy had attacked her? It was 36 years ago. The country: Ronald Reagan was president. The Supreme Court had only one female associate justice, its first, Sandra Day O’Connor. It was nine years before the Clarence Thomas hearings, where the spectacle of an all-male Senate panel casting doubt upon Anita Hill would provoke the outrage that drove a record number of women to run for — and win — congressional office. A very different United States is now deep into a debate over how long-ago allegations involving teenagers and alcohol should be regarded and treated in the confirmation process of the accused, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, in his nomination to the Supreme Court. It’s unclear where the confrontation is headed: The Senate Judiciary Committee has called both Judge Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, to testify before the Senate Monday, but she has not committed to appearing. Both Democrats and Republicans have to carefully consider how their response affects their strategy just seven weeks before a midterm election where women are crucial voters. Democrats have to worry about older women and those who have raised teenagers, who may be skeptical that an allegation from adolescence should doom a person as an adult, no matter what they think of this pick by President Trump. Republicans have to be mindful of the generational shift that has made the country far more vigilant on matters of sexual misconduct, and of the women demanding that the allegations made by Dr. Blasey, now a research psychologist in Northern California, be taken seriously.

1708,"If Time magazine runs another cover in a series of illustrations showing President Trump’s Oval Office taking on water, employees and shareholders of Salesforce might want to brace for a tweetstorm from the White House — or even calls for regulation of the software company. Marc Benioff, a co-founder and the chief executive of Salesforce, and his wife, Lynne, are buying Time and coming to the rescue of one of journalism’s iconic institutions with the intent of protecting it. They are also throwing Salesforce, its employees and its investors — not necessarily willingly — into the public square. Just look at Amazon and The Washington Post. Mr. Trump often derides Amazon in part because Jeff Bezos, its founder and chief executive, owns the paper. The president openly attacks what he calls the “Amazon Washington Post”; described the paper as an “expensive lobbyist” for the company, despite Mr. Bezos’ insistence that he has no hand in the newspaper’s reporting; and complained about Amazon’s collection of sales taxes. In the age of Trump, the extracurricular activities of public company executives — and the benefits and risks the activities may pose for the companies that made the executives wealthy — have created new corporate governance questions. "
1709,"In an effort to shed more light on how we work, The Times is running a series of short posts explaining some of our journalistic practices. Read more from this series here. At first glance, there’s nothing unusual about the stack of mail on Gabriel Dance’s desk: a handful of envelopes, variously sized, addressed to “Tips” at The New York Times, with no return addresses. (Anonymously submitted letters and documents, after all, have long played a part in The Times’s news gathering, as was seen in our publication of Donald J. Trump’s tax records in October 2016.) But the cellphone Mr. Dance keeps eying tells the story of an innovative Times initiative: a set of digital channels intended to receive confidential news tips. As a matter of practice, journalists at The Times have long used digital security measures — encrypted communications and storage — when handling sensitive information. But in December 2016, Mr. Dance, the deputy investigations editor, teamed up with Runa Sandvik, the senior director of information security, to gather a set of tools for readers to anonymously submit information that might be of journalistic interest to The Times. The tools — WhatsApp, Signal, SecureDrop and encrypted email — are listed on nytimes.com on a centralized tips page, which outlines each method’s strengths and vulnerabilities. From there, users can download the appropriate software and use it to transmit their tips to The Times. The effect on the newsroom was immediate. “We received useful information within 24 hours of launching,” Ms. Sandvik said. Recently the tips have been arriving at a rate of more than 100 per day. They range from single-sentence suggestions to databases with hundreds of thousands of records. "
1710,"Near the end of the debate between New York governor Andrew Cuomo and Cynthia Nixon, his Democratic primary challenger, one of the moderators prefaced a question to Ms. Nixon by referencing her net worth. “Given your personal wealth, reported to be in the tens of millions of dollars — ” CBS anchorman Maurice DuBois started before Ms. Nixon interrupted: “ — which is not true.” “It’s been reported,” he said. “You can’t trust Google,” Ms. Nixon said, knowing everyone does. The net worth of Cynthia Nixon, who would go on to lose that primary, has indeed been reported at $60 million. It’s been reported by the New York Observer, Washington Times, NYLON magazine, Bustle, the British tabloid The Sun and Newsweek. Perhaps most importantly, if you Google “Cynthia Nixon net worth,” the website displays “$60 million” in bold in a big featured box at the top of the page. (Alexa gives the same answer.) The source for the number on Google and in all the articles is a website called Celebrity Net Worth, and the source for the number on that site is “a proprietary algorithm.” CelebrityNetWorth.com, and let’s call it CNW, was founded by Brian Warner in 2009 — not the same Brian Warner who performs under the name Marilyn Manson (Celebrity Net Worth: $25 million). The site’s home page is full of standard curiosity-gap clickbait in a celebrity finance flavor, with headlines like “Billionaire Michael Jordan Has Zero Influence On Which Players Wear His Shoes, And The Reason Why Is Kind Of Strange …” and “How Much Money Did Colonel Sanders Make Off Kentucky Fried Chicken? Not As Much As You’d Guess!” But CNW’s core product is the collection of pages it maintains for celebrities (of varying degrees of celebrity) with authoritatively phrased estimates as to how much money they have. These pages include single paragraphs of biographical info, but they’re rendered practically unreadable by formatting. What readers are after is a single number, at the top of the page in big type: $20 million (Chris Pine), $40 million (Chris Pratt), $90 million (Chris Hemsworth). If you want to know how rich (or not) a celebrity is, CNW has an answer. No one is vouching for the veracity of that answer — CNW’s proprietors “expressly exclude liability for any such inaccuracies or errors to the fullest extent permitted by law,” according to the terms of use — but it's an answer nonetheless. So how does CNW determine that, financially, the superhero Chrises could stack inside each other like matryoshka dolls? The authoritative tone of the site implies that somewhere there’s a computer mainframe running a program that monitors headlines, real estate sales, art auctions and whatever else, then processes that data and spits out a useful number. But that seems implausible, in part because CNW has no computer scientists on staff. While freelancers write most of the clickbait, every “net worth” page is posted from Mr. Warner’s author account. Mr. Warner did not respond to emails or phone calls. John Warner — attorney, site co-owner and father — declined to answer questions on the younger Mr. Warner’s behalf. “The site is what it is,” he said when reached by phone. “It’s online. You can visit it.” If you examine CNW closely, you can see what looks like a human hand behind the magic occasionally slip into view. “The Cosby Show” actor Geoffrey Owens was listed at half a million dollars until Sept. 1, when photos of Mr. Owens working a retail job went public, whereupon his number was revised downward to $300,000. With some exceptions — such as that of Lindsay Lohan, who is valued at $800,000 at CNW — the numbers tend to be higher than one might expect for A-listers. "
1711,"To the Editor: When I was young (I am 72), the kind of behavior that Judge Brett Kavanaugh is accused of was not at all uncommon. If you were attacked, you didn’t tell anyone — not your parents, not your teachers, not your girlfriends, no one. You internalized the experience and moved on with your life. You believed the old saw that “boys will be boys” and that somehow you bore the full responsibility of what had happened to you. When Donald Trump was elected, for many of us the horror of what had happened when we were young was exposed for the first time in years. The guilt, humiliation and pain that had been safely tucked away never to be thought about consciously since being attacked came flooding back. The backlash against Christine Blasey Ford, Judge Kavanaugh’s accuser, is exactly why women have kept silent about their attacks and attackers. It’s time to come out of the shadows and tell our stories with courage and the conviction that by publicly recounting our personal nightmares, we can heal one another and give strength to our younger sisters as they navigate the waters of sexual abuse. Miriam Pickett
Highland, N.Y. To the Editor: I was sexually assaulted as a young woman. Christine Blasey Ford’s account of her experience rings true for me. I never called the police, although I felt certain that I knew who attacked me. I told only one close friend at the time, and it was years before I told anyone else. I couldn’t bring myself to tell my parents. I felt frightened, embarrassed and ashamed; I just wanted to put it behind me. "
1712,"With Hurricane Florence looming, Lucy, her husband and their twin 16-year-old daughters sat frozen in their living room last week on Johns Island, off the coast of South Carolina, unsure of what to do. The storm threatened to plow into the modest home that the nonprofit Habitat for Humanity had built for them more than a decade earlier, but they were afraid to drive to a shelter. “For undocumented people, driving is always a stressful situation,” said Lucy, who asked that her last name not be published because of her immigration status and that of her husband, who is also undocumented. Through their windows, the family saw red and blue lights multiply around them last week as government workers moved in to mark off emergency routes and clear brush that could become dangerous. The police were everywhere, Lucy said. “You feel fear from head to toe.” For families like hers who live with the constant fear of deportation, the storm that has devastated large swaths of the Southeast presented an extra set of challenges. Many immigrants in the Carolinas live in trailers and other forms of low-income housing that can be especially vulnerable in natural disasters. Hurricane Florence forced them to think about whether seeking government resources like shelter, food or other aid would help them get through the storm, or put them at greater risk. The dilemma was not helped by conflicting messages from the authorities in recent days about how they planned to deal, or not, with the issue of undocumented immigrants seeking help in a region that was facing not only intense rain and flooding, but months of recovery. Last week, a spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement that the agency would not conduct enforcement operations in areas affected by the storm. But Jeff Byard, an associate administrator for response and recovery for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said in a news conference the same day, “I’m not going to use the terminology ‘guarantee,’” when reporters asked if immigrants without legal status would be safe in shelters. "
1713,"When hurricane Florence struck the Carolinas last week, humanity played a role in the destruction. Human intervention is making natural disasters unnaturally harmful, both in causes and effects, and the number of ways our own influence is making things worse, taken together, is sobering. On a global scale, we are bolstering the destructive potential of hurricanes and other extreme weather events by driving climate change. At the local level, we remain reluctant to deal with the problems of our own making, building and rebuilding in risky areas even as we avoid the policies and investment that would help mitigate the threats. Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said that people tended to think of climate change as an abstract problem with only technocratic solutions. But it is getting more concrete all the time, and requires real-life action in response. “This year has shown us that climate change is a present-day threat to the safety and livelihoods of communities across America,” she said. “Some communities are tackling these issues head on, but some have their heads in the sand.” The human contribution to heating up the planet by burning fossil fuels is already nudging up the destructiveness of hurricanes like Florence and last year’s Hurricane Harvey in some ways, and will have even greater effects over time: “Climate change is expected to make intense hurricanes more intense,” said Andrew Dessler, a climate expert at Texas A&M University. The consequences of human-driven climate change on hurricanes plays out in a number of ways. Hurricanes get energy from warm ocean water, and the oceans are heating up. (The waters Florence encountered were, in fact, warmer than normal.) Compounding the problem, warmer air can hold more moisture, which can lead to the kinds of intense rain events and high levels of inland flooding associated with storms like Florence. "
1714,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Emily Badger, who writes about cities and urban policy for The Upshot in Washington, discussed the tech she’s using. Q. As a writer for The Upshot, you do a lot of analysis, including on the effects and consequences of technology. What are the best websites and tech tools that you use regularly for that coverage? A. I write about cities and urban policy, so I spend a lot of time trying to get a feel for communities other than the one where I live. I look at other cities in satellite maps. I walk around their neighborhoods on Google Street View. I particularly like the time-lapse feature in Street View that lets you see how neighborhoods have changed as Google’s cars have passed over time. In many places, the images go back to 2007, which is enough time to see substantial change — for example, along H Street Northeast in Washington or in the Mission Bay neighborhood of San Francisco. You can watch the Trump International Hotel and Tower under construction in Chicago and see when, by 2015, Donald J. Trump prominently stuck his name on the building, offending a lot of Chicago architecture buffs. I also like to know how places vote. For the 2016 election, I refer to a pretty incredible interactive precinct-level map The Times published this year. I draw information from the Census Bureau on things like demographics, population change and housing stock. The University of Virginia’s Racial Dot Map, based on the 2010 census, is a fantastic resource for eyeballing patterns of racial segregation; also, it’s just beautiful to look at. And I spend a lot of time lurking on the housing market in other cities through sites like Trulia and Zillow. What have you found are some of the main unintended consequences of technology on how we live? For nearly every form of technology I use for work, or use for myself, I have mixed feelings. (These mixed feelings are also a good source of story ideas.) I love apps, like Redfin, that make public information about the housing market incredibly accessible. But I wonder if they also reinforce the unhealthy American expectation that we should all make money off our homes. "
1715,"WASHINGTON — Foreign terrorist groups and their affiliates had a bad year in 2017 as the United States and other countries fought back against the Islamic State, but Al Qaeda and Iranian-backed militias remain deadly threats, according to an annual government terrorism report that was released on Wednesday. There were 8,584 terrorist attacks around the world in 2017, a 23 percent decline from 2016, according to the State Department report. As a result, more than 18,700 people were killed, about a quarter of whom were the perpetrators themselves. That death toll represented a 27 percent drop from the previous year, the report said. Much of the reason for the decline was the improved security situation in Iraq, according to Ambassador Nathan Sales, the State Department’s coordinator for counterterrorism. Still, more than half of all terrorist attacks worldwide took place in just five countries: Afghanistan, India, Iraq, Pakistan and the Philippines. And 70 percent of all deaths from terrorist attacks occurred in a different, if overlapping, set of five countries: Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia and Syria. The security situation in Afghanistan continued to worsen as a result of coordinated attacks by the Taliban, including the group’s affiliated Haqqani network, the report noted. Some of the attacks were planned and launched from safe havens in Pakistan, a source of continuing irritation in relations between Washington and Islamabad. Although four countries are designated as state sponsors of terrorism, the report highlighted Iran as a top threat. "
1716,"BERLIN — For nearly two weeks Chancellor Angela Merkel tried to find a way to fire her own domestic intelligence chief, a man who had publicly contradicted her and become the darling of the far right for questioning the authenticity of a video showing angry white men chasing an immigrant. But she couldn’t — not without risking the collapse of her fragile government. Hans-Georg Maassen, the rebellious spy, has powerful friends, among them his immediate boss, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, the leader of the Bavarian conservatives and one of Ms. Merkel’s pricklier coalition partners. Instead of firing Mr. Maassen, Ms. Merkel had to allow Mr. Seehofer to promote him. Mr. Maassen will get a pay raise of about 2,500 euros a month. “You couldn’t make it up,” said Andrea Römmele, a professor of political science at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. If the episode shows anything, analysts said in the aftermath, it is that Ms. Merkel is growing more feeble even as the far right — in Parliament, online and on the streets — is getting stronger. The chancellor’s inability to act decisively has exposed the spectacular weakening of a leader who not long ago was seen as a key defender of the liberal order. That view was cemented by her decision in 2015 to welcome to Germany hundreds of thousands of migrants from the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere who were not wanted by neighboring European countries.

1717,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A significant promise from North Korea, a new economic Cold War, an unsettling temple in Taiwan. Here’s what you need to know: • Limited pledges from North Korea. Kim Jong-un promised some concrete steps toward denuclearization, including dismantling facilities central to the production of fuel for nuclear warheads. On Day 2 of a three-day summit meeting with South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, Mr. Kim also vowed to visit Seoul. He would be the first North Korean leader to visit the South’s capital. But Mr. Kim stopped short of agreeing to denuclearize, saying that would happen only if the U.S. took “corresponding” measures, including formally declaring an end to the Korean War. Today’s word is “warhead”: the part of the missile that actually explodes. North Korea’s weapons program is shrouded in secrecy, but experts believe it has fewer than 10 nuclear warheads. _____ "
1718,"Just minutes after Christine Blasey Ford, a California-based psychologist, went public with accusations of teenage sexual assault against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, internet investigators began combing her past for clues about her possible motives, and trying to cast doubt on the veracity of her claims. Since then, Dr. Blasey, as she is known professionally, has been the subject of a torrent of misinformation online. Some viral rumors about Dr. Blasey have been quickly debunked. But false claims have continued to spread on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and other social networks. Here are several of the most visible false and misleading claims about Dr. Blasey, along with explanations of what’s really happening. This viral rumor is based on a case of mistaken identity. The RateMyProfessors.com page on which these negative reviews were found is about Christine A. Ford, a professor of human services at California State University Fullerton. Christine Blasey Ford, Judge Kavanaugh’s accuser, teaches at Palo Alto University. This story made an early appearance on Grabien, a little-known news website. It was then picked up by several right-wing media outlets, including by the Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who tweeted a link to it, and the Drudge Report, which featured it on its home page. Grabien later issued a correction and published an editor’s note apologizing for the error. But the article remained online, and several other websites have since picked it up. "
1719,"The text message from Christine Blasey Ford this summer worried her college best friend, Catherine Piwowarski. Over their years of friendship — as roommates, bridesmaids and parents on opposite coasts — Dr. Blasey wanted to know, had she ever confided that she had been sexually assaulted in high school? No, Ms. Piwowarski said she texted back, she would have remembered that, and was everything O.K.? Dr. Blasey didn’t want to speak in detail quite yet, her friend recalled her responding. “I don’t know why she was asking that or what it ultimately meant or didn’t mean,” Ms. Piwowarski said in an interview, but she remembers thinking that the question betrayed deep turmoil. That was about a month before Dr. Blasey, a research psychologist, came forward with her allegation that Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, sexually assaulted her more than three decades ago when they were high school students in the Washington suburbs. Just days ago, both Dr. Blasey and Judge Kavanaugh — who has denied sexually assaulting her, or anyone — had been expected to testify on Monday before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the allegation, setting up a contest of credibility reminiscent of 1991, when Anita Hill leveled accusations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas, then a Supreme Court nominee. But it is increasingly uncertain whether that will happen. Dr. Blasey’s lawyers on Tuesday called for an F.B.I. investigation of her allegation before she testifies, but the Senate Republican leadership has rejected the idea and said that a vote on the Kavanaugh nomination will go forward if she does not appear. [Dr. Blasey has agreed to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Read more on the latest developments.] "
1720,"ALBANY — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo might have assumed that his big win in last week’s Democratic primary would end talk about the last-minute piece of campaign mail that falsely suggested his opponent, Cynthia Nixon, was ambivalent about anti-Semitism. He was mistaken. Nearly a week after Mr. Cuomo’s impressive victory, the mailer was once again stirring up questions on Wednesday about who among the governor’s inner circle had known of it, as well as providing a renewed talking point for Marcus J. Molinaro, the Republican candidate for governor. Paid for by the state Democratic Party, which is effectively controlled by Mr. Cuomo, the flier was sent to about 7,000 households in largely Jewish neighborhoods just before Rosh Hashana and the primary. It included several false claims, including an insinuation that Ms. Nixon had been “silent on the rise of anti-Semitism.” Two days before the primary, the Cuomo campaign had said only that the mailer was the result of “an individual helping the campaign on constituency outreach.” The following day, however, the campaign provided more information, offering that individual’s name, David Lobl, and saying that Lawrence S. Schwartz, formerly the governor’s top lieutenant, had inadvertently approved the mailer while serving as a campaign volunteer. The campaign said that Mr. Schwartz had only seen one side of the flier, and did not see the inflammatory language on the reverse side. “I would have never approved that mailer to go out had I seen it in its totality,” he said last week to The New York Times. “It was totally inappropriate.” "

__________ A mania appears to have gripped cannabis stocks. Tilray, a Canadian maker of cannabis products, surged as much as 94 percent Wednesday, gave it all back and then rallied again in the final 18 minutes to close up nearly 40 percent. Along the way, trading in the stock was halted four times. The company went public in July at $17 a share and has soared nearly 1,160 percent to close Wednesday at $214.06. Tilray is now valued at $20 billion, making it roughly the same size as American Airlines, CBS and Hershey. The Amazon effect strikes specialty retailers. Amazon, according to CNBC, is testing out a new service, called Scout, that is designed to make it easier for consumers to browse by asking them to give a thumbs up or a thumbs down to products and then showing other products based on their choices. News of the service hit the stocks of specialty retailers. Shares of Stitch Fix were down 6 percent on Wednesday, while Wayfair and Etsy were off nearly 3 percent. Companies have been stockpiling ahead of the latest round of tariffs on Chinese goods. Imports of more than 80 percent of the product lines covered by the tariffs increased from May through July, and imports of over a quarter of those product lines jumped by more than 25 percent, according to S7P Global’s Panjiva, a supply chain data firm.

1723,"Roughly a century ago, men like William Randolph Hearst, Joseph Pulitzer and Henry Luce dominated the media landscape. These moguls built their publishing empires and used them to intimidate rivals, espouse favored causes and settle scores. Today, members of a new Gilded Age are again in control of many of the country’s most venerable media outlets. Only now, it is tech entrepreneurs, casino magnates and hedge fund billionaires who are seizing control of the press, simply by writing a check. In the most recent transaction, Marc Benioff, the founder of the software company Salesforce, bought Time magazine on Sunday for $190 million in cash. With the deal, Mr. Benioff joined an elite club of relatively new press barons that includes the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post; Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and the head of the Emerson Collective, who acquired a majority stake in The Atlantic; and Michael R. Bloomberg, who owns Businessweek and Bloomberg News. At a moment when many print publications are struggling to survive, the largess of a wealthy owner can seem like a godsend. But there are also fresh concerns, some based on recent experience, that these individuals are assuming an unhealthy amount of influence. “Even good billionaires need to have less of a role in our public life,” said Anand Giridharadas, author of “Winners Take All,” a new book about the global elite. “They are buying up the free press, which is meant to hold them accountable.” "
1724,"As a psychiatrist I know something about how memory works. Neuroscience research tells us that memories formed under the influence of intense emotion — such as the feelings that accompany a sexual assault — are indelible in the way that memories of a routine day are not. That’s why it’s credible that Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, of sexually assaulting her when they were both teenagers, has a vivid recollection of the alleged long-ago event. “I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” she told The Washington Post in a recent interview. “He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.” Judge Kavanaugh has vigorously denied the charges, leading to a public debate about whether Dr. Blasey’s story is true. Her lawyers say she wants the F.B.I. to investigate before she agrees to testify before the Senate. If and when she does testify, you can bet that Republican senators will try to undermine her explosive claim on the basis that the memory of an event that occurred 36 years ago must be unreliable because it happened in the distant past. If she does not testify, some of her critics will undoubtedly argue that the time that’s passed is reason to doubt her recollection. Nothing could be further from the truth. The reason has to do with the way memories are encoded when a person is experiencing intense emotions. When people are assaulted, for example, they experience a surge of norepinephrine, a stress hormone that is a relative of adrenaline. The role of norepinephrine in the enhancement of memory was demonstrated by a 1994 study in which researchers randomly gave subjects either propranolol, a drug that blocks the effect of norepinephrine, or a placebo just before they heard either an emotionally arousing story or a neutral one. Then they tested subjects’ memories of both stories a week later and found that propranolol selectively impaired recall of the emotionally arousing story but not the neutral story. The clear implication of this study is that emotion raises norepinephrine, which then strengthens memory. "
1725,"Whatever becomes of Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s process for considering him has been a mockery from the start — a mockery of lawmakers’ constitutional responsibility and of the ideal that the court should be anything more than a political trophy. The bulk of the blame lies with Senator Chuck Grassley, the committee chairman, and his fellow Republicans, who have abused their power by refusing to let their colleagues and the American people see over 90 percent of the documents relating to Judge Kavanaugh’s critical years in the federal government. Judge Kavanaugh sullied the proceedings himself by testifying, under oath, in ways that were at best misleading, about his role in several high-profile actions taken by the George W. Bush administration, where he worked in the White House counsel’s office and as staff secretary to the president. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the committee, is also now facing legitimate questions, over her handling of the sexual-assault allegation against Judge Kavanaugh that she received this summer but held back, based on a request for confidentiality, until it was leaked to the news media last week. Now the committee has a chance to partly redeem itself, by allowing a thorough investigation and then holding an open hearing to address Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation against Judge Kavanaugh about a night while they were in high school. Republicans complain that this is nothing but a Democratic plot to derail Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination by delaying any vote until after the midterm elections. (If anyone knows about unjustly delaying Supreme Court confirmations, it’s Senate Republicans.) Well, Democrats no doubt would prefer to delay a vote. "
1726,"O.K., I know you’re obsessed about sex and the Supreme Court. But the hurricane flooding in North Carolina has been terrible. Let’s give it some serious thought right now. Particularly when it comes to ways the government screwed up. First lesson is easy. Coastal flooding is getting way, way worse because of global warming. So obviously we’ve got to join other nations in combating this universally recognized threat. Hahahahaha. Yeah, yeah. President Trump does not believe in climate change. Who among us can forget the time he claimed the whole idea was a Chinese plot to ruin American manufacturing? Maybe he’ll evolve. After all, Trump does occasionally show some concern for nature. When he visited North Carolina on Wednesday, he particularly inquired about the well-being of the state’s Lake Norman. (“I love that area — I can’t tell you why, but I love that area.”) Well-informed observers did note that there happens to be a Trump golf club on Lake Norman’s shores. The president came in for some criticism when, while distributing free hot dog lunches, he told one flood victim to “have a good time.” It is absolutely true that our commander in chief tends to babble. But in the grand scheme of things, this would seem to rank much lower as a problem than, say, ignoring the rising oceans and exploding weather systems. "
1727,"Senator Dean Heller on Wednesday called President Trump “a great leader” who had revived Nevada’s economy, a striking departure from the arm’s-length approach Mr. Heller took with Mr. Trump in the 2016 campaign and in the first months of his presidency. In a private conference call with White House aides, other Nevada Republican officials and local activists, Mr. Heller — the most endangered Senate Republican up for re-election this November — offered an unqualified embrace of the president. “Our arms are wide open,” Mr. Heller said on the call, held to drum up interest in Mr. Trump’s campaign rally scheduled for Thursday in Las Vegas. “We’re so thrilled to have the president.” Mr. Heller has steadily moved closer to Mr. Trump, finally acknowledging last year that he voted for the president, but the senator has not gone as far in public as he did Wednesday. Mr. Heller memorably said in October 2016, weeks before the presidential election, that he was “100 percent against Clinton, 99 percent against Trump.” On Wednesday, noting that Nevada is now No. 1 in job creation per capita, Mr. Heller said, “My message is going to be Nevada is back to work, and it’s back to work because of this president.” The only Senate Republican running in a state that Hillary Clinton carried in the 2016 election, Mr. Heller is facing a pricey and highly competitive race against Representative Jacky Rosen, the Democratic nominee. Recently polling indicates that the race is effectively tied, and that about half of Nevadans do not approve of the president. "
1728,"President Trump has been a regular speaker at recent Values Voter Summits, and for this year’s event, he will send Vice President Mike Pence to rally the religious right. This will not surprise many people on the left who have questioned the authenticity of social conservatives’ values and their place in the Trump-Pence coalition. They think the religious right has compromised its Christian values in order to attain political power for Republicans. But new data suggest the left may have a lot more common ground with some of these conservatives than it thinks.  In a Democracy Fund Voter Study Group report, I found that religious conservatives are far more supportive of diversity and immigration than secular conservatives. Religion appears to actually be moderating conservative attitudes, particularly on some of the most polarizing issues of our time: race, immigration and identity. Churchgoing Trump voters have more favorable feelings toward African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Jews, Muslims and immigrants compared with nonreligious Trump voters. This holds up even while accounting for demographic factors like education and race. Churchgoing Trump voters care far more than nonreligious ones about racial equality (67 percent versus 49 percent) and reducing poverty (42 percent versus 23 percent). These differences are reflected in their actions, too. Mr. Trump’s most religiously observant voters are three times as likely as secular Trump voters to volunteer — and not just with their own church. Sixty-one percent of the president’s most devout base volunteered in the past year compared with 20 percent of conservatives without religious affiliation. Religious participation also appears to pull Mr. Trump’s supporters away from the administration’s immigration policy. The more frequently Trump voters attend church, the more they support offering citizenship to unauthorized immigrants and making the immigration process easier, and the more opposed they become to the border wall. In fact, many conservative Christian churches disapprove of the Trump administration’s handling of immigration. The National Association of Evangelicals, representing 45,000 churches, asked President Trump to end family separation at the border because it caused “traumatic effects” on young children. It also urged the administration to “resume a robust U.S. refugee resettlement program.” "
1729,"WASHINGTON — President Trump nominated Nellie Liang, a longtime Federal Reserve staff member who is an expert on financial regulation, on Wednesday to join the Fed’s board of governors. Ms. Liang, 60, played a key role in the Fed’s efforts to tighten oversight of the financial system after the 2008 crisis, including the creation of a new Fed department focused on monitoring financial stability. She is well known and well regarded in the close-knit world of central banking, and Mr. Trump’s decision was applauded by her peers. Carl R. Tannenbaum, the chief economist at Northern Trust, called the nomination an “inspired choice.” Ms. Liang, a registered Democrat, would bring to the Fed’s board deep experience on questions of regulation and the stability of the financial system, an area that the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, has described as increasingly important. Her views, however, appear to conflict with those of Mr. Trump, who has called for the Fed to reduce its postcrisis strictures on the banks. In a presentation last week at the Brookings Institution, Ms. Liang reiterated her support for tougher postcrisis regulations. “The regulatory and supervisory structure needs to be kept up-to-date with changes in the financial system, and to make it more resilient to a wider range of shocks,” she said. Krishna Guha, the head of the central bank strategy team at Evercore ISI, said Ms. Liang was likely to be open to efforts to streamline and perhaps to prune postcrisis safeguards. He added, however, that “she is unlikely to favor any wholesale pullback from the postcrisis regime.” "
1730,"Donald Trump and Senate Republicans have no interest whatsoever in revealing the whole truth about Brett Kavanaugh. Their plan was to perform a rush-job confirmation that installed him on the Supreme Court over all objections well enough in advance of the midterm elections to provide a shield to Republicans worried about what feels like an imminent blue wave. That is why his hearings were scheduled so quickly. That is why more than 42,000 pages of documents were released the night before his confirmation hearings started — all of which were to be treated as “committee-confidential” at the time. As The New York Times editorial board wrote then, Republicans are “now running the most secretive and incomplete confirmation process in modern history.” The hearings wrapped up with Kavanaugh having dodged direct answers to questions on major issues like abortion (Trump has said he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade) and presidential power (this may well come before the court if Trump is subpoenaed, charged with a crime or attempts to pardon himself). Republicans felt confident that their ploy had worked, but that was before the bombshell accusation by Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor, that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in the 1980s when she was 15 and he was 17. "
1731,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] I’ve spent a significant share of the last few years thinking about Hillary Clinton. As a reporter assigned to cover her campaign, I was there when she launched her first tour in Iowa. (Remember this scene of reporters chasing her van? Yes, I ran too.) And I was there at the bitter end, when she gave her concession speech, standing among the sobbing aides and an ashen Bill Clinton. If you had told me, on the day of that final speech, that Mrs. Clinton’s loss would ignite a national movement of women, millions who would attend marches and hundreds who would run for office, I wouldn’t have believed it. Honestly, I probably would have laughed in your face. I couldn’t have been more wrong. During the Trump administration, women have flooded into politics in unprecedented numbers. One poll found that women made 86 percent of the calls to Congress in President Trump’s first few months in office. Research released a few months later found that 70 percent of the people in Democratic groups that have sprung up since the election are women. A record-breaking 257 women are now running for the House and Senate. With the primaries complete, it seemed like a good time to take stock of this still-young movement. I called up Kelly Dittmar, a political-science professor at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, which has been tracking the number of women in politics for nearly 50 years. "
1732,"Cody Wilson, whose push to post blueprints for 3-D printed guns online has made him a key figure in the national gun control debate, was charged on Wednesday with sexually assaulting a child in Texas. But law enforcement officers said they were having trouble finding Mr. Wilson, who missed a flight back to the United States from Taipei, Taiwan, his last known location. During a news conference on Wednesday, Cmdr. Troy Officer of the Austin Police Department said that a warrant had been filed for Mr. Wilson’s arrest and that local detectives were working with national and international partners to find him. Mr. Wilson, 30, is accused of having sex with a 16-year-old girl at a hotel in Austin on Aug. 15 and paying her $500 in cash, according to an affidavit filed in Travis County. The girl told the police that she had met Mr. Wilson through the website SugarDaddyMeet.com, where he was using the screen name “Sanjuro,” the affidavit says. Commander Officer said detectives who had interviewed the girl said that “if someone mistakes her age, it would be because they think she’s younger, not older.” She and Mr. Wilson, who identified himself to the girl, exchanged phone numbers and then continued messaging each other, sharing at least one explicit photo apiece, according to the affidavit. During one conversation, Mr. Wilson described himself as a “big deal,” the affidavit says. According to the affidavit, Mr. Wilson and the girl met in the parking lot of an Austin coffee shop that evening and left for the hotel in a black Ford Edge sport utility vehicle registered to Mr. Wilson’s company, Defense Distributed. The police were notified of the alleged assault after the girl told a counselor, and they confirmed the details using surveillance video and interviews. "
1733,"WASHINGTON — The confrontation between Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh and his accuser devolved into a polarizing stalemate on Wednesday as Democrats and Republicans advanced competing narratives to convince voters that the other side has been unfair in the Supreme Court confirmation battle. Christine Blasey Ford, the professor who alleged that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, said a Senate hearing set for Monday to hear her allegation would not be fair and Democrats insisted that an F.B.I. investigation take place first. Backed by President Trump, Senate Republicans rejected any F.B.I. inquiry, and said that Monday was her chance to be heard. Dr. Blasey’s resistance to appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday seemed to galvanize Republicans and drew wavering Republican senators back into Judge Kavanaugh’s camp. Barring new information or an agreement by Dr. Blasey to testify after all, Judge Kavanaugh may now have enough momentum to be confirmed as early as next week. Republicans set a committee meeting for Wednesday for a possible vote to move the nomination to the floor. [Read how Dr. Blasey went from the anonymity of academia to the center of a Supreme Court confirmation.] Hanging over the impasse were the midterm elections, now less than seven weeks away. Republicans were determined to confirm Judge Kavanaugh before then, knowing that if Democrats managed to win control of the Senate, it would be exponentially harder to approve any nominees sent by Mr. Trump. Conversely, for Democrats, a delay in voting on Judge Kavanaugh would increase the chances of blocking his confirmation and enhance the influence Democrats would have over who eventually fills the vacant seat. In a statement, Lisa J. Banks, a lawyer for Dr. Blasey, said on Wednesday that her client was still willing to work with the Judiciary Committee, but was not convinced that a hearing featuring just her and Judge Kavanaugh would be adequate. "
1734,"President Trump has a long history of callousness and hostility toward the plight of those involved in the criminal justice system. So for me, a public defender, one of the most surprising developments of the past two years has been to see him, of all people, vilify the kinds of aggressive law enforcement tactics and unfair prosecutorial practices that criminal justice reform advocates have been challenging for decades. Mr. Trump assailed the practice of pretrial detention as “tough” when Paul Manafort had his bail revoked before his trial began. He then bemoaned the “very unfair” power that prosecutors wield to force people in the system “to break” in the wake of the Michael Cohen plea and the Manafort jury conviction and subsequent guilty plea. He lamented the devastating collateral consequences that arise from “a mere allegation” when Rob Porter was forced to resign after being accused of domestic violence; raged about the late-night, “no knock” raids of Mr. Cohen’s properties; and expressed outrage that the government, in its investigation of Carter Page, was able to overcome the protections of the Fourth Amendment to obtain a FISA warrant with “no hearings,” while also endorsing the idea, raised by the writer Andrew McCarthy, that they should be “looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff.” Needless to say, Mr. Trump’s apparent justice renaissance has nothing to do with how our criminal justice system actually operates, and has always operated, for communities of color and people living in poverty, the vast majority of those who face arrest and prosecution in this country. No, he is outraged by how the system treats his friends. Still, it would be a mistake to dismiss his outrage over the government’s ability to turn a person’s life upside down as mere hypocrisy. I understand President Trump’s outrage. It is remarkable that people, presumed innocent, are locked up before being convicted of any crime. It is deeply unfair that mere accusations can lead to devastating, lifelong consequences. It is alarming that, in a system theoretically built around transparency and truth seeking, police and prosecutors have such outsize power to surveil, search, detain, bully, coerce and nearly destroy a person without producing evidence sufficient to secure a conviction. The framers of our Constitution were equally concerned. Over half the protections in the Bill of Rights restrict government action against people suspected of committing crimes. "
1735,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Another challenge for Angela Merkel, doubts on the Kavanaugh hearing and echoes of Cold War tactics. Here’s the latest: • Germany’s security director is out. Hans-Georg Maassen, Germany’s chief of domestic intelligence, was ejected from his post on Tuesday after a rift with Chancellor Angela Merkel. He had questioned the authenticity of a video showing an immigrant being chased by far-right protesters in Chemnitz, directly contradicting her and raising concerns that the country’s security apparatus had leaned too far right, impeding its ability to monitor neo-Nazi groups effectively. Mr. Maassen’s removal is another test for the ever-more-embattled chancellor. _____ • New steps in Korean diplomacy. Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, will visit Seoul “in the near future,” he said after meeting Wednesday in Pyongyang with the South’s president, Moon Jae-in. It would be the first trip to South Korea by any North Korean leader. Mr. Kim also agreed, at least on paper, to take additional steps to dismantle some ballistic missile and nuclear facilities. "
1736,"At least 100 state and federal law enforcement officers are scouring an Ohio city, searching for a fugitive who has eluded them across multiple states for months after threatening to “put a bullet” in President Trump’s head, the authorities said. The search became increasingly intense and focused on Sunday, after the authorities found a truck that they believe the fugitive, Shawn Richard Christy, 26, of McAdoo, Pa., had stolen. It was found in Mansfield, Ohio, a city of about 46,000, Robert Clark, a supervisory deputy United States marshal and one of the lead investigators, said in an interview on Tuesday. On June 19, a federal warrant was issued for Mr. Christy’s arrest after he wrote a post on Facebook that threatened John M. Morganelli, the district attorney of Northampton County, Pa., and President Trump. “Keep it up Morganelli, I promise I’ll put a bullet in your head as soon as I put one in the head of President Donald J. Trump,” he wrote, according to the authorities. But Mr. Christy, a self-described survivalist, was already a wanted man. There were already state warrants for his arrest, after he failed to appear in court for an aggravated assault trial, Deputy Clark said. That prompted a warrant charging him with violating probation, and the involvement of the United States Marshals Service. The F.B.I. and Secret Service became involved after the post about the president, the authorities said, adding that Mr. Christy had also threatened to use “full lethal force on any law enforcement officer that tries to detain me.” "

1738,"Hugh Jackman plays P. T. Barnum in “The Greatest Showman.” And a sitcom premieres on NBC. THE GREATEST SHOWMAN (2017) 8 p.m. on HBO2. With the Barnum & Bailey Circus shuttered and its elephants in retirement in Florida (really), this biographical quasi-musical about P. T. Barnum inspired devotion among audiences when it hit theaters in December. Hugh Jackman plays the illustrious Barnum, periodically bursting into original songs written by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. (That duo wrote the lyrics for “La La Land” and the music for “Dear Evan Hansen.”) Michelle Williams, Zac Efron, Zendaya and Rebecca Ferguson all co-star. A circus needs to be more than the sum of its spectacular parts, though, and, in his review for The New York Times, Jason Zinoman wrote that the film is less thrilling than its subject. He called it a “montage sequence that occasionally turns into a movie musical.” THE INTERPRETER (2005) 8 p.m. on Flix East. This thriller about a fictional interpreter (Nicole Kidman), who falls under the suspicion of Secret Service agents (Sean Penn and Catherine Keener), is more than a decade old but newly relevant. Parallels exist between Ms. Kidman’s character and Marina Gross, an interpreter for the State Department who faced calls from Congress to relay what she had heard during the meeting this year between President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The film finds tension in focusing on a profession whose craft involves being ignored by the spotlight even when standing right in the center of it. I FEEL BAD 10 p.m. on NBC. “I never know what I’ll feel bad about,” Emet says in the first episode of this series. “But I know it’s always just around the corner.” Sarayu Blue, known to TV audiences from the CW comedy-drama “No Tomorrow,” plays Emet, who struggles with bad co-workers (at a video game company) and family matters in this new sitcom, created by Aseem Batra (“Scrubs,” “The Cleveland Show”) and co-stars Paul Adelstein. Amy Poehler is an executive producer. THERE WILL BE BLOOD (2007) on Hulu. When the New York Philharmonic accompanied this Paul Thomas Anderson epic with a live soundtrack this month, Anthony Tommasini wrote in The Times that it was “every orchestra’s fantasy for opening night: an overflow audience full of young people, the sense of a singular event, a huge ovation.” The film’s score, by Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead, sounds great at home with headphones, too. “In a scene when oil seeps up from the ground,” Mr. Tommasini wrote, “the strings ooze and slide through a stretch of overlapping glissandos, until restless inner figures break into every-which-way counterpoint.” The film opens with just Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis, who won an Oscar for his performance), a prospector, mining for silver. He finds oil. He strikes it rich. He goes a little mad. Then there’s blood. "

1740,"Like a good Puerto Rican grandmother, Amparo Negron had a warning for her grandson on his first trip back to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria devastated the island. “When you leave New York, it will be 2017,” Jose Alvarado Jr. recalled her saying. “And when you land in Ponce, it will be 1950.” Abuela was wrong. It could have been 1900. Gone was his great-grandfather’s zinc and wood homestead in Villalba, it walls flattened like a hastily opened gift box. Gone, too, was his grandmother’s house on the same parcel of land, where fronds from her favorite palm tree dangled through the shorn roof. No water. No power. But there was hope. In that melancholy landscape of long-ago childhood summers spent chasing roosters and exploring the hillsides, Mr. Alvarado realized he had a duty to his family, if not to the island and its diaspora, too. "
1741,"In one of the first episodes of the rebooted “Murphy Brown,” the show’s title character, back at it after all these years, faces a dilemma. Murphy, a celebrity TV journalist, is being pushed by network executives to conduct an interview. It’s a chance to interrogate a Steve Bannon-like character who is a former senior adviser in the Trump White House and has a book to sell. “A ratings bonanza,” her boss insists. Should Murphy, played once again by Candice Bergen, seize the opportunity to cut the character down to size before a national audience? Or should she simply refuse to give his nativist views a platform? Two weeks after that episode was filmed, The New Yorker came under heavy fire for inviting Mr. Bannon, a former senior adviser to Mr. Trump, to its annual festival, criticized by staff and readers alike for daring to give him a soap box. That flare-up is just one reason producers and the stars of the series believe that “Murphy Brown” is as relevant now as it was in the 1990s. “Over the last few years, it would get brought up and we would just dismiss it,” Ms. Bergen, 72, said in a recent interview about rebooting the show. “We thought, what was the point? But then we thought, hmm, it just seemed the time was right, which is, of course, because of the election.” “The only thing I can thank him for,” she continued, referring to President Trump, “is to have given us unplowed fields of material.” "

1743,"WASHINGTON — President Trump is confident that the United States is winning its trade war with China. But on both sides of the Pacific, a bleaker recognition is taking hold: The world’s two largest economies are in the opening stages of a new economic Cold War, one that could persist well after Mr. Trump is out of office. “This thing will last long,” Jack Ma, the billionaire chairman of Alibaba Group, warned a meeting of investors on Tuesday in Hangzhou, China. “If you want a short-term solution, there is no solution.” Mr. Trump intensified his trade fight this week, imposing tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and threatening to tax nearly all imports from China if it dared to retaliate. His position has bewildered, frustrated and provoked Beijing, which has responded with its own levies on American goods. The diplomatic stalemate has many in the business and policy communities considering the possibility that the United States may be in a protracted and economically damaging trade fight for years to come and wondering what, if anything, America will gain. Kevin Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia and an expert on China, said in an interview that 2018 signaled “the beginnings of a war of a different type: a trade war, an investment war and a technology war between the two great powers of the 21st century, with an uncertain landing point.” Signs of fallout were already apparent: Mr. Ma backed off a pledge he had made in a meeting with Mr. Trump last year to create one million jobs in the United States, telling the Chinese news site Xinhua that “the promise was made on the premise of friendly U.S.-China partnership and rational trade relations,” a premise he said no longer exists. “Trade is not a weapon,” he said.

1744,"THE SCHOOLHOUSE GATE
Public Education, the Supreme Court, and the Battle for the American Mind
By Justin Driver
564 pp. Pantheon. $35. Do children who are undocumented immigrants have the right to a free public education? (They do.) Under what circumstances can teenagers be searched or suspended by school staff? (A very wide variety.) Can districts draw school zones in irregular shapes in order to achieve racial diversity in the classroom? (They can.) These are among the most divisive issues I’ve written about in a decade of education reporting. Indeed, they are among the most divisive issues in American life. And as Justin Driver explains in his indispensable “The Schoolhouse Gate: Public Education, the Supreme Court, and the Battle for the American Mind,” the highest court has ruled on each of these questions, profoundly shifting the American legal landscape not only in classrooms but outside of schools as well. Driver, a University of Chicago law professor and former clerk to Justices Stephen Breyer and Sandra Day O’Connor, offers a bold and ultimately persuasive argument: that despite the American tradition of local and state control of education, “schools should be deemed our most significant theaters of constitutional conflict.” He disdains what he calls the “Control+F” theory, which holds that because the Constitution does not mention education, constitutional law has little to say on the matter. “No other arena of constitutional decision making — not churches, not hotels, not hospitals, not restaurants, not police stations, not military bases, not automobiles, not even homes — comes close to matching the cultural import of the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence governing public schools,” Driver writes. For example, in two cases in the 1920s, the court protected minority rights by overturning an Oregon law supported by the Ku Klux Klan that banned private and parochial schools (often attended by Catholics and Jews) and one in Nebraska prohibiting teachers from conducting classes in foreign languages. In 2015, when Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote his opinion recognizing a right to same-sex marriage, he cited both of those nearly century-old decisions. "
1745,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: A Senate hearing scheduled for Monday to review allegations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court nominee is now in doubt. Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Judge Brett Kavanaugh of assaulting her at a high school party more than 30 years ago, said on Tuesday that she wanted the F.B.I. to investigate before she testifies. He has categorically denied her accusation. Republicans signaled that they would not postpone the hearing, and would either hold it without Dr. Blasey or declare it unnecessary if she refuses to appear. In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dr. Blasey’s lawyers said she had been the target of “vicious harassment and even death threats” since her identity had been made public. • A national debate: The accusations are being assessed under different social and cultural conventions than when the assault is said to have occurred. Our reporter looks at what has changed. "
1746,"“While on the surface it is the embryo’s fate that seems to be at stake,” the sociologist Kristin Luker wrote in 1984, “the abortion debate is actually about the meaning of women’s lives.” This line, from Luker’s book “Abortion and the Politics of Motherhood,” neatly encapsulates a longstanding pro-choice charge against the pro-life movement. As much as opponents of abortion claim to care about the killing of the unborn, the argument goes, in reality abortion restriction is a means to a different end: The restraint of women’s choices, the restriction of their sexual freedom, their subordination to the rule of fathers and husbands and patriarchy writ large. The reality has always been more complicated. From the beginning of the modern anti-abortion movement — whose origins lie in the 1960s, not just the aftermath of Roe v. Wade — it has included female leaders who identify as pro-life feminists and reject the idea that female liberty depends on a right to kill your unborn child. And while the pro-life grass roots tended to be strongly traditionalist on gender roles in the 1970s, with time pro-life and pro-choice citizens converged in their views on women’s roles; by the late 2000s, the Claremont McKenna professor Jon Shields wrote in a 2012 commentary on Luker’s book, a clear majority of pro-lifers voters held views that sociologists would describe as “gender egalitarian,” not traditionalist or Gileadean. At the same time the abortion-rights movement was linked in its early days to a distinctive form of upper-class WASP paternalism — in which legal abortion was sold as a means of helping upper-class “good girls” out of trouble while keeping the undesirable fertility of other classes and races in check. And from Hugh Hefner’s early abortion-rights advocacy to a certain style of predatory male feminism today, support for legal abortion among men has often carried a strong whiff of self-interest, with feticide as a get-out-of-responsibility-free card for caddish men. But with all this said, it’s also obvious that social conservatism can lapse into a version of Luker’s portrait, and it’s easy to think of examples — the Todd Akin fiasco of 2012, for instance — where a cruelly sexist form of anti-abortion politics reared an ugly head. Which is why the allegation of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh represents a uniquely dangerous moment for a pro-life movement that has spent decades working toward the goal of a fifth Supreme Court vote to amend or overturn Roe v. Wade. "
1747,"A view seems to have taken hold in Washington that the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford have let red-state Senate Democrats off the hook. These Democrats — chiefly Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the three Democrats who voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch in April 2017 — all face re-election in just seven weeks in states where President Trump is popular, and where majorities presumably would support Judge Kavanaugh’s elevation to the Supreme Court. But now, some say, the allegations against the nominee provide reason enough for them to vote no. Jim Manley, a former longtime Democratic Senate aide who knows these matters well, told Reuters on Tuesday: “For those Democrats up for re-election from states that Trump carried, they now have absolutely no reason to vote for Kavanaugh. Period. End of story. They have all the cover they need.” Several talking heads on cable news said much the same thing Tuesday. I’m not sure it’s that simple. Assuming Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination is not withdrawn and the Republicans continue to fight for him, these three Democrats and possibly one or two others will still find themselves in a tough position. In fact, if a couple of Republicans defect from Judge Kavanaugh, these Democrats will be in an even tougher spot than before. Imagine this hypothetical. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, the two Republican senators who are under the most pressure to oppose confirmation, decide to do so. That takes Judge Kavanaugh down to 49 votes. Game over. Except maybe not. At that point, Republicans, far from accepting defeat, will surely start aiming fire at the three Democrats. Their opponents will taunt them about Judge Kavanaugh on the campaign trail. Right-wing money will pour in to their states for pro-Kavanaugh (and pro-Trump) TV ads. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, will let this play out and may schedule the vote for as late as he can — mid-October, even late October — to make the Democrats sweat. That will constitute enormous pressure on the red-state Democrats. If they sense their opponents are gaining steam, they may well think: Why should I cast a vote that’s going to cost me my seat? Especially when even if we defeat Judge Kavanaugh, we’re just going to get someone else who’s every bit as conservative? "
1748,"GRACANICA, Kosovo — On highway signs in areas of Kosovo dominated by ethnic Albanians, the Serbian names of towns are ominously blacked out. Monuments to long-dead soldiers — Serb or ethnic Albanian, depending on where you are — line the roadways, often adorned with fresh flowers. It is rare to see the flag of Kosovo but common to see the colors of Serbia and Albania flying proudly. All along the roads in this small, bitterly contested land, drivers encounter reminders of how divided, and entangled, Kosovo’s ethnic groups remain, 10 years after the territory declared its independence from Serbia, its neighbor to the north. Now there is growing talk of making those divisions formal and partitioning Kosovo, essentially along ethnic lines. It is an idea the leaders of Kosovo and Serbia hope will settle lingering animosities 20 years after the two sides fought a war — and will be a step toward both of them joining the European Union. To the surprise of many, the Trump administration has signaled that it is open to the concept, even though a new Serbia-Kosovo border, drawn along ethnic lines, would concede the failure of decades of American policy to support an ethnically mixed, independent Kosovo. The mere suggestion of partition, with an accompanying swap of land, has inflamed fears that ethnic tensions would be reignited in a region where a series of wars killed more than 100,000 people and displaced millions in the 1990s.

The trade conflict between Washington and Beijing has escalated again: China retaliated against the latest U.S. tariffs, on $200 billion worth of imported Chinese goods, by adding its own levies on $60 billion worth of U.S. exports. But when will this tit-for-tat stop? Commentators on both sides of the Pacific fear it is the new normal. Timothy Stratford, a former assistant U.S. trade representative, told CNBC that “there’s going to be a deadlock for some time.” And Jack Ma, co-founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, believes it could go on for 20 years. That may sound melodramatic. But consider what Gary Hufbauer, of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Axios: More trade reading: Why Trump’s latest tariffs are particularly potent. Many consumers will feel pain, but retailers will feel it even sooner. China’s premier says the country won’t weaken its currency to boost exports. And why U.S. companies should get tough on Beijing. The company’s C.E.O. became the latest billionaire to save a storied media brand with his $190 million acquisition of Time. In his latest column, Andrew asks whether Mr. Benioff risks hurting the company and his shareholders if the magazine runs critical stories about President Trump. (See: Jeff Bezos and The Washington Post.) More from Andrew: Mr. Benioff told Andrew that he informed the board when he began thinking about buying Time, and emphasized that the magazine would be separate from Salesforce. But Mr. Bezos said the same thing about the Post. "
1750,"SEOUL, South Korea — Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader, told South Korea’s president on Wednesday that he would commit to some concrete steps toward denuclearization — including an offer to “permanently dismantle” facilities central to fuel production for nuclear warheads. But he made no promises to relinquish his nuclear weapons or missiles. Mr. Kim’s commitments fell far short of what American officials have demanded — a complete abandonment of the North’s nuclear and missile programs. Nonetheless, President Trump welcomed the agreements, reached during Mr. Kim’s summit meeting in North Korea with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, as “very exciting.” Speaking on the South Lawn of the White House, Mr. Trump told reporters that when he came into office “people thought we were going — it was inevitable — we were going to war with North Korea.” Despite Mr. Trump’s insistence that he remained tough on North Korea, three outcomes from the meeting between Mr. Moon and Mr. Kim suggested the White House had softened its position. Mr. Moon is pushing toward a peace declaration — a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War — that the United States will almost certainly join. Mr. Kim, only in his mid-30s but clearly a canny negotiator, has used the relationship with Mr. Moon to sidestep the American demand that he surrender all his nuclear capabilities first, and then negotiate. Instead, he is demanding reciprocal, step-by-step concessions from Mr. Trump — so far unspecified — and holding on to his nuclear weapons at least until he gets those allowances. "
1751,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. On March 22, Wilbur Ross — President Trump’s commerce secretary — appeared before a House committee. Before doing so, Ross took an oath to tell the truth. It seems clear that he then told a straight-up lie. “The Department of Justice, as you know, initiated the request for inclusion of the citizenship question,” Ross told the committee. He was referring to a much-debated question that the Trump administration was proposing to add to the 2020 census, asking people whether they were American citizens. The Commerce Department oversees the census. But the Justice Department, Ross claimed, “initiated” the question, because it believed that knowing where citizens lived could somehow help the federal government protect the voting rights of African-Americans. Let’s first pause for a moment on the absurdity of that explanation. The Trump administration and other Republican leaders have been trying in recent years to make it harder for minorities to vote, by closing polling places where they live, reducing voting hours and adding stringent I.D. requirements. And now Ross was suggesting that Jeff Sessions’s Justice Department — as New York magazine’s Eric Levitz points out — actually cared deeply about black voter turnout. All along, the real motivation for the citizenship question has been clear. Adding it would frighten some Latinos — including citizens — about responding to the census, worried that doing so could subject them to scrutiny from immigration authorities. An undercount of Latinos would then cause them to receive less political representation and federal funding — both of which are based on the census. Areas with few Latinos, which tend to lean Republican, would receive outsize Congressional power and outsize federal money. So we have known for months that Ross’s testimony was, at best, misleading. In July, The Washington Post gave him “four Pinocchios.” This week, we got the documentation that he told an outright lie — when he claimed the Justice Department “initiated” the citizenship question. "
1752,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) No other family has wielded as much influence over California as the Browns: Pat Brown served as governor over two terms beginning in 1959, while his son Jerry is now in his fourth term and second round as the top state official. But the family’s intertwining with California history did not begin there. In her new book, “The Browns of California: The Family Dynasty That Transformed a State and Shaped a Nation,” the journalist and historian Miriam Pawel traces the story of four generations. We spoke with Ms. Pawel to understand what history may tell us about the state today. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. Q. You write with the premise that the unique history of California as a whole can be told through the unique history of the Brown family. How did that idea come about? A. In 2015, the governor was talking a lot in public speeches about his great-grandfather, August Schuckman, who came across through the Plains in 1852 and settled in Colusa, on the land where Jerry Brown and his wife are building their retirement home. I was very struck by this and his belief that it was important to know that history, and that history was a guide. Q. Can you talk more about the difference between the eras that father and son governed in? A. Pat Brown proudly presided over California during a time of phenomenal growth — every day, for a decade, 1,000 people a day moved here, and another 1,000 babies were born. He felt the urgency to provide water, schools, roads and colleges for current and future Californians. He governed with exuberance and a faith that unlimited resources would build the largest, greatest state in the country. By the time his son took office in 1975, only eight years after Pat Brown had been defeated by Ronald Reagan, bigger was no longer better. Smog, traffic, budget deficits, a recession, a drought, student protests, racial unrest had all changed the complexion of California. "
1753,"WASHINGTON — President Trump excoriated on Wednesday his attorney general, the F.B.I., the special counsel and members of the intelligence community — citing conspiracy theories by conservatives even as he declared in a wide-ranging interview that he is “not a conspiratorial person.” Mr. Trump used the Oval Office interview with The Hill newspaper to unleash some of his most deeply felt grievances against his critics, saying that one of the “crowning achievements” of his presidency will be exposing what he calls corruption among the people investigating his administration. “We have tremendous support, by the way, to expose something that is truly a cancer in our country,” the president said of federal law enforcement officials without citing evidence. The remark was a striking rhetorical echo of 1973, when John Dean, the White House counsel, gravely told President Richard M. Nixon that the Watergate scandal was “a cancer within — close to the presidency.” By contrast, Mr. Trump compared his repeated trashing of F.B.I. investigators to congressional passage of tax cuts and the elimination of regulations by his administration, saying that “what we’ve done is a great service to the country, really.” The president’s antipathy toward the intelligence community and the Justice Department has been clear for most of his time in the White House. But Mr. Trump’s verbal assault on his own law enforcement agencies during Tuesday’s interview was remarkable even by his standards. Mr. Trump made false assertions about the origins of the Russia investigation and the political makeup of its investigators, citing stories from Fox News personalities: “the great Lou Dobbs, the great Sean Hannity, the wonderful, great Jeanine Pirro.” "
1754,"During World War II, the Finnish government evacuated about 70,000 children to protect them from the danger, stress and uncertainty of war. Their parents agreed to send them to foster homes primarily in Sweden. It was one of the largest evacuations of children in the 20th century. And years later, some would consider the program a grave mistake. After the fighting stopped in 1945, the children began to return home. Beginning in the mid-1990s, scientists at the University of Helsinki caught up with some of these “war children,” now elderly adults, to examine how, if at all, the childhood separation from their parents had affected their health and well-being. This research, which is ongoing, helps us understand the long-term consequences of another mass separation of children from their parents — the one orchestrated by the Trump administration. More than 2,500 migrant children were taken from their parents and detained. Most have since been reunited, but 12,800 migrant children — a record, as we learned last week — remain in detention. Many are teenagers who crossed the border unaccompanied. In the past they typically would have been released in a timely fashion to sponsors — often parents or other family members who’d come here before them — but no longer. How will this continued separation affect them? Judging from the Finnish experience, it may make the younger kids among them in particular sicker, stunt their cognitive development, and increase their risk of mental health problems for decades to come. The Finnish children ranged from babies to 9-year-olds. Some were separated from their parents for more than six years, some for less than one; the average was nearly two years. Men evacuated as children, Finnish scientists found, were more likely to have mental health and substance abuse problems than men who weren’t. Both sexes were more likely to suffer from depression if separated. "
1755,"WASHINGTON — The sexual assault accusation against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh hasn’t just upended what was expected to be his relatively easy Senate confirmation to the Supreme Court. The allegation has also scrambled the political calculations for 10 Democratic senators running for re-election in states won by President Trump, particularly three moderate Democrats who had been weighing a yes vote. Few politicians have a greater stake in Judge Kavanaugh’s fate than these 10 senators who are trying to appeal to red-state voters back home, and whose re-election bids will determine whether Democrats win control of the narrowly divided chamber in November. Before Christine Blasey Ford accused Judge Kavanaugh of assaulting her when they were teenagers, many of these senators were simply happy that the Kavanaugh nomination hadn’t become a rallying cry for the conservative base. They hoped they could vote no without political consequences, because he was so likely to be confirmed with Republican votes, and then move on to more favorable terrain. And for three of the most moderate Senate Democrats — Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana — the nomination represented an opportunity for them to vote yes on Judge Kavanaugh and demonstrate independence from their party and deny Republicans an issue in the fall campaign. The three had previously supported President Trump’s first nominee for the court, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. But Dr. Blasey’s accusation is now leading Senate Democrats to assess whether she has given them an easy pass to vote no on his nomination — or if they could face controversy over a 36-year-old allegation that they would rather not deal with in the midterm campaign.

1756,"LONDON — As brand names for high-rise towers, hotels or golf courses go, it is hard to trump Trump. But what about Fort Trump, the supposedly tongue-in-cheek name President Andrzej Duda of Poland has proposed for an American military base in his country? The Polish leader discussed that proposal with President Trump at the White House on Tuesday, trying to get traction for an idea his government has been pushing for months to deter any possible Russian aggression. The Polish government has even been willing to pay — to the tune of $2 billion. Of course, Mr. Duda was not the first European leader to seek to curry favor with Mr. Trump by appealing to his sense of self — or by injecting an element of flattery into the geopolitics of the day. Britain lured Mr. Trump this year with an invitation to have tea with Queen Elizabeth II. (The visit finally took place in July, but protests from Britons forced the organizers to offer a limited program that did not include the full panoply of a traditional state visit.) President Emmanuel Macron of France invited Mr. Trump to be at his side last year during the annual July 14 parade along the Champs-Élysées in Paris — an event that so impressed the American leader that he ordered a similar parade in the United States for Veterans Day. In August, he canceled those plans, citing costs. But Mr. Duda’s comments in Washington seem to have brought little praise at home, where critics castigated him on Wednesday for what they depicted as craven behavior. "
1757,"“This is a start-up,” Marc Benioff told me loudly over FaceTime, leaning in and out of the frame on a bumpy ride to the airport. “They have been opportunity constrained,” he said, “but we are here to unshackle them.” Was the billionaire founder and chief executive of Salesforce, the digital enterprise hotshot of San Francisco, talking about a new bitcoin company he was interested in investing in? Or perhaps a big opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a cool artificial intelligence start-up? No. Mr. Benioff was enthusiastically touting one of the oldest and most storied publications in the United States, which he and his wife, Lynne, had just forked over $190 million in cash to buy. [Watch Kara Swisher’s Twitter Q&A about her column. Part I; Part II] That would be Time magazine, of course. It was indeed a start-up once — back in 1923, when it was founded by Briton Hadden and Henry Luce as the first weekly newsmagazine in the United States. After dominating journalism for quite a lot of the 20th century, the title fell on hard times in the internet age. Its owner, Time Warner, tried. Remember Pathfinder, its ill-conceived online portal? What about the AOL-Time Warner merger, designed to be the spectacular marriage of analog and digital but fated to be one of the worst ever? After endless corporate restructurings, management upheavals and sales, last year Time Inc. ended up with Meredith Corporation in a $2.8 billion all-cash deal. Then Meredith turned around and started peddling off the parts it did not want. That included Time, as well as Sports Illustrated and Fortune. "
1758,"NEW BERN, N.C. — In this gracious riverfront town, where the waters rose with frightening swiftness last week to submerge entire neighborhoods, President Trump gazed in wonder on Wednesday at an elegant yacht that had been washed ashore during Hurricane Florence and now lay shipwrecked against the back deck of a red brick house. “Is this your boat?” Mr. Trump asked the homeowner. When the man shook his head and said “No,” the president turned with a grin and replied, “At least you got a nice boat out of the deal.” It was an offhand, if telling, moment on the first leg of Mr. Trump’s trip to the storm-tossed Carolinas — a day in which he found a young apprentice to help hand out box lunches, commiserated with storm victims about their insurance claims, and inspected a landscape rudely transformed by howling winds, historic rains and swollen rivers. Where other presidents have treated natural disaster tours as dignified, even grave affairs, Mr. Trump has deployed sardonic humor, a candidate’s pep-rally enthusiasm and a real estate developer’s talent for always finding a silver lining. Occasionally, as when he tossed rolls of paper towels to storm victims in Puerto Rico last October, he has gone badly off-key. Arriving in the soggy aftermath of Hurricane Florence, which has proved more devastating than the storm itself, he followed much of that script. Sixteen rivers in North Carolina are in major flood stage, according to the state’s governor, Roy Cooper, with critical highways impassable and the city of Wilmington still largely cut off from the outside world by floodwaters. "
1759,"HOUSTON — When President Trump announced in May that he was going to withdraw the United States from the nuclear agreement that the Obama administration and five other countries negotiated with Iran in 2015 and reimpose sanctions on the country, the decision was fraught with potential disaster. If Mr. Trump’s approach worked too well, oil prices would spike and hurt the American economy. If it failed, international companies would continue trading with Iran, leaving the Islamic Republic unscathed, defiant and free to restart its nuclear program. But the policy has been effective without either of those nasty consequences, at least so far. Nearly two months before American oil sanctions go into effect, Iran’s crude exports are plummeting. International oil companies, including those from countries that are still committed to the nuclear agreement, are bailing out of deals with Tehran. And remarkably, the price of oil in the United States has risen only modestly while gasoline prices have essentially remained flat. The current global oil price hovers around $80 a barrel, $60 below the highs of a decade ago. “The president is doing the opposite of what the experts said, and it seems to be working out,” said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research, a research and consulting firm. Initial signs of a foreign-policy success could benefit Mr. Trump politically as Republicans try to hold on to control of Congress. The president and lawmakers allied with him could point to the administration’s aggressive stand toward Iran as evidence that his unconventional approach to diplomacy has been much more fruitful and far less costly than Democrats have been willing to acknowledge.

1760,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Over the past two years, the world has tried to absorb the details of Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. But the narrative is a confusing tangle of unfamiliar names and cyberjargon, further obscured by the shout-fest of partisan politics. So our reporters have unraveled the story so far in a special report, from the hacked emails and possible espionage to President Trump’s claims that it’s all a hoax. _____ "
1761,"Worried their chance to cement a conservative majority on the Supreme Court could slip away, a growing number of evangelical and anti-abortion leaders are expressing frustration that Senate Republicans and the White House are not protecting Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh more forcefully from a sexual assault allegation and warning that conservative voters may stay home in November if his nomination falls apart. Several of these leaders, including ones with close ties to the White House and Senate Republicans, are urging Republicans to move forward with a confirmation vote imminently unless the woman who accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexual assault, Christine Blasey Ford, agrees to share her story with the Senate Judiciary Committee within the next few days. Dr. Blasey’s lawyers told the committee Thursday that she was willing to testify next week, pending negotiations over “terms that are fair,” but not on Monday as Senate Republicans had wanted. The evangelical leaders’ pleas are, in part, an attempt to apply political pressure: Some of them are warning that religious conservatives may feel little motivation to vote in the midterm elections unless Senate Republicans move the nomination out of committee soon and do more to defend Judge Kavanaugh from what they say is a desperate Democratic ploy to prevent President Trump from filling future court vacancies. “One of the political costs of failing to confirm Brett Kavanaugh is likely the loss of the United States Senate,” said Ralph Reed, the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition who is in frequent contact with the White House. “If Republicans were to fail to defend and confirm such an obviously and eminently qualified and decent nominee,” Mr. Reed added, “then it will be very difficult to motivate and energize faith-based and conservative voters in November.” "
1762,"Some states and congressional districts are a lot harder to poll than others, and this can have major consequences. Take Wisconsin. The polls there were misleading in 2016. Hillary Clinton, apparently feeling she had a secure lead, didn’t even campaign in the state. The Wisconsin polls probably underestimated the number of white voters without a college degree, or missed the undecided voters breaking for Donald J. Trump. Those were problems in many states, but might have been particularly bad in Wisconsin, which has a big share of white working-class voters. But as we’ve been reminded while conducting New York Times Upshot/Siena College polling in recent weeks, the state also has one of the nation’s least helpful voter registration files. These are the foundation of modern campaign polling: a data set of every registered voter. In general, pollsters use data from voter files to ensure that their samples are representative — by having the right number of younger voters or older voters, for example, or Democrats or Republicans. Without that information, polling becomes a lot more difficult. In Wisconsin, pollsters have less data to work with. "
1763,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Ever since the days when Angelenos sold tamales out of horse-drawn carts, street food has been a fixture in this city. It has also been illegal, even as taco carts and fruit stands with their familiar rainbow umbrellas have been mainstays on street corners. Vendors — mostly immigrants, many undocumented — have faced fines, misdemeanor criminal charges and, increasingly in the Trump era, the threat of deportation. For years, activists have pushed to legalize street vending in Los Angeles, and city officials were close to doing so. But this week Gov. Jerry Brown beat them to it, signing a law that decriminalized street vendors across California. “It’s really a big deal for vendors across the state,” said Carla De Paz, an organizer in Los Angeles on behalf of vendors. “There’s a lot of undocumented workers who are facing the fear of deportation, especially in our current political climate.” Street vending here has always been bound up with issues of race and class, as well as the nature of the urban landscape of Los Angeles — its sprawl, the centrality of the automobile and debates about how public spaces are used. And in the last two years, the administration’s crackdown on immigration gave new urgency to the push to legalize street sellers. Activists here made the argument that protecting immigrant street vendors was an important step for the city in pushing back against the president’s agenda. "
1764,"Michael Moore began his filmmaking career with an investigative passion and a flair for showmanship. His 1989 debut feature, “Roger & Me,” used the funny populist hook of Mr. Moore, in his working-class Everyman persona, pursuing Roger B. Smith, the then-head of General Motors, to confront him about the company’s abandonment of Mr. Moore’s hometown, Flint, Mich. In his new documentary, “Fahrenheit 11/9,” Mr. Moore, his sense of showmanship not only intact but enhanced by a bigger production budget, fills a water truck with the same supply that’s piped to Flint residents for drinking and bathing. This water is famously polluted with lead (among other toxins), in a yearslong scandal that’s still not come to a satisfactory conclusion. (“No terrorist organization has figured out how to poison an entire American city,” Mr. Moore notes in voice-over. “It took the Michigan Republican Party to pull that off.”) He drives the truck to the home of the most powerful Republican in Michigan, Gov. Rick Snyder, and waters his lawn with it. For Mr. Moore, the situation in Flint is a microcosm of the disaster he sees President Trump imposing on this country. The movie begins with a 2016 election “how did this happen?” montage, making clear that the cycle of instant news followed by the internet’s instant reaction has diluted the immediacy of Mr. Moore’s canny cinematic storytelling — it was a lot of stuff I’d heard and seen before.

In January 2017, the Alibaba co-founder stood beside Donald Trump, then the president-elect, and pledged to help create one million U.S. jobs. Mr. Ma now says that’s impossible. Speaking to Xinhua, China’s state news agency, Mr. Ma said that his promise “was made on the premise of friendly U.S.-China partnership and rational trade relations.” With Washington and Beijing firmly locked in a trade dispute, those conditions don’t exist. Mr. Ma isn’t alone in making a U-turn over the trade fight. The Chinese consumer goods company Haier suspended plans to sell G.E.-branded appliances in China. Zhang Ruimin, Haier’s C.E.O., told the FT: “I think Chinese consumers are most interested in [G.E.] kitchen products. But the U.S. government thought differently.” More trade news: Beijing plans to cut tariffs on non-U.S. imports. Moving iPhone production to the U.S. wouldn’t be much of a victory for Mr. Trump.

1766,"As the Democratic electorate has bifurcated along economic and racial lines, intraparty tension is rising. One manifestation of this tension is the eruption of competition over access to high performance magnet schools in heavily Democratic metropolitan areas like Washington and New York. Take, for example, an initiative to change the role of ability testing in admitting students to public school programs for the gifted by administrators in Montgomery County, Maryland. The county, which lies in suburban Washington, is overwhelmingly Democratic (Clinton 77.7 percent to Trump 19.4 percent) — and affluent (median household income $100,352). In an effort to expand openings for low-income and minority students, the Montgomery County school district “now gives less weight to the Cognitive Abilities Test, a common assessment for admission to gifted programs, and more to class performance,” Dana Goldstein reported earlier this month in The Times. The county The new policies are not universally welcome. As Goldstein writes, At the same time, Kimberly Petrola, a teacher at Fox Chapel Elementary School in Germantown, one of the local Centers for Enriched Studies, told Goldstein: In New York, the mayor, Bill de Blasio and Richard A. Carranza, chancellor of the city schools, are promoting a similar reform — an issue I touched on in an earlier column. “Right now, we are living with monumental injustice,” de Blasio wrote in a blog post in June: De Blasio would replace the test that currently determines entry to the city’s eight high performance elite high schools, the Specialized High School Admissions Test. In its place, de Blasio proposes a new admissions process for the eight schools “based on a combination of the student’s rank in their middle school and their results in the statewide tests that all middle school children take.” The proposal produced outrage in some quarters, especially in Asian communities. Asian students currently make up 16 percent of the total public school enrollment in New York City but they make up 62 percent of the students in the eight elite high schools. Whites are 15 percent of total enrollment, but 24 percent of the students in these schools. "
1767,"KNOXVILLE, Iowa — We keep hearing about Democratic women of color winning races in the Bronx, Georgia, Boston and other places with a diverse population. But here in mostly white Iowa, we’ve got our own story to tell. Part of that story is it’s not just diverse urban areas where a person of color can run for statewide office. Here in Iowa, 32-year-old Deidre DeJear, an African-American small-business owner, is the Democratic nominee for secretary of state. If Ms. DeJear beats the Republican incumbent, Paul Pate, in November, she’ll become the first African-American to win statewide office in Iowa. About 91 percent of Iowans are white; only about 4 percent are African-American. Iowa is bipolar with respect to politics and race. Barack Obama won our first-in-the-nation Democratic caucuses in 2008 to help propel him to his two-term presidency. In 2016, Donald Trump almost won, and his second-place finish in the crowded Republican caucuses proved to the rest of the nation he was a viable candidate. Similar racial dynamics play out in races for lower offices. The rural Fourth District’s congressman is Steve King, an anti-immigration, anti-multiculturalism Republican congressman who questions the cultural contributions of nonwhites, endorses white nationalism, compared immigrants to dogs and until last year had a Confederate flag on his desk. He retweets white supremacists. But then here is Ms. DeJear, who nearly every day engages many of the rural voters who supported Mr. Trump and Mr. King. She is part of Iowa’s contribution to a wave of women running for office nationally, and one of a record number of over 600 black women running. Race does not play a big role in Ms. DeJear’s campaign. “When I talk to Iowans,” she told me, “it’s about values — of course people see I’m black, and that I’m a woman, but ultimately it’s values that matter to people.” "

Here’s what you need to know: For two years, Americans have learned details of Russia’s intervention in the 2016 election: hacked and leaked emails, widespread fraud on social media, overtures from people suspected of being Kremlin spies, and allegations of conspiracy. The clamor of partisan politics has taken a toll on public comprehension and confidence, as has President Trump’s frequent claim that Russian interference is all a “hoax.” This morning, The Times published a special report with a full timeline exploring what has been learned, and what it all means.

1769,"For years, Dale and Hannah Laplace lived together, as twins often do. They grew up on a horse farm in upstate New York and shared a two-bedroom off-campus apartment at Seton Hall University, in South Orange, N.J. After college, they split up for a few years and then reunited to share a two-bedroom, along with Milly the cat, in one of Hoboken’s newer rental buildings, enjoying a postcard view of Manhattan. Both commuted to work in New York on the PATH train. Preferring a building with more amenities and a neighborhood with fewer rowdy bars, they moved to a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment in the towering M2 at Marbella, in Jersey City, which opened in 2016 with some 300 units. They each paid around $2,300 a month, getting another great view from one of the highest floors. Dale had the master bedroom, with a big closet, and Hannah had the smaller bedroom and the main bathroom, so big “you could do cartwheels in it,” she said. The two raided each other’s closets and ate dinner together when they could. The twins, who are now 31, planned to move when the lease expired, frustrated by the building’s chronic elevator issues. One memorable night, with none of the elevators working, Hannah hoofed it up to the 35th floor. She had to walk down the next morning. “That is not something I ever wanted to experience again,” she said. “Walking down was almost as bad because I got dizzy.” (A building spokeswoman responded: “Our average wait time is on par with other apartment towers of similar size. The comfort of our residents is always our top priority, and we will continue to perform routine maintenance to ensure the system is performing optimally.”) "
1770,"Right about this time of year is when the literary world would normally be praising, bemoaning or just scratching its collective head over the latest winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature. Alas, this year’s prize has been “postponed” (two will be awarded in 2019) because of a sex abuse scandal in the august halls of the Swedish Academy, which hands out the award. That scandal is being covered elsewhere in this newspaper. But to help fill the void of conversation around the prize itself, I recently spoke with The New York Times’s staff book critics — Dwight Garner, Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai — about what the prize has meant (or not meant) to their own reading habits; their opinions of past winners (and past snubs); and whom they would bestow the honor upon this year if they could. — John Williams Will you miss the awarding of the prize this year? Has it meant anything to you in the past? Have you ever discovered a writer’s work because of it? PARUL SEHGAL Well, this is awkward. I fully intended to say that I was indifferent to the charade of the Nobel; that it’s madness to believe that literary excellence can be conferred by committee. Adam Kirsch has a good line about the Swedish Academy being the Politburo of literature. But when I sat down to write, what did I see on the bookshelf across from me but my wizened copy of Kenzaburo Oe’s “A Personal Matter.” And below it, Yasunari Kawabata’s wonderfully licentious “House of the Sleeping Beauties and Other Stories.” Somewhere in these stacks are also Heinrich Böll’s “Billiards at Half-Past Nine” (which I only pretended to read) and his “Group Portrait With Lady” (which I loved). I like to believe that I would have found these books anyway, but how long would I have had to wait? As it was, they found me, when I was growing up outside of the “literary centers” of the world (like most people). I remember being young and feeling very much at the margins, desperately curious about the world and not knowing where to look. The Nobel — imperfect as any human endeavor — shone a light. "
1771,"SEOUL, South Korea — President Moon Jae-in of South Korea urged the United States on Thursday to declare an end to the Korean War as an incentive for North Korea to denuclearize, a call that could put the Trump administration in a bind as it tries to revive stalled talks with Kim Jong-un, the North’s leader. Mr. Moon said that during his landmark three-day summit meeting with Mr. Kim this week, the North’s leader had repeatedly expressed willingness to give up his nuclear weapons quickly and to build new relations with Washington. “He again and again reaffirmed his commitment to denuclearization,” Mr. Moon said at a news conference in Seoul, the South’s capital, after returning from North Korea. “He said he wanted to achieve complete denuclearization as soon as possible and focus on economic development.” To “expedite denuclearization,” Mr. Moon said, Mr. Kim also hopes to meet Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, and to hold a second meeting with President Trump as soon as possible. Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim first met in Singapore in June. One of the first steps Mr. Kim wants to take before moving toward denuclearization, Mr. Moon said, is to secure a joint statement declaring an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, which was halted only with an armistice. "
1772,"TOKYO — Prime Minister Shinzo Abe won a commanding victory in a vote for the leadership of Japan’s governing party on Thursday, moving him closer to his dream of becoming the longest-serving prime minister in the country’s history and fueling his hopes of revising its pacifist Constitution. Mr. Abe’s win over a single challenger came despite the headwinds he faced from domestic political scandals, stagnant wages and his declining influence with President Trump, particularly in negotiations over North Korea’s nuclear program. The victory gives Mr. Abe, 63, a new three-year term as president of the Liberal Democratic Party and assures him of remaining prime minister. If he remains in office until November 2019 — just short of seven years after he was elected in December 2012 — he will surpass the previous longevity record for prime minister, set during the Meiji era in the early 20th century by Taro Katsura. Mr. Abe faces a full slate of challenges, including towering national debt, the increasing threat of climate change-related disasters, a rapidly aging society and the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. “Cooperating with you, I’d like to do my best to hand over to our children’s generation a Japan filled with hope and pride,” Mr. Abe said in his acceptance speech. Above all, analysts said, Mr. Abe’s signature accomplishment is his stable political leadership in a country that had grown weary of a conveyor belt of prime ministers. Since World War II, the average tenure of Japanese prime ministers has been about two years. By the end of next year, Mr. Abe would exceed Mr. Katsura’s almost eight years in office because Mr. Abe’s tenure includes an earlier stint as prime minister. "

1774,"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. As the Trump-Russia story plays out over weeks and months, it is easy to get lost in the blizzard of media revelations, indictments and angry presidential tweets. That’s where we come in. It’s actually been our job to keep up with this sprawling affair since it began. We have shared dozens of bylines over the years — covering drones and torture and covert operations — but this story has eclipsed the others in terms of its scope and dizzying complexity. Any long-running investigation develops its own cast of characters, its own jargon and catchphrases. As Watergate unfolded, there were Mitchell, Haldeman, Dean, Magruder, Hunt; the “modified, limited hangout,” a cover-up formula agreed upon between President Richard M. Nixon and his aides; and the “18 ½-minute gap” on a White House tape. And, of course, the president’s famed “I am not a crook.” In this story, there are Manafort, Flynn, Papadopoulos, Page, Stone; the Internet Research Agency and the G.R.U., “collusion” and “Putin’s niece”; and President Trump’s recurring protests, with his signature Twitter capitalization, about a “Hoax” and “Witch Hunt.” Last month, considering what might help readers keep it all straight, Times editors recalled that The New York Times Magazine had published two special issues devoted entirely to recounting the Watergate affair: “The Story So Far,” in July 1973, and “The Story Continued,” the following January. They were written by one of the great journalistic storytellers of the era, J. Anthony Lukas, who did months of reporting and drew on the voluminous Senate Watergate hearings to retrace and assess the scandal that would end the Nixon presidency. We have attempted something similar, on a more modest scale, for a special section in today’s Times. For readers who find that “breaking news” alerts do not always clarify the state of play, and those who feel overwhelmed by developments hashed over during a 24-hour news cycle — something that didn’t exist during the Watergate era — we have tried to sketch the major developments in Russia’s targeting of the 2016 presidential election: its historic significance, its motives and its effects. We were particularly focused on how two narratives — the story of the Russian attack and the story of Mr. Trump’s quest for the presidency — intersected over several months in 2016. Our colleagues have produced a meticulous timeline that captures the details. "

1776,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A Brexit meeting, a look inside Facebook’s election “War Room” and Kosovo’s ethnic divide. Here’s the latest: • “Blind Brexit” may be better than none. After months of wrangling over Britain’s departure from the E.U., leaders are meeting in Salzburg, Austria, hoping to reach a compromise. “The prospect of a vague Brexit, with only a slim-line political declaration about the future E.U.-U.K. relationship published alongside a legally binding withdrawal agreement is gaining ground,” one analyst said. That solution now has a nickname: Blind Brexit. After dinner at the summit meeting last night, though, officials suggested a deal remains far away. _____ • President Trump comments on two storms.

1777,"When the Metropolitan Opera opens its season on Monday evening, well-heeled patrons ascending the building’s sweeping dual staircase may recognize bits of themselves and their dramatic surroundings in Cecily Brown’s two huge paintings, stretching more than 9 by 25 feet, at the top of each landing. Though the loose, gestural brushwork seems abstract, on closer inspection it coalesces into jostling figures, only to break apart again into fragments. Black bow ties pop out from the crowd, and then faces and dinner jackets start to come into focus. “There’s an awful lot of groping going on,” said Ms. Brown, the acclaimed British-born artist, lithe and animated in her New York studio. “As you come up, it’s almost that you enter into the painting, and the crowd will be mirrored. People think my work is abstract, but I always see it as teeming with figures — here more than usual.” This is the first time since the Metropolitan Opera opened its doors in 1966, and Marc Chagall unveiled his two site-specific murals — “The Triumph of Music” and “The Sources of Music” — that an artist has been invited to make and exhibit work inside the main hall of the opera house. Ms. Brown, 49, is part of a small club of female artists with work commanding seven figures. This is her first public project in a space that isn’t a museum. “She’s created a bonfire of the vanities — that kind of excitement, passion and tragedy,” said Dodie Kazanjian, founding director of Gallery Met, the nonprofit contemporary-art space at the Metropolitan Opera, who tapped Ms. Brown to make the paintings. “It’s got all the emotions in it of what opera brings out.” The paintings, both titled “Triumph of the Vanities,” will be on view through next summer. Since Gallery Met, the white-box space for artist projects at the south end of the lobby, is being reconfigured by Ennead Architects as a new entrance for patrons and subscribers, to ease congestion at the lobby doorway, the Met’s general manager, Peter Gelb, has let Ms. Kazanjian bring it directly into the opera house. She will choose an artist every year to take on the majestic front of the house — now open to the public for limited hours during weekdays and Sundays. "
1778,"“What kind of big fan were you?” the writer John D’Agata asked as he sat in a cozy booth in a sunny midtown Manhattan diner. “Were you a” — pause — “hater” — pause — “big fan?” I’d just told Mr. D’Agata how much I’d enjoyed his 2012 book, “The Lifespan of a Fact,” which he wrote with Jim Fingal, seated to his right. I hadn’t realized I’d hit a nerve. In 2005, then working as an unpaid intern for the San Francisco magazine The Believer, Mr. Fingal was assigned to fact-check an essay by Mr. D’Agata, a celebrated creative-nonfiction writer. Theoretically, unremarkable. In practice, a dramatic enough tale to birth first the book and, now, a Broadway adaptation starring Bobby Cannavale, Daniel Radcliffe, and Cherry Jones, which starts previews Sept. 20 at Studio 54. And dramatic enough to render Mr. D’Agata a villain. His original article was a lovely, meditative essay on the suicide of Levi Presley, a Las Vegas teenager who jumped off the observation deck of the Stratosphere Tower in the summer of 2002. The aim was to write a piece explicating the feel, if not so much the literal exact truth, of a city’s sadness. Mr. Fingal was then a recent Harvard graduate crashing on his brother’s futon in Mountain View, Calif., and starving for a challenge. His fact-checking document bloomed into a breathless 90-page chronicle of the essay’s every last inaccuracy. He pulled lengthy testimonials from linguistics-expert pals pushing back on Mr. D’Agata’s flourishes; he made his own solo reporting trip to the Vegas strip to double-check the colors of the bricks at the base of the Stratosphere. The fact-checker, a presumably mild-mannered figure, suddenly took on the menace of an interrogator. Which goes a way toward explaining how a slim, odd little book about fact-checking made it to Broadway in the first place. There is an inherent extremism in the work that can, at times, feel insane.

1779,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. Republicans are resisting calls for the F.B.I. to investigate an accusation that Judge Brett Kavanaugh committed sexual assault as a teenager. The accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, has said she wants an inquiry to take place before she testifies at Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing. On “Full Frontal,” Samantha Bee said the process was bringing back memories of Anita Hill’s testimony at Justice Clarence Thomas’s confirmation hearings in 1991 — and Bee was not enjoying the déjà vu. Some lawmakers and commentators have said Blasey’s accusation is immaterial because the alleged assault took place when Kavanaugh was 17. But Bee pushed back hard on that. Kevin Hart joined Jimmy Fallon as a co-host of “The Tonight Show” on Wednesday, and their shared monologue devolved almost immediately into good, old-fashioned insult comedy. Here are some of the best burns of the rib roast. "
1780,"YABUCOA, P.R. — The morning on Thursday was quieter than it was a year ago in this small farming town on the southeast coast of Puerto Rico. The sound of waves crashing against the cliffs filled the air. The distinctive mating call of coquís, the native mountain frogs of the island, whistled in the trees as the sun rose and fused the Caribbean horizon with hues of orange and purple. Then, at 6:15 a.m., a sonorous voice rose above the morning hum: “I am the light of the morning that shines new paths, that floods the mountains, and the peasant trails …” The singer, Alberto Carrión, intoned Spanish verses from a seaside cliff at exactly the same time and in the same town where Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico a year ago, on Sept. 20. Instead of the howling winds of last year, Puerto Ricans woke to the heartening lyrics of “Amanecer borincano” — “Puerto Rican Sunrise” — in a performance that was televised and live-streamed across the island to commemorate the anniversary. [A year after Hurricane Maria, read how thousands of homes are still in ruins.] “It talks about a new sunrise in Puerto Rico and about having hope,” said Mr. Carrión, a popular Puerto Rican songwriter who was joined by a choir of students from the University of Puerto Rico. “Maria hit us hard, but we’re even stronger and we’ll overcome this.” "
1781,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] On Sunday, Christine Blasey Ford was a lone voice telling her story. Four days later, she might be the only person not telling her story. Politics has a way of chewing people up and leaving their lives almost unrecognizable. But the speed and aggression by which both parties have transformed Dr. Blasey’s #MeToo story into a political football has been striking. On Capitol Hill, Democrats are calling for an F.B.I. investigation. Republicans are rejecting that, and want to question her instead. As of Thursday night, they’re negotiating, with Dr. Blasey’s lawyer ruling out a Monday hearing but saying she’d be open to testify next week. So far, Dr. Blasey has been silent, communicating only through her lawyers. We know that Dr. Blasey understood that telling her story came with risks. She told the Washington Post that she held off going public because of concerns about what it would mean for her family. Katherine Kendall, one of the first women to come forward with accusations against Harvey Weinstein, told me that she was unprepared for the onslaught of media attention and the way her story would be challenged. Ms. Kendall attended private school in Washington around the same time as Dr. Blasey, and she said that while they didn’t know each other, their worlds were likely very similar. The scrutiny on Dr. Blasey is more intense than what Ms. Kendall faced, because it involves not just power and money but politics, too. The stakes are enormous: The outcome of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing will set the direction of the Supreme Court for a generation. "
1782,"Editors’ Note [Dec. 18, 2020]: In 2018, The Times released a 12-part narrative podcast series called “Caliphate” on the Islamic State terrorist group and its operations. While parts of the series involved a broad examination of the group’s tactics and influence, multiple episodes were driven primarily by the confessional tale of a Canadian man of Pakistani origin who called himself Abu Huzayfah and claimed to have been a member of the Islamic State who had taken part in killings in Syria.

During the course of reporting for the series, The Times discovered significant falsehoods and other discrepancies in Huzayfah’s story. The Times took a number of steps, including seeking confirmation of details from intelligence officials in the United States, to find independent evidence of Huzayfah’s story. The decision was made to proceed with the project but to include an episode, Chapter 6, devoted to exploring major discrepancies and highlighting the fact-checking process that sought to verify key elements of the narrative. In September — two and a half years after the podcast was released — the Canadian police arrested Huzayfah, whose real name is Shehroze Chaudhry, and charged him with perpetrating a terrorist hoax. Canadian officials say they believe that Mr. Chaudhry’s account of supposed terrorist activity is completely fabricated. The hoax charge led The Times to investigate what Canadian officials had discovered, and to re-examine Mr. Chaudhry’s account and the earlier efforts to determine its validity. This new examination found a history of misrepresentations by Mr. Chaudhry and no corroboration that he committed the atrocities he described in the “Caliphate” podcast. As a result, The Times has concluded that the episodes of “Caliphate” that presented Mr. Chaudhry’s claims did not meet our standards for accuracy. From the outset, “Caliphate” should have had the regular participation of an editor experienced in the subject matter. In addition, The Times should have pressed harder to verify Mr. Chaudhry’s claims before deciding to place so much emphasis on one individual’s account. For example, reporters and editors could have vetted more thoroughly materials Mr. Chaudhry provided for evidence that he had traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State, and pushed harder and earlier to determine what the authorities knew about him. It is also clear that elements of the original fact-checking process were not sufficiently rigorous: Times journalists were too credulous about the verification steps that were undertaken and dismissive of the lack of corroboration of essential aspects of Mr. Chaudhry’s account. In the absence of firmer evidence, “Caliphate” should have been substantially revised to exclude the material related to Mr. Chaudhry. The podcast as a whole should not have been produced with Mr. Chaudhry as a central narrative character. A fuller description of what The Times has learned about Mr. Chaudhry was published on Dec. 18, 2020. "
1783,"Of all the scandals swirling around the Trump White House, the Republican fund-raiser Elliott Broidy is in a category of his own. Documents from the office of the president’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, revealed that Mr. Broidy had agreed to pay $1.6 million to a former Playboy model to keep her quiet about their affair, which led her to get an abortion. And emails stolen from his account showed he had used his White House access on behalf of the rulers of the United Arab Emirates while landing hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts with them for his private defense company. Mr. Broidy, though, is not going quietly. His lawyers said this week that, after more than 80 subpoenas and months of forensic analysis, they had managed to identify as many as 1,200 other individuals targeted by the same cybercriminals. The list of names the lawyers compiled, they argue, will bolster Mr. Broidy’s case that the rulers of Qatar — the tiny Persian Gulf emirate that is a nemesis of the U.A.E.— had targeted him for his advocacy against them. Many of the other targets are well-known enemies of Qatar: senior officials of the U.A.E. and also of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Syria; American, British and Dutch commentators known for their criticism of Qatar; and two former employees of a Washington public affairs firm with U.A.E. ties. Others on the list, though, have no obvious appeal as targets for Qatar, including several Syrian Americans, activists on multiple sides of the Syrian conflict, a former official of the Central Intelligence Agency and, incongruously, a handful of Bollywood actresses. "
1784,"Now that the midterm elections have ended, this newsletter has been discontinued. Thank you for your interest. It’s hard to believe that two years have passed since the 2016 election, when America got its first reality-TV president, the Republican Party took control of both houses of Congress and a noxious cloud of discord and ill temper settled over the country. But the midterms are fast approaching, on Nov. 6, and we need to be prepared. To help international readers (and anyone else who’s interested) make sense of it all, I’m going to spend the five weeks in the run-up to the election writing a twice-weekly  newsletter aimed at exploring some of the most important races and pressing issues in the campaign. We’re calling it “Abroad in America.” The stakes are high. About 60 of the 435 House races are shaping up to be close battles that could tip the balance of power there. At the same time, 35 seats are in contention in the Senate, where the Republicans currently enjoy a majority of exactly two. In 36 states, voters are electing governors. All this adds up to something of a litmus test for President Trump and his unconventional approach. The results could decide his fate both immediately — it’s up to Congress to decide whether to advance or impede his agenda, for instance, not to mention whether to impeach him — and in the long term, as we look ahead, however wearily, to the next presidential election. Politics is not my usual beat, but I’ve written my share of political stories, both as a reporter in New York in the early 1990s and through many years, and several prime ministers, in London. Among the questions on my mind as I try to sort through the candidates (and the noise) in the midterms: How important are issues like immigration, gun control, tariffs and climate change? Is Russia controlling this election, too? If a state votes to legalize marijuana, is it O.K. to vote while high? And: Why does the president keep bringing up Hillary Clinton’s emails two years after she lost the last election? Will the Democrats continue to tack left at the risk of alienating moderate voters. (Are there any moderate voters left?) I’d love to hear what you’re interested in/confused about/nauseated by. Please send your questions to dearsarah@nytimes.com, and I’ll try to answer as many as I can in the newsletter, which will begin in October and end after the election. "
1785,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Russia’s plot to subvert an election, India’s new protections for Muslim women, a panda’s mating call. Here’s what you need to know: • The Russian plot. Over the past two years, the world has tried to absorb the details of Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. But the narrative is a confusing tangle of unfamiliar names and cyberjargon, further obscured by the shout-fest of partisan politics. So our reporters have unraveled the story so far in a special report, from the hacked emails and possible espionage to President Trump’s claims that it’s all a hoax. _____ • Mountaintop diplomacy in the Koreas. President Moon Jae-in of South Korea urged the U.S. to declare an official end to the Korean War, to provide incentives for North Korea’s denuclearization efforts. "
1786,"WASHINGTON — Taking a page from Vietnam War propaganda, the American military in Afghanistan has been widely publicizing body counts of Taliban and Islamic State fighters killed in battle. Officials described the practice, which began in January, as part of an apparent strategy to rally White House support for remaining in the conflict. In roughly three dozen statements, the military announced the deaths or wounding of more than 2,500 enemy fighters. The media releases were posted online, where they could have been seen by at least hundreds of thousands of internet followers, including on Facebook and Twitter. On Thursday morning, in response to questions from The New York Times, the practice abruptly stopped. The body counts served as a grisly contrast to other metrics that paint a grimmer reality of the war effort — including high attrition rates in the Afghan military and the loss of territory to Taliban militants. In one example, the military headquarters in Kabul announced that at least 1,700 enemy fighters had been killed or hurt in 90 operations over a three-week period in late June and early July. “The results seen on the battlefield are obvious,” Maj. Gen. Andrew Poppas, the chief of operations for the American-led campaign in Afghanistan, said in the July 21 news release. "
1787,"The number of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people nominated to run for Congress is four times higher than it was in 2010, a leading advocacy group said, spurred by greater social acceptance of sexual and gender minorities and a surge of liberal energy powered by opposition to the Trump administration. This year, there are 21 openly L.G.B.T. people nominated for Congress and four for governor, all Democrats, according to the L.G.B.T.Q. Victory Fund, a nonpartisan group that supports and tracks gay and transgender political candidates. Eight years ago, the first year the group started tracking candidates, there were only five openly L.G.B.T. people nominated for the U.S. House or Senate — again, all Democrats — and none for governor. Annise Parker, the group’s president and a former mayor of Houston, said the numbers represented a potential “rainbow wave” that she hoped could “transform the U.S. Congress and our governors’ mansions come November.” “It represents an evolution in American politics,” Ms. Parker said, “with voters choosing out L.G.B.T.Q. candidates as the solution to the divisiveness and dysfunction we see in Washington and in many of our state capitals.” Overall, there were more than 430 openly L.G.B.T. people running for office at all levels of government at the start of this year’s primary season. Now that the primaries are over, at least 244 of them have advanced to a ballot in November, including some independents and candidates for nonpartisan positions, the Victory Fund said. "
1788,"WASHINGTON — The woman who has accused Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh of sexual assault is prepared to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week, so long as senators offer “terms that are fair and which ensure her safety,” her lawyer told the committee on Thursday. The accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, ruled out Monday as a possibility, but also appeared to leave the door open to testifying even if the F.B.I. does not investigate her accusations, as she had previously requested. Her terms for testifying include that the senators must ask the questions — not an outside counsel — and that Judge Kavanaugh not be present in the hearing room while she speaks. The surprise offer was the latest twist in an on-again, off-again negotiation between Dr. Blasey and Senate Republicans, who have scheduled a hearing for Monday and set Friday as a deadline for Dr. Blasey to tell them whether she would attend. “She wishes to testify, provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety. A hearing on Monday is not possible, and the committee’s insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event,” wrote the lawyer, Debra S. Katz, adding, “Her strong preference continues to be for the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow for a full investigation prior to her testimony.” Dr. Blasey’s accusations have rocked Washington, upending the confirmation proceeding for Judge Kavanaugh, President Trump’s second nominee to the Supreme Court, only days before he was to receive a vote in the committee. A research psychologist in Northern California, Dr. Blasey — who is sometimes called by her married name, Ford — has accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when the two were in high school in the early 1980s — an allegation he has vigorously denied. [Read how Dr. Blasey went from the anonymity of academia to the center of a Supreme Court confirmation.] Thursday’s email jump-started talks between Dr. Blasey’s lawyers and Democratic and Republican committee aides that continued into the evening. They centered mostly on logistical issues, such as timing and security for Dr. Blasey, and whether there might be additional witnesses; the discussions were cordial, according to several people familiar with them.

1790,"On an October afternoon before the 2016 election, a huge banner was unfurled from the Manhattan Bridge in New York City: Vladimir V. Putin against a Russian-flag background, and the unlikely word “Peacemaker” below. It was a daredevil happy birthday to the Russian president, who was turning 64. In November, shortly after Donald J. Trump eked out a victory that Moscow had worked to assist, an even bigger banner appeared, this time on the Arlington Memorial Bridge in Washington: the face of President Barack Obama and “Goodbye Murderer” in big red letters. Police never identified who had hung the banners, but there were clues. The earliest promoters of the images on Twitter were American-sounding accounts, including @LeroyLovesUSA, later exposed as Russian fakes operated from St. Petersburg to influence American voters. The Kremlin, it appeared, had reached onto United States soil in New York and Washington. The banners may well have been intended as visual victory laps for the most effective foreign interference in an American election in history. For many Americans, the Trump-Russia story as it has been voluminously reported over the past two years is a confusing tangle of unfamiliar names and cyberjargon, further obscured by the shout-fest of partisan politics. What Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in charge of the investigation, may know or may yet discover is still uncertain. President Trump’s Twitter outbursts that it is all a “hoax” and a “witch hunt,” in the face of a mountain of evidence to the contrary, have taken a toll on public comprehension. But to travel back to 2016 and trace the major plotlines of the Russian attack is to underscore what we now know with certainty: The Russians carried out a landmark intervention that will be examined for decades to come. Acting on the personal animus of Mr. Putin, public and private instruments of Russian power moved with daring and skill to harness the currents of American politics. Well-connected Russians worked aggressively to recruit or influence people inside the Trump campaign. "

Did none of those who support this proposal have an important grandparent growing up? Do they not see the hypocrisy of denying others what was vital to them? Ilya Shlyakhter

1792,"Seeking to restore the trust of New York Catholics shaken by recent revelations of abuse, Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan announced on Thursday that he had appointed a former federal judge to review how the Archdiocese of New York handles cases of sexual abuse of minors and sexual harassment of adults. The review, led by Barbara S. Jones, a former judge in Federal District Court in Manhattan, will primarily focus on whether the archdiocese is following the protocols to protect minors from abuse that were approved by the nation’s bishops in 2002. Tackling a type of misconduct that was not addressed by the 2002 reforms, she will also examine whether current workplace policies are sufficient to prevent the sexual harassment of adults and other abuses of power in churches and seminaries. Cardinal Dolan said in a Thursday news conference that Catholics in the archdiocese had come to him repeatedly over the summer distraught over the litany of sex abuse revelations that seem to make daily headlines, including the lurid accusations against Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick, who was removed from ministry in June following a substantiated allegation of sex abuse of a minor in New York, and the explosive grand jury report into clergy sex abuse in Pennsylvania released in August. “I need your help if I am going to respond to my people’s plea for accountability, transparency and action,” Cardinal Dolan told Ms. Jones at the news conference. “I look forward to receiving your recommendations and your insights and I pledge that I will take them all with utmost seriousness.” Ms. Jones, 71, who will hold the title of special counsel and independent reviewer at the archdiocese, said she had been promised full access to personnel and other case files and will report directly to Cardinal Dolan. While producing a report for the public is not part of her initial mandate, Cardinal Dolan said that if he does not follow her recommendations, she should “hold my feet to the fire” and “report back to my people.” Two weeks ago, the attorney general of New York State announced a civil investigation into how all the Catholic dioceses in the state have handled sex abuse allegations over decades. Several states have opened similar probes following the revelations of sex abuse and cover-up in the Pennsylvania grand jury report. "

__________ Jack Ma’s American dream has woken up to a bitter reality. Alibaba’s retiring founder rescinded a promise to create 1 million jobs in the United States. He blamed tariff tensions between the United States and China, but his $420 billion company has not given foreigners a level playing field on his international e-commerce site. Like any exporter, Mr. Ma’s public championing of free trade blends enlightenment with self-interest. Alibaba.com was originally built to connect small Chinese wholesale manufacturers to overseas buyers. As domestic consumption boomed, however, the export operation was eclipsed by Taobao, Alibaba’s eBay-like marketplace, and the complementary Tmall, which hosts stores for bigger retailers. When Mr. Ma met Donald Trump in January 2017 before his inauguration, the Alibaba chairman vowed that 1 million small American businesses would gain access over five years and lead to a similar number of jobs, helping rebalance trade in the process. Most of those smaller merchants would have set up shop on Tmall Global. Theoretically, this subsite provides an easier channel to sell directly to Chinese customers, without the hassle and expense of creating an onshore entity, as required by Tmall. It attracted Costco, Gerber and most recently U.S. grocery chain Kroger, which began peddling a modest line of vitamins and nuts in August. The portal hosts around 18,000 vendors, so 1 million more would have been impressive. Since shopkeepers pay for the privilege of a storefront, Alibaba’s fees were more likely to rise than sales or jobs. The company does not break out specific sales figures for Tmall Global, describing it as a “testing ground.” While Tmall.com is the fourth most-visited website in China, Tmall.hk, the domain for Tmall Global, ranks 357th, according to Alexa data. In essence, it’s a smaller shopping center located far from where the Chinese action is. Why isn’t exactly clear, but domestic vendors on Taobao might not be so receptive to foreign competition. Even the mainstream Tmall has lost some foreign interest of late. Some Western companies have complained about the cost, others of the grey marketeers reselling their brands — or counterfeits — next door at Taobao. Alibaba has gotten better at helping Chinese merchants sell overseas. There’s nothing wrong with that per se, but it’s hardly a solution to imbalanced trade. "
1794,"NEAR MISCHIEF REEF, South China Sea — As the United States Navy reconnaissance plane banked low near Mischief Reef in the South China Sea early this month, a Chinese warning crackled on the radio. “U.S. military aircraft,” came the challenge, delivered in English in a harsh staccato. “You have violated our China sovereignty and infringed on our security and our rights. You need to leave immediately and keep far out.” Aboard the P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, flying in what is widely considered to be international airspace, Lt. Dyanna Coughlin scanned a live camera feed showing the dramatic evolution of Mischief Reef. Five years ago, this was mostly an arc of underwater atoll populated by tropical fish and turtles. Now Mischief Reef, which is off the Philippine coast but controlled by China, has been filled out and turned into a Chinese military base, complete with radar domes, shelters for surface-to-air missiles and a runway long enough for fighter jets. Six other nearby shoals have been similarly transformed by Chinese dredging. “I mean, this is insane,” Lieutenant Coughlin said. “Look at all that crazy construction.” A rare visit on board a United States Navy surveillance flight over the South China Sea pointed out how profoundly China has reshaped the security landscape across the region.

1795,"HOCKENHEIM, Germany — Twenty-four hulking, polychromatic stock cars rumbled into a tight configuration last Sunday on the starting grid of the Hockenheimring, an 86-year-old racing circuit in the Rhine Valley, before the final race on the penultimate weekend of Nascar’s Euro Series. Then the track really began to get crowded. First, a double-file procession of “Star Wars” cosplayers, 130 in all, shuffled silently across the asphalt. Close behind were three Germans dressed as 19th-century Old West frontiersmen and three more in Marvel superhero costumes. Nearby, two dozen teenage cheerleaders with crisp blue uniforms and swishy ponytails counted out routines in English, as if they had been flown in from an American high school pep rally. When they were in position, the costumed marchers and the perky cheerleaders all standing solemnly at attention, the American and German national anthems were played over the loudspeakers. It was only after that, after the crowd of characters had cleared the track and the competitors had buckled themselves into their cars, that the track announcer finally gave the familiar refrain: “Drivers, start your engines.” This loopy cross-cultural potpourri was a small taste of how Nascar — that oh-so-American of pastimes — is translated in Europe, where the organization has been having races since 2012. Each of the six race weekends on the calendar has an American theme, but even the organizers acknowledge it represents a version of America with exaggerated air quotes around it. “We work a lot with clichés,” said Jérôme Galpin, the 42-year-old founder and president of Euro Nascar. So there were fast cars and patient mechanics, but also cheerleaders and country music and something approximating barbecue. “It has to be fun,” Galpin said. “And it has to be American.” Or as his wife, Anne, the vice president of the series, described it: “Everything a European thinks is American.” "
1796,"To many artists, the Park Avenue Armory is a playground, a warren of idiosyncratic spaces overseen by adventurous souls since its conversion into a performing arts center in 2007. To some, it’s also a provocation. As the former home of the Seventh Regiment of the National Guard, this crenelated fortress can be seen as the expression in brick and granite of an intersection of money and weapons. And the meticulous restoration of some of the paneled reception rooms, with their Gilded Age décor and oil portraits of bearded officers, only reinforces the lingering feeling of an old boys’ club. On Wednesday there, the chamber choir the Crossing presented a site-specific program, “Of Arms and the Man,” made up of works by 10 composers that touched on themes including patriotism and war, environmental depredation and President Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. In written notes, the group’s director, Donald Nally, said he had been inspired by the contrast between the Armory’s elegant rooms and their past function to “train people to kill other people.” The program emphasized the Crossing’s gift for lending social activism poetic form, as well as its uncanny array of sounds, from mere fumes to piercing, feral cries. The evening was divided into two acts and two rooms on the Armory’s ground floor. Instrumental interludes performed by three cellists (Alexander Hersh, Arlen Hlusko and Thomas Mesa) linked the choral numbers, creating a mood that flowed from barely verbalized anxieties to sharply articulated political pieces. Things ended gently, with David Lang’s poignant “last spring,” about the transience of man’s life. A heavy-hearted prelude for cellos, Mr. Lang’s “depart,” welcomed audience members as they filed into the Board of Officers Room. (The second act was performed in the Veterans Room.) Members of the choir joined in wordlessly, and transitioned without pause into Gabriel Jackson’s “Our flags are wafting in hope and grief,” a beautiful setting of text by the Estonian poet Doris Kareva, with some voices generating syncopated rhythms under broad, swooping lines, and occasional ornamental shudders evoking the fluttering flags. "
1797,"If representative democracy requires informed citizens, a crop of new books is here to help with the informing. This week’s recommended titles include Jill Lepore’s expansive new history of the United States, Doris Kearns Goodwin’s consideration of four presidents who weathered national crises, a memoir about growing up in a Kansas farming family and a treatise about the importance of public spaces like libraries or parks. There’s also a look at the nature of authoritarian leaders, a reappraisal of Wendell Willkie’s 1940 run for president, and Adrienne Rich’s “Essential Essays” — a posthumous collection from a towering poet whose nonfiction drew in equal measure on her capacious heart and mind to engage with art, culture and politics. Let’s give her the last word, from an essay she wrote after refusing the National Medal for the Arts in 1997: “In the long run art needs to grow organically out of a social compost nourishing to everyone, a literate citizenry, a free, universal, public education complex with art as an integral element, a society honoring both human individuality and the search for a decent, sustainable common life. In such conditions, art would still be a voice of hunger, desire, discontent, passion, reminding us that the democratic project is never-ending. For that to happen, what else would have to change?” Gregory Cowles
Senior Editor, Books ESSENTIAL ESSAYS: Culture, Politics, and the Art of Poetry, by Adrienne Rich. (Norton, $27.95.) “Essential Essays” brings together a sampling of the poet Adrienne Rich’s influential criticism, personal accounts and public statements. Rich was sometimes charged with being more polemicist than poet, but “these essays tell a different story,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. “We see how frequently, and powerfully, she wrote from her divisions, the areas of her life where she felt vulnerable, conflicted and ashamed.” THESE TRUTHS: A History of the United States, by Jill Lepore. (Norton, $39.95.) This one-volume history of the United States is the latest from the prolific Lepore, a professor at Harvard and staff writer at The New Yorker. It begins in 1492, with Columbus’s arrival, and wends its way through the next five centuries, leavening some of the essential textbook material with stories that are lesser known. The book is “elegant, readable, sobering,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. “It extends a steadying hand when a breakneck news cycle lurches from one event to another, confounding minds and churning stomachs.” HOW FASCISM WORKS: The Politics of Us and Them, by Jason Stanley. (Random House, $26.) Looking across decades, Stanley argues that Donald Trump resembles other authoritarian nationalists, and places him in global and historical perspective to show patterns that others have missed. “Stanley is trying to spark public alarm,” Peter Beinart writes in his review. “He doesn’t want Americans to respond to Trump’s racist, authoritarian offensives by moving their moral goal posts. The greater danger, he suggests, isn’t hyperbole, it’s normalization.” "
1798,"Three women have publicly accused Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, of sexual assault or misconduct, with the latest allegation emerging on Wednesday. The accusations against Judge Kavanaugh started to surface this month as he faced confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The judge has denied the claims. On Thursday, as he testified before the committee about Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations, he said forcefully, “I am innocent.” [Here’s a guide to The New York Times’s coverage of the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh] What she said Dr. Blasey came forward in an interview published by The Washington Post on Sept. 16, saying that Judge Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when she was about 15 at a party in suburban Maryland in the early 1980s. She described a drunken Judge Kavanaugh pinning her on a bed, trying to take her clothing off and covering her mouth to keep her from screaming. “I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” the newspaper quoted her as saying. “He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.” "
1799,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has some advice for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh as he prepares for Thursday’s climactic Senate hearing to confront sexual misconduct allegations: Be more aggressive, show more outrage, push back more. In other words, be more like Mr. Trump. But what works for Mr. Trump might not work for Judge Kavanaugh. His challenge is not to look like he is attacking his accusers. Anger could touch off a backlash, advisers said, though at the same time he needs to show more indignation than he did during a Fox News interview on Monday when he stuck closely to talking points and looked rehearsed. For Christine Blasey Ford, the California university professor who will testify about the night she said a drunken Mr. Kavanaugh held her down on a bed and tried to remove her clothes, the challenge is different. An unknown figure, she will be introducing herself to the senators and the nation for the first time, explaining who she is, what happened 36 years ago and why her account is more credible than his denial. She faces a veteran sex crimes prosecutor who will question her for Republicans, a scenario that could rattle even a more seasoned witness. In her case, according to political veterans, details will matter. She has not been able to determine the date or location of the incident, so the more she can recall about the event, the more specific her account is, the stronger her case will be. She is no veteran of the klieg-light culture of Washington. Any way it proceeds, the hearing scheduled to open at 10 a.m. on Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee will be unlike any Washington has seen since the Clarence Thomas confirmation in 1991. At stake is the swing seat on a Supreme Court divided ideologically between four conservatives and four liberals. And if that were not consequential enough, the debate is taking place in the thick of a midterm election campaign that will determine who controls Congress for the final two years of Mr. Trump’s term. Just as the two main protagonists will be tested, so will the 21 senators on the Judiciary Committee. Judge Kavanaugh’s future may hinge on a question that Republicans and Democrats approach very differently: What should be the standard of proof for Dr. Blasey’s allegations? "
1800,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Takes Aim at New Accuser: She ‘Has Nothing’” (front page, Sept. 26): We may never know what happened between Brett Kavanaugh and his accusers, but we do know who Judge Kavanaugh is. I am the mother of three daughters, now in their late 20s, who attended Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Md., which Christine Blasey Ford attended. My daughters had many friends who attended the elite all-boys private schools in the Washington area, including Georgetown Prep, which Judge Kavanaugh attended. I can tell you unequivocally that the culture of committing, encouraging and boasting about sexual violence against girls was still prevalent at these schools in the 2000s. I knew many boys at these schools, however, and most of them did not conduct themselves in the manner of Judge Kavanaugh’s group of friends. And most young men do not join college fraternities that debase women. It was Judge Kavanaugh’s choice to join the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity at Yale, finally exposed in 2011 for its pledge chant, “No means yes, yes means anal.” It was Judge Kavanaugh’s choice to join the all-male Yale secret society Truth and Courage, also referred to as “Tit and Clit.” The appalling fact that victims of sexual violence are still being discredited and shamed by our society’s power structure shows that little has changed over the last three decades. Most men in our society, however, have never committed, or tolerated, debasing acts toward women. Judge Kavanaugh is just not one of these men. Cherie Mohr

To the Editor: Re “Outsider Faced Culture of Privilege and Alcohol” (front page, Sept. 26): Those of us who were financial aid students at Yale in the 1980s can testify that the university’s attempts at increased diversity and coeducation during this period often led to incidents like the one experienced by Deborah Ramirez. During freshman year students of extremely different socioeconomic backgrounds and levels of privilege are given the illusion of equality when all housed together on Old Campus; this illusion can be shattered easily, however, when excessive drinking happens and all become disinhibited.

1801,"BERLIN — A year ago, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey told Germans of Turkish origin not to vote for Chancellor Angela Merkel, branding her governing coalition “enemies of Turkey.” On Thursday, Mr. Erdogan arrived in Berlin for a three-day state visit, complete with military honors, a state banquet and a lunch with Ms. Merkel. The rapprochement is striking and no coincidence: With Turkey suffering the aftershocks of its worst economic crisis in 15 years, Mr. Erdogan has radically changed tune and toned down his anti-Western rhetoric. “We want to completely leave behind all the problems and to create a warm environment between Turkey and Germany just like it used to be,” he said earlier this week. For Germany, the aim of this week’s state visit in Berlin, officials say, is to normalize prickly relations with an important NATO partner on Europe’s southeastern flank. For Turkey, indirectly, one goal is to repair relations with the United States, which imposed sanctions this summer over the continued detention of an American pastor. But the visit has also underscored that, like him or not, Europe has to deal with Mr. Erdogan and the reality of a budding dictator on its border. Turkey’s stability — both economic and geopolitical — remains a strategic priority for Germany and Europe. "
1802,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that the accusations against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court nominee, “are all false,” but also said that he “can always be convinced” after watching the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused the judge of attempted rape. In a rambling and combative news conference during which he lashed out against Democratic senators, Mr. Trump said that his own opinion about Judge Kavanaugh’s case is affected by the many allegations of sexual misconduct that have been leveled against him by women in the past. “It does impact my opinion. You know why? Because I’ve had a lot of false charges made against me,” Mr. Trump said. “People want fame, they want money, they want whatever. So when I see it, I view it differently than someone sitting at home watching television.” Speaking in New York, where he was attending the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Trump repeatedly refused to give a direct answer to whether he thought the three women who have accused Judge Kavanaugh of misconduct are liars. He initially said that “these are all false — to me — false accusations, in certain cases.” But pressed a few minutes later, he said that “I’m going to see what happens tomorrow.” “I’m going to be watching, you know, believe it or not,” he said. “It’s possible they will be convincing.” “They are going to have a big shot at speaking or making their case, and you know what, I could be persuaded,” the president said. At the same time, he added that Democrats had orchestrated “a big fat con job” by engineering the accusations against Judge Kavanaugh, and Mr. Trump predicted that when Democratic senators are behind closed doors, “I guarantee you, they laugh like hell.” "
1803,"The role of evangelical Christianity in American politics today has been a hotly discussed topic since President Trump’s election, both politically and spiritually. Many evangelical leaders have publicly supported Mr. Trump’s policies, and others have pushed back. I’m a national correspondent for The Times, covering religion and politics. I’ve written dozens of stories about evangelicals over the past few years. I’ve been traveling the country ahead of the midterms, and I’m interested in hearing more from young evangelicals — the future of the evangelical movement. If you are an evangelical born after 1980, I’d love to hear about the relationship between your faith and politics today. And if you grew up evangelical and your views are shifting, feel free to share that, too. We may publish a selection of the responses. "
1804,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. On the eve of hearings at which one of the Supreme Court nominee’s accusers will testify, a theme has emerged as friends and acquaintances recall him as a youth: heavy drinking. Extreme inebriation is also central in the account of a third accuser. Represented by Michael Avenatti, the lawyer who represented Stormy Daniels, she offered an account — but no witnesses — of alcohol-soaked parties when they were teenagers at which women were verbally abused, inappropriately touched and “gang raped.” She said she saw him line up outside a bedroom where “numerous boys” were “waiting for their ‘turn’ with a girl inside the room.” Judge Kavanaugh denied the claims, which set off another round of uncertainty about his chances of confirmation. _____ "
1805,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] President Trump is back to his standard playbook for sexual assault allegations: Deny, dismiss and blame the accuser. The tactic was on full display at a news conference in New York City this evening, in one of those vintage stream-of-consciousness appearances that the president rode into the White House. He rejected all three allegations of sexual assault against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh as false. Democrats, he said, were “dishonest people” running a “con job” on the American public. And, perhaps most strikingly, the president said his personal experience with accusations of sexual assault “absolutely” influence his thinking about the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump was accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women. Mr. Trump saved his empathy not for the women, but for the man facing the claims. Even by Mr. Trump’s standards, the news conference was rambling and at times almost jaw-dropping. He veered from talking about North Korea to the employment state of Rod Rosenstein. He made misleading claims, including that he won a majority of women’s votes in 2016. He said Chinese leaders respect his “very large brain.” And he wondered aloud whether George Washington had a “bad past.” At one point, a CNN reporter suggested the president could call on women reporters. “What does he mean by that,” Mr. Trump bristled. “What does he mean by that?” But, after that, Mr. Trump called on a series of female journalists. ____________________ A quick rundown of the latest developments in the Kavanaugh story: • There were new allegations of drugging and gang rape, from a woman who said she had attended parties with Judge Kavanaugh in high school. (She was represented by Michael Avenatti, the lawyer-turned-liberal-firebrand whose clients include Stormy Daniels.) "
1806,"Enough. With a third woman stepping forward with accusations that the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh committed sexual assault as a young man, this destructive stampede of a confirmation, driven so far by partisan calculation, needs to yield at last to common sense: Let qualified investigators — the F.B.I. — do their job. Let them interview the many witnesses whose names are already in the public record, among them Judge Kavanaugh’s close high-school friend Mark Judge, then weigh the credibility of the various claims and write a report for the White House and the Senate Judiciary Committee. To jam Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation through now, without seeking to dispel the darkening cloud over his head, would be to leave the public in doubt about his honesty and character — and to set an even lower standard for taking claims of sexual abuse seriously than the Senate did 27 years ago in considering the accusations against Clarence Thomas by Anita Hill. Yes, partisan games have no doubt been played on both sides. But the only reason for so much urgency about this confirmation is politics; the same cannot be said about calls for holding a fair and thorough investigation. To recap: On Wednesday morning, the bomb-throwing lawyer Michael Avenatti made public an affidavit from Julie Swetnick, a woman who grew up in the Washington suburbs and claims to have traveled the same 1980s social circuit as Judge Kavanaugh. Ms. Swetnick says that he drank excessively at many parties she attended; that he was verbally abusive and physically aggressive toward young women, fondling and grabbing them; and that he was part of a group of young men who would spike the punch at parties with alcohol or illicit drugs with an eye toward incapacitating the female attendees, including Ms. Swetnick herself, and then abusing them. These are grotesque charges — and, like the previous ones, they leave oceans of room for speculation and doubt. This is precisely why the Senate needs to stop trying to ram through this nomination by some arbitrary deadline and arrange for a thorough and nonpartisan inquiry. "
1807,"Nearly a month after Colin Kaepernick was revealed as the face of Nike’s groundbreaking new advertising campaign, the unveiling video has garnered more than 80 million views on Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. The ads have sent Kaepernick into a new realm of celebrity, quickly becoming among the most talked-about and successful campaigns in recent years. And they have allowed Nike, which has a history of provocative marketing campaigns, to capitalize on the so-called Resistance movement in a way it only recently realized it could. They are also yet another vehicle for Kaepernick to raise his own profile as a sort of civil rights entrepreneur unlike anyone before has, certainly in sports. He has signed deals to write a book — which is set to be published next year and will be accompanied by a speaking tour — and to develop a comedy series. But it almost didn’t happen. In the summer of 2017, a debate raged in Nike’s headquarters in Beaverton, Ore., over whether to cut loose the controversial, unemployed quarterback — and the company very nearly did, according to two individuals with knowledge of the discussions who requested anonymity because of nondisclosure agreements each has with Nike. When the company did decide to embrace the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, it risked angering the National Football League, a Nike partner since 2012, but the company ultimately decided it was a risk worth taking, given the credibility the company would gain with the young, urban market it has long targeted. Kaepernick ignited a national discourse in 2016 when he began kneeling during the playing of the national anthem before games to protest racism, social inequality and police brutality. He left the 49ers after the 2016 season and became a free agent, but executives throughout the N.F.L. considered him radioactive because of his on-field protests, which drew vocal criticism from President Trump, and no team signed him. "
1808,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that he wants to keep in place the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, amid speculation about Mr. Rosenstein’s future, which was thrust into doubt by revelations that he had discussed secretly taping the president and removing him from office. The two were scheduled to meet on Thursday to discuss Mr. Rosenstein’s comments, which were revealed in a New York Times article last week, prompting Mr. Rosenstein to tell senior White House aides over the weekend that he was considering resigning. [Read: Rod Rosenstein Suggested Secretly Recording Trump and Discussed 25th Amendment] Asked during a news conference at the United Nations whether he planned to fire Mr. Rosenstein, Mr. Trump said, “I would certainly prefer not doing that.” Mr. Trump added: “We’ve had a good talk. He said he never said it, he said he doesn’t believe it. He said he has a lot of respect for me, and he was very nice, and we’ll see.” Mr. Trump also said he was considering delaying their meeting because he wanted to focus on Thursday’s high-stakes hearing for his Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, and one of the women who have accused him of sexual assault, Christine Blasey Ford. White House officials declined to say whether the meeting between Mr. Rosenstein and Mr. Trump had ever been planned for or put on the president’s calendar. Over the weekend, Mr. Rosenstein told senior White House advisers that he was willing to resign. On Monday morning, as Mr. Rosenstein planned to head to the White House, news reports emerged that he was quitting, sending the situation into further chaos. Mr. Rosenstein headed to the White House expecting to be fired after the reports. Once there, he asked to meet with Mr. Trump before any decisions were made about his future, according to people briefed on the discussions. He also said that he wanted to leave on amicable terms and did not want to trigger the president’s ire. But some White House officials believed that only Mr. Trump could legally accept Mr. Rosenstein’s resignation, and the president was in New York for the United Nations General Assembly. Mr. Rosenstein left the White House hours later, job intact. That afternoon, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement that the men would meet when Mr. Trump returned. "
1809,"Five Latin American countries and Canada on Wednesday urged the International Criminal Court to consider prosecuting senior officials in Venezuela for extensive human rights abuses, the first time that member nations have referred another member to the tribunal. In a region where leaders tend to avoid criticizing one another publicly, the step by Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Peru represented an extraordinary rebuke of President Nicolás Maduro. Governments in the region have become increasingly alarmed about the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. Acute shortages of food and medicine have prompted millions to migrate, largely to neighboring countries. The referral gives The Hague-based tribunal a renewed sense of urgency to investigate abuses in Venezuela. “The leaders of these six countries have taken a historic step today, unprecedented in the history of the Americas, creating a crucial milestone in the interests of justice, accountability, non-repetition and reparation to the victims of the Venezuelan dictatorship,” said Luis Almagro, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, in a statement. Here are some facts about the referral to the international court and what it could mean for Venezuela: "
1810,"The fight over control of the House of Representatives runs through suburban battlegrounds, where Democrats and Republicans both believe they need to win the votes of college-educated white women, particularly independents who voted for President Trump in 2016. Those women are more inclined than most voters to say that Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh should not be confirmed for a seat on the United States Supreme Court following decades-old allegations of sexual assault against him. Republican women running in those districts have had to calibrate their response to those allegations; to avoid alienating female voters, while not straying from the party’s support of Judge Kavanaugh, they have argued that his accusers must be heard. And in an indication of how fraught the situation is, many Democratic women running for those seats have so far largely held back from deploying the allegations as a weapon against their opponents. Some Democrats have issued statements supporting Christine Blasey Ford, who has said Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a drunken party when they were teenagers, and have urged the F.B.I. to investigate her allegations. Many have also supported another woman who says Judge Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drinking game when they were students at Yale. Several candidates, including those running in swing districts in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, stood on stage at an event Monday for Emily’s List, the Democratic fund-raising group, wearing black in solidarity with victims of sexual assault and holding signs saying “I Believe Christine Blasey Ford.” Others embraced the #BelieveWomen hashtag on Twitter. Still, most said they are waiting and watching to see how Dr. Blasey is treated when she appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, and whether it becomes a repeat of Anita Hill, who met skepticism and shame when she accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment as the Senate considered his Supreme Court nomination 27 years ago. “The country is watching as those in Washington react to sexual assault allegations,” Susan Wild, a Democrat who is running in a tossup district in Pennsylvania, said in a statement. She called Dr. Blasey “incredibly courageous to have come forward with her story in the midst of a heated and politicized Supreme Court nomination battle.” "

1812,"Updated Sept. 30 Struggling to catch up on the news with Brett Kavanaugh and the F.B.I. investigation? Here’s the latest guide to Times coverage. Uncertainty continues to hover over President Trump’s nomination of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court as the F.B.I. carries out a renewed background check into sexual assault allegations against the judge. Mr. Trump ordered that inquiry on Friday after demands from key Senate Republicans. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted to advance the nomination to the full Senate, but the F.B.I.’s background check will delay a confirmation vote by as much as one week. Questions emerged about the inquiry’s scope and who the F.B.I. will interview. A day earlier, the committee — and the nation — heard emotional and contradicting accounts from the judge and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who have accused him of sexually assaulting them decades ago. Judge Kavanaugh, who adamantly denied the claims, at times crafted responses that were misleading, disputed or off point, our fact-check found. Here’s a guide to the latest coverage from The Times. ____ Mr. Trump’s announcement came after Senator Jeff Flake, a crucial swing vote, said he would not support Judge Kavanaugh’s final confirmation until the F.B.I. investigated the accusations. "
1813,"WASHINGTON — The House and Senate have reached agreement on a big package of measures to address the opioid epidemic. The legislation, backed by leaders of both parties, is a rare bipartisan achievement that lawmakers are eager to have in hand when they go home to campaign for the midterm elections. The 653-page bill contains a mix of law enforcement and public health measures, including one that aims to block deadly fentanyl from being imported through the mail and one that will allow more nurses to prescribe medication for opioid addiction. Another provision could make it easier for Medicaid recipients to get inpatient care for substance abuse over the next five years. “While there is more work to be done, this bipartisan legislation takes an important step forward and will save lives,” a group of Republican and Democratic committee leaders said in a statement. But addiction experts say that while many of the measures will help incrementally, the investment remains meager and scattershot compared with what is needed, and with what the government spent to stem the tide of AIDS-related deaths in the 1990s. With 72,000 overdose deaths in 2017, including nearly 50,000 involving opioids, members of Congress are eager to wield the bill as a substantive policy achievement amid the drama surrounding the fates of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, and Rod Rosenstein, his deputy attorney general. Both chambers still need to vote on the compromise bill. The House could vote as soon as Wednesday night, before its members adjourn to hit the campaign trail, and the Senate could take it up next week. "
1814,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is investigating whether Yale University illegally discriminated against Asian-American applicants, according to a letter delivered on Wednesday, escalating its effort to challenge race-based admissions policies at elite universities. The Justice and Education Departments have begun a civil rights investigation into whether Yale discriminated against Asian-Americans “by treating applicants differently based on race during the admissions process,” according to a letter from the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights sent to the student who filed a complaint against Yale. The letter was obtained by The New York Times. The Justice Department is also investigating Harvard’s use of race in its admissions policies, and last month it publicly backed students who accused Harvard in a lawsuit of systematically discriminating against them by suppressing the number of Asian-Americans who attend the school to make room for less-qualified students of other races. The Harvard and Yale investigations and the lawsuit could have far-reaching consequences for college admissions policies and for affirmative action, a tool born in the civil-rights era to make American education and opportunity more equitable. Some conservative groups have long opposed affirmative action, and a handful of states have banned affirmative action policies at public universities. “This is a battle over the ability of individual institutions to define diversity in a manner that they see appropriate,” said Peter McDonough, general counsel at the American Council on Education. “Institutions have the right to determine what their student bodies will look like in terms of athletes, musicians, geographic diversity, and racial and ethnic diversity. There is a constituency that wants to eliminate those last two things.” If Yale is found to have treated the student differently during the admissions process based on race, that would violate the Civil Rights Act. The school’s president, Peter Salovey, denied the claims. "

__________ Nothing so far has succeeded in ending the bull run in stocks that began nearly a decade ago. The rally survived the sluggish economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the European debt crises, fiscal battles in Washington, the oil bust, concerns about China’s growth and, most recently, President Trump’s trade war. Now the stock market faces a more prosaic but nonetheless powerful threat: increasingly attractive returns on government bonds. For years, yields on Treasuries were so low that investors had an incentive to buy stocks in the hope of higher returns. Yields are still quite low by historical standards, but they have been rising in recent weeks, and they could go even higher if the Federal Reserve keeps raising its target interest rate. (An increase was announced on Wednesday.) The more yields go up, the more likely investors will choose the relative safety of Treasuries — and that could cause the stock rally to stall. Warren E. Buffett has often commented on the connection between government bond yields and stock market investments. In a 1999 article in Fortune, Mr. Buffett said, “The rates of return that investors need from any kind of investment are directly tied to the risk-free rate that they can earn from government securities.” The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has risen to 3.1 percent, from 2.4 percent at the end of last year, and analysts expect the yield to climb to 3.42 percent by the end of 2019, according to a Wall Street Journal survey. That yield is still far from beating the stock market’s recent annual performances. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 19 percent last year and is up 9 percent this year. But buying a 10-year Treasury today would provide its holders with 3 percent a year for a decade with virtually no risk of losing any money in the process. "
1816,"LIVERPOOL, England — Jeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain’s opposition Labour Party, doubled down Wednesday on his platform, promising to sweep away “greed is good” capitalism and expand the state’s role in the economy as he closed an annual conference dominated by divisions over European Union withdrawal. Outlining a “radical plan to rebuild and transform” Britain, Mr. Corbyn underscored his ambition to shift economic policy leftward — a position that he described as the “new common sense of our time” after a decade of stagnating wages and squeezed living standards. In a speech intended to present him as a prime minister in waiting, Mr. Corbyn said that it would be a “national disaster” if Britain quit the European Union without a deal. If Prime Minister Theresa May cannot negotiate a satisfactory withdrawal agreement, he said, she should “make way for a party that can and will.” Mr. Corbyn had harsh words for familiar adversaries in the British news media, which is mainly hostile to him and which, he said, enjoys the “freedom to spread lies and half-truths.” As for President Trump, Mr. Corbyn derided “America First posturing” and the decisions to pull out of the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal and to move the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. “He is turning his back on international cooperation and even international law,” Mr. Corbyn said. In the domestic sphere, Mr. Corbyn proposed to expand free child care and create 400,000 jobs in clean-energy technologies. "
1817,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister, shared the debut of a new assistance package for families from her couch in a Facebook Live video in which she could be seen cradling her 10-day-old daughter, Neve, in a bundle of blankets. Between parenting jokes and policy explanations, she called the $5 billion package of tax cuts and payments “the most significant change to the country’s welfare system in decades.” Of all her government’s efforts, “this is the thing I’m most proud of,” she said, telling the audience that if she looked tired it was only because she was not wearing makeup. The video from July was just one example of Ms. Ardern testing the reach of what she describes as politics “with a bit of heart.” In many ways — temperament, style and policy, among them — Ms. Ardern is the polar opposite of President Trump and other brash male leaders. She has become a subject of global fascination for her progressive values, her youth and charisma, and her status as a new mother who has garnered more attention than any previous leader of this small Pacific country. This week, with her partner and daughter, now 3 months old, she is taking her pitch to New York. She will deliver New Zealand’s national statement at the United Nations on Thursday. "
1818,"WASHINGTON — In a political climate that allows little tolerance for nuance, Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana has been trying to thread the needle. He is a Republican who says he rejects the binary “you’re with us or against us” construction that defines many debates in Washington. And in a dispute as bitter as the Supreme Court confirmation of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, his approach has differentiated him from other Republican members on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Many Republicans appear to have reached a boiling point with Democrats and Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were teenagers and is set to testify before the committee on Thursday. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina recently suggested she was “being used” and said he was unwilling to “ruin Judge Kavanaugh’s life over this.” Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, has all but dismissed Dr. Blasey’s claims as false and blamed Democrats for “a choreographed smear campaign.” Mr. Kennedy has maintained a cooler public face. A former Democrat who is in his first Senate term, Mr. Kennedy has a disarming, aw-shucks manner that masks tough-mindedness. His questioning last year of one of President Trump’s judicial nominees, Matthew Petersen, helped force Mr. Petersen to withdraw after he struggled to answer basic questions from Mr. Kennedy like how many depositions he had taken or how many motions he had argued in court. The New York Times caught up with Mr. Kennedy on Wednesday morning in between an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” and a Senate prayer breakfast. The following interview has been edited and condensed. It was conducted before a third woman, Julie Swetnick, came forward Wednesday with allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior during the 1980s against Judge Kavanaugh. Q: What will you be listening for, looking for, most closely Thursday when you hear Dr. Blasey speak? "
1819,"A racially tinged campaign attack ad released by Representative Chris Collins has drawn the opposite of its intended effect — causing a fellow House member to criticize him in unusually caustic terms. Representative Ted W. Lieu, a Democrat from California, called Mr. Collins, who was indicted last month on insider trading charges, “an embarrassment to the House of Representatives” on Tuesday, days after Mr. Collins released the television ad attacking his Democratic challenger, Nate McMurray. In a Twitter post, Mr. Lieu shared an article from The New York Times about Mr. Collins’s advertisement, which added misleading text to a video of Mr. McMurray speaking Korean. Mr. McMurray, whose wife is a naturalized citizen from South Korea, said the ad was “xenophobic.” Mr. Lieu used more direct language. “Take your racist ad and shove it,” he wrote on Twitter. Mr. Lieu said on Wednesday that he was personally offended by the advertisement. As an Asian-American who grew up speaking Mandarin Chinese with his family, Mr. Lieu said he felt the ad conveyed the idea that speaking another language was un-American. “This is an issue that has affected the Asian-American community, and for Chris Collins to do this is wholly unacceptable,” Mr. Lieu said in an interview. “He is playing to racial stereotypes that have been particularly hurtful to Americans who happen to be of Asian descent.” "
1820,"The extraordinary rise of Uber has transformed the ride-hail industry and in some cities, including New York, it has contributed to increased congestion. Now, Uber, in a move that was met with derision by critics, says it wants to help solve some of the problems it has helped cause. The company announced on Wednesday that it would spend $10 million to help cities develop more efficient transportation policies and reduce congestion and vehicle emissions. The money will be given out over the next three years as part of a campaign by Uber to support efforts around the world to get more people to leave their personal cars at home and take greener alternatives such as car pools, public transit and bikes. To that end, some of the money will be used to advocate for congestion pricing plans, which charge drivers for entering the busiest neighborhoods at peak traffic times. Uber, which has long guarded data collected by its vehicles, will also release data on the speeds traveled on individual streets to more cities to help them better assess traffic conditions and manage congestion. The campaign will give $250,000 to SharedStreets, a transportation data-sharing project, to develop ways to publicly share data from Uber and other private technology companies. Separately, Uber has also released some of its data on pickups and drop-offs as part of another effort to help cities reimagine the use of curb space that is usually reserved for parking. “As more people have come to rely on Uber, our technology has become an important part of the transportation fabric of cities,” Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive officer, wrote in a blog post announcing the campaign. “With that comes a responsibility: we recognize we need to step up and support cities that take bold steps to solve their transportation problems. We are in a unique position to have a meaningful and positive impact on the communities we serve across the globe — a responsibility we don’t take lightly.” But some critics, including taxi owners and drivers, pointed out that Uber was a major reason congestion has gotten worse in many cities. Last month, New York became the first American city to halt new vehicle licenses for ride-hailing services, whose vehicles often drive around empty in between passengers on the busiest streets. The number of for-hire vehicles in the city has surged past 100,000 from about 63,000 in 2015. "
1821,"The news about Brett Kavanaugh and Rod Rosenstein is addictive, but spare just a moment for crimes against humanity that the United States is supporting in far-off Yemen. President Trump didn’t mention it at the United Nations, but America is helping to kill, maim and starve Yemeni children. At least eight million Yemenis are at risk of starvation from an approaching famine caused not by crop failures but by our actions and those of our allies. The United Nations has called it the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, and we own it. An American bomb made by Lockheed Martin struck a Yemen school bus last month, killing 51 people. Earlier, American bombs killed 155 mourners at a funeral and 97 people at a market. Starving Yemeni children are reduced to eating a sour paste made of leaves. Even those who survive will often be stunted for the rest of their lives, physically and mentally. Many global security issues involve complex trade-offs, but this is different: Our behavior is just unconscionable. "
1822,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A bold accusation against China, more allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, an unusual political race in Japan. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump takes another swipe at China. In opening remarks to the U.N. Security Council, Mr. Trump accused China of meddling with U.S. midterm elections. He provided no evidence, but the president has previously criticized China’s retaliatory tariffs aimed at industries in politically crucial states. “They do not want me or us to win, because I am the first president to ever challenge China on trade,” Mr. Trump said. He also attacked Iran in his speech, calling it “the world’s leading sponsor of terror.” Cutting a very different figure is Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand, whose youth, progressive politics and 3-month-old baby have grabbed the world’s attention. She will be speaking at the U.N. today. PS: The 15-member Security Council is the U.N.’s most important arm, with the power to impose sanctions and authorize military interventions. Here’s more about what the U.N. actually does and how it works. _____ • Judge Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser testify. The Supreme Court nominee, above, is expected to tell a Senate committee today that he “was not perfect” in high school while denying the sexual assault allegations against him. "
1823,"Trailed by the Russia investigation, back-stabbing within his administration, looming midterm elections and Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s troubled nomination, President Trump arrived this week in New York distracted and under siege. At first blush, Mr. Trump’s second appearance at the United Nations General Assembly may have seemed like more self-congratulatory bluster, nationalist isolationism and rote genuflection to the altar of sovereignty — much like last year. But this time, Americans suffered the added humiliation of watching the world burst out laughing at their president, whose false bravado no longer induces shock but invites derision. Given this drama, it’s easy to mistake Mr. Trump’s visit for a mash-up of meetings and muddled messages. But careful observers should not be diverted from discerning the president’s real purpose at the United Nations, because it is ominous. On four critical policy fronts, President Trump foreshadowed his intention to ignore our greatest threats and to stoke fresh conflict where it is neither necessary nor wise. More telling than his rabidly ideological speech to the General Assembly was the president’s more substantive remarks before the Security Council on Wednesday. And by now we have ample reason to conclude that Mr. Trump generally means what he says and (eventually) does much of what he threatens. First, President Trump doubled down on his determination to exonerate Russia and minimize the serious threat that it poses to us and our allies. In a Security Council session devoted to the preventing the proliferation of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, Mr. Trump ignored Russia’s recent attack with a deadly nerve agent that severely sickened four people in Britain and may have killed one other. He neglected to name Russia as the principal violator of United Nations sanctions on North Korea. And he failed to condemn Russia’s repeated lies to cover for Syria’s use of chemical weapons. Not once in a visit whose central theme was American sovereignty did Mr. Trump mention Russia’s extraordinary and continuing interference in our democratic process. For reasons we can only hope will soon become clear, President Trump remains determined to coddle our most dangerous adversary, to the increasing detriment of our national security. Second, President Trump persisted in fueling the false impression that he has effectively addressed the grave threat from North Korea. Granted, the reduction in tensions between North and South Korea and Mr. Trump’s dialogue with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, are preferable to “fire and fury.” While the North’s moratorium on missile and nuclear tests is a necessary first step, we are no closer to the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea than this time last year. "
1824,"UNITED NATIONS — President Trump on Wednesday accused a foreign power of meddling in an American election: not Russia, but China. The Chinese, Mr. Trump claimed, are trying to damage his political standing before the midterm elections because of his imposition of tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese goods. Speaking at the United Nations Security Council, where China’s foreign minister was also present, he said, “They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president to ever challenge China on trade.” It was not the first time the president has accused the Chinese of meddling in the nation’s affairs: He has complained that in response to his tariffs, it had imposed retaliatory ones aimed at American farmers and other politically sensitive constituencies in states that support him. But he has never leveled the accusation so bluntly or in such a high-profile international setting. Mr. Trump did not suggest that China’s behavior was on the scale of Russia’s sophisticated campaign of manipulating social media and the release of hacked emails during the 2016 presidential election. And he did not even mention Russia’s interference, even though its foreign minister was also at the Council session, and it has been identified for its meddling by American intelligence agencies — a fact that Mr. Trump only halfheartedly acknowledges. “Well, I think it’s different,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference later in the day, when he was asked to compare the Chinese and Russian efforts. "
1825,"The daily bombardment of news about sexual violence is causing some women to relive their own trauma. Others are simply enraged. Carrying these emotions can be utterly exhausting. Just on Tuesday, there was a barrage of stories about the allegations of sexual misconduct against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court. If you flipped the channel, there was wall-to-wall coverage of Bill Cosby’s prison sentence for drugging and sexually assaulting a woman in his home. On Thursday, you would have had to unplug completely to avoid watching senators and a prosecutor question Judge Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, when they were teenagers. Dr. Blasey said she was “terrified” to be at the hearing, held by the Senate Judiciary Committee, but provided a detailed account of an assault that she said she was “100 percent” sure Judge Kavanaugh had committed. Judge Kavanaugh vehemently and emotionally denied the allegation. Victims of sexual violence, women and men included, are struggling to cope with the rapid pace of news that can provoke flashbacks to their own experiences, said Dr. Christine Nicholson, a clinical psychologist who works near Seattle. Dr. Nicholson, who treats survivors of assault, said several of her clients had brought up the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh in their sessions. Their emotional responses to events of the #MeToo era vacillate between extreme anger and helplessness, she said. “It’s a very difficult time,” she said. “I’m having people call me after hours where they’re just feeling meltdowns and a sense of hopelessness.” "
1826,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Chronic pain exacts a terrible toll on human well-being. More than 10 percent of Americans suffer from pain every day, according to the National Institutes of Health, and many more suffer from it sporadically. Academic research has found that pain is one of the biggest sources of unhappiness. Pain sufferers, as the economist Alan Krueger told me, “typically lead more isolated lives, work less, and have lower life satisfaction.” The high cost of chronic pain makes opioid use a much more complicated issue than the headlines often suggest. It’s certainly true that opioids have become a public-health crisis, playing a role in some 50,000 overdose deaths in the United States last year. But opioids also do a lot of good. For many pain sufferers, opioids are more effective at treating pain than any other treatment. So how can this country take aggressive action to reduce opioid deaths without also denying medication to people who benefit from it? German Lopez of Vox has written the best overview of the topic that I’ve yet read. The article is billed as a guide for “how to fix America’s painkiller problem — without leaving pain patients behind.” It inspired me to do some of my own reporting on the topic yesterday. My main takeaways: If you’re interested in the topic, I recommend reading Lopez’s full piece. I realize that opioids aren’t the biggest news story this week. But there aren’t many issues that have a bigger effect on Americans’ daily lives than the intersection of opioid overuse and chronic pain. [Laughter] President Trump is accustomed to telling blatant lies and having the people around him — many of whom work for him — pretend he’s speaking the truth. But when he went to the United Nations yesterday and told an obvious lie in front of the leaders of the world, they had a much more appropriate response than sycophancy. They laughed at him. "
1827,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) As the revolutions of 1848 spread across Europe, a young Prussian man named August Schuckman boarded a ship in Hamburg called the Perseverance. He landed in New York and made his way west, reaching Sacramento in 1852 and eventually settling at the Mountain House, as his Colusa County ranch came to be known. A century later, August Schuckman’s great-grandson Jerry Brown spent time visiting the Mountain House with his family — his three sisters, his mother and his father, Gov. Pat Brown. Now governor himself, Jerry Brown discovered details of his own past through the research of the journalist and historian Miriam Pawel, whose “The Browns of California: The Family Dynasty That Transformed a State and Shaped a Nation” traces California history via the Browns’ experience. Ms. Pawel and Mr. Brown discussed his life and family history at the City University of New York in Manhattan on Tuesday. Mr. Brown stressed the importance of understanding the past — of knowing one’s background, being rooted in time and place, and drawing on history as an anchor in times of disruption. “This idea of roots, of being grounded, becomes more salient the older I get and the more change I perceive,” he said. “As I got older, I noticed the rootedness I actually had in California.” Mr. Brown also spoke of a desire to disrupt and change when he left seminary to attend U.C. Berkeley and again when he first became governor in 1975. “Roots are not enough,” Mr. Brown said. “You need innovation, you need to blend opposites together in harmonious, greater integration. That’s what we’re having trouble with now.” "
1828,"A reader emailed The Times on Tuesday asking about our selection of photographs for President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett M. Kavanaugh, and the woman who has accused him of sexually assaulting her in high school, Christine Blasey Ford. “Why in this highly charged political atmosphere of TV and print news are we always seeing pictures of Brett Kavanaugh in a business suit looking sober and professional, and those of Dr. Blasey in informal clothing, sunglass wearing, wind in her hair, smiling as if for a travel brochure?” wrote Myrna Simms, from Tucson. “Equal representation? I think not.” We asked our photo editor in Washington, Marisa Schwartz Taylor, to respond: “We have tried several times to get more photos of Dr. Blasey (offering to have one of our photographers shoot a portrait of her and also asking if she could send us better photos of herself to publish), but she and her lawyers have declined all of our photo requests. “Judge Kavanaugh, on the other hand, has been photographed in public during his confirmation hearings and on visits to Capitol Hill by New York Times photographers. “We are very much looking forward to having new photos of Dr. Blasey to publish once the hearing starts on Thursday to provide a more accurate depiction of her.” "
1829,"The Times published a five-chapter special section last week elucidating the Trump-Russia story. The mammoth undertaking, by our investigative reporters Mark Mazzetti and Scott Shane, comprehensively lays out the key plot points and details of Moscow’s interference in the 2016 election — and what we’ve learned over the past two years. We asked readers to send us their questions about Russian meddling; the continuing investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III; and the reporting process for the special section. We received nearly 600 responses. Mark and Scott respond to a selection of the inquiries here. Did the Russians have anything to do with President Trump’s becoming the Republican candidate in the first place? Did Russia interfere in the primaries? MARK MAZZETTI Based on the timeline of events we have from Mr. Mueller’s indictments and from voluminous media reporting, the Russian operation to interfere in the election really didn’t begin in earnest until the spring of 2016, when Mr. Trump had mostly sewn up the Republican nomination. As we say in our story, it certainly must have been welcome news at the Kremlin that the one person to emerge from a very crowded field of Republican candidates was someone who advocated better ties to Russia. That said, we don’t know of any evidence that the Russians had a hand in helping the Trump campaign win the nomination. Is there any solid evidence that anyone actually voted for Mr. Trump instead of Hillary Clinton as a result of the fake accounts? "
1830,"President Trump said Wednesday that he hoped to present his long-anticipated peace plan for Israel and the Palestinians within four months, and said he favored a two-state solution to the decades of conflict between the two sides. Speaking before a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Trump was more declarative than he has previously been about both the timing and nature of the proposal his administration has been working on in secret for nearly 20 months. Mr. Trump said he liked a two-state solution, adding, “That’s what I think works best.” Previously, Mr. Trump has said that he was open to either a Palestinian state alongside Israel or a single Israeli state, and that the decision should be up to the parties. “I am looking at two-state, and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like,” he said in February 2017. [Read our live updates on the United Nations General Assembly, including a Security Council briefing that President Trump is chairing.] Asked to clarify his position at a news conference Wednesday evening, he said he would still be happy with any plan the Israelis and Palestinians agreed on, whether one state or two. “The bottom line, if the Israelis and the Palestinians want a one-state, that’s O.K. with me,” he said. “If they want two states, that’s O.K. with me.” "
1831,"Religious liberty has become a particularly politicized topic in recent years, and recent months were no different. In a long-awaited June decision, the Supreme Court decided in favor of a Christian baker who refused to make a custom wedding cake for a gay couple. In July, Attorney General Jeff Sessions introduced a “religious liberty task force” that critics saw as a mere cover for anti-gay discrimination. And Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s record has been scoured for evidence of what his appointment to the Supreme Court would mean for future decisions in which Christian beliefs clash with law and policy. But when it comes to religious liberty for Americans, there’s a disturbing trend that has drawn much less attention. In recent years, state lawmakers, lawyers and influential social commentators have been making the case that Muslims are not protected by the First Amendment. Why? Because, they argue, Islam is not a religion. This once seemed like an absurd fringe argument. But it has gained momentum. John Bennett, a Republican state legislator in Oklahoma, said in 2014, “Islam is not even a religion; it is a political system that uses a deity to advance its agenda of global conquest.” In 2015, a former assistant United States attorney, Andrew C. McCarthy, wrote in National Review that Islam “should be understood as conveying a belief system that is not merely, or even primarily, religious.” In 2016, Michael Flynn, who the next year was briefly President Trump’s national security adviser, told an ACT for America conference in Dallas that “Islam is a political ideology” that “hides behind the notion of it being a religion.” In a January 2018 news release, Neal Tapio of South Dakota, a Republican state senator who was planning to run for the United States House of Representatives, questioned whether the First Amendment applies to Muslims. The idea that Islam, which has over 1.6 billion adherents worldwide, is not a religion was even deployed in a 2010 legal challenge of county approval of building plans for a mosque in Murfreesboro, Tenn. The plaintiffs argued that Islam is not a religion but rather a geopolitical system bent on instituting jihadist and Shariah law in America. Because Islam is not a religion, the argument went, the mosque construction plans should not benefit from the county or federal laws that protect religious organizations. The local court ruled against the mosque, but the Tennessee appellate court overturned the ruling and the mosque prevailed. This argument about land use is particularly distressing because not too long ago, a bipartisan coalition in Congress helped enact the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act to prevent discriminatory or burdensome regulations from restricting religious exercise. In 2000, it passed both the House and the Senate by unanimous consent, as lawmakers expressed concern that minority faiths disproportionately faced zoning conflicts, and was signed into law by President Bill Clinton. It’s jarring that some would now argue that these protections do not apply to Muslims. At the root of the push to deny that Islam is a religion is a misguided belief that Muslims are anti-American. An industry of anti-Muslim fearmongering has helped stoke and perpetuate moral panic about Islam taking over America and subverting American values. "
1832,"The Trump administration is not the only government that has been busy slashing funds for environmental protection. Brazil has been doing the same. While Mr. Trump makes no bones about his desire to roll back environmental laws, Brazil’s president, Michel Temer, a signatory of the Paris climate agreement, has sent mixed signals. To his credit, Mr. Temer pledged in Paris to cut his country’s carbon dioxide emissions 37 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. His actions since then tell a different story. Last year, the Environment Ministry’s budget was cut nearly in half, as part of a national austerity plan amid Brazil’s punishing recession. And the agency responsible for protecting Brazil’s vast system of indigenous reserves is being virtually dismantled by draconian staff cuts. Funding for critical law enforcement to protect the rain forest from illegal timber cutting has also been decimated. In 2017, Brazil was the most dangerous country in the world for people defending the land or the environment, according to a tally by the group Global Witness, in collaboration with The Guardian newspaper. Forty-six people died. (The Pastoral Land Commission, a private advocacy group in Brazil for the rural poor, said at least 65 rural activists were murdered in disputes over development.) If the government’s retrenchment on environmental protection continues, there may soon be nothing to stop the chain saws on the Amazonian frontier, where the rule of law can be weak and land is frequently seized and cleared illegally. This has implications beyond Brazil. The Amazon’s lush forests make up the largest reserve of carbon dioxide on the surface of the earth. This potent greenhouse gas is released when forests are burned or bulldozed and left to decay. "
1833,"Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh was accused on Wednesday by another woman of engaging in sexual misconduct at parties while he was a student at Georgetown Preparatory School in the 1980s. The allegation came from Julie Swetnick, 55, who like Judge Kavanaugh, 53, grew up in the Washington suburbs. In a statement posted on Twitter by her lawyer, Ms. Swetnick said she observed the future Supreme Court nominee at parties where women were verbally abused, inappropriately touched, made “disoriented” with alcohol or drugs and “gang raped.” She said she witnessed Judge Kavanaugh participating in some of the misconduct, including lining up outside a bedroom where “numerous boys” were “waiting for their ‘turn’ with a girl inside the room.” Ms. Swetnick said she was raped at one of the parties and believed she had been drugged, but did not directly accuse Judge Kavanaugh of raping her. None of Ms. Swetnick’s claims could be independently corroborated by The New York Times, and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, declined to make her available for an interview. President Trump said on Twitter that Mr. Avenatti was a “third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations” and suggested he was “just looking for attention.” Mr. Avenatti rose to fame through his representation of Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels who has taken on Mr. Trump. The White House issued a statement from the judge describing the allegations as “ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone” and denying that he even knew Ms. Swetnick. “I don’t know who this is and this never happened,” the judge’s statement said. "
1834,"Updated Sept. 27, 2018: Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday about her allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. Follow our live coverage. WASHINGTON — Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh faced a whirlwind of new accusations on Wednesday that threatened to derail his nomination to the Supreme Court as key Republican senators wavered in their support and President Trump, in a rambling and combative news conference, acknowledged that he might be persuaded by the testimony of one of the judge’s female accusers. On the eve of an extraordinary hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee at which both Judge Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor who has accused him of assaulting her when they were both teenagers, will testify, Mr. Trump said that “some very evil” Democrats had plotted to destroy Judge Kavanaugh’s reputation. And he lamented what he called “a very dangerous period in our country” in which men are presumed guilty. But even as he described the charges against Judge Kavanaugh as “false accusations,” Mr. Trump seemed, for the first time, to acknowledge the mounting challenges facing his nominee. Asked why he repeatedly sides with men over their female accusers, the president said hearing stories from Dr. Blasey might change his mind. “I’m going to see what happens tomorrow,” Mr. Trump said during an hourlong news conference in New York, where he was attending the United Nations General Assembly. “I’m going to be watching, you know, believe it or not. It’s possible they will be convincing.” But the president admitted that his skepticism about Judge Kavanaugh’s accusers is rooted in his own anger about having himself been the target of what he considers false accusations of sexual misconduct. "
1835,"President Trump complained on Wednesday that “evil people,” including women in search of fame and fortune, routinely fabricate sexual assault charges against powerful men, and argued that his own experience with such allegations makes him more skeptical of the accusations threatening to bring down Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, his nominee for the Supreme Court. In a remarkable and rambling 83-minute news conference on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Trump was by turns combative, humorous and boastful. He defended Judge Kavanaugh and railed against what he called the “big, fat con job” that he said Democrats were perpetrating to derail the nomination, even as he suggested he could still jettison his pick depending on the outcome of a high-profile hearing on Thursday. Here are five takeaways from the extraordinary exchange: Mr. Trump stopped short of branding the three women accusing Judge Kavanaugh of sexual assault or misconduct as liars, although he did say his nominee faced “false accusations.” He said he was eager to hear the testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by Christine Blasey Ford, who has said Judge Kavanaugh assaulted her at a party in the 1980s when both were in high school. But the president made it clear that he believed his nominee and considered the allegations against the judge as part of a smear campaign hatched by Democrats, not credible charges. In doing so, Mr. Trump, as he has many times in the past, sided with a man accused of sexual misconduct rather than the women making those claims. And he made clear that his penchant for doing so is rooted in being accused of sexual assault himself — he says falsely — and his anger at having to contend with such allegations. “It does impact my opinion,” Mr. Trump told a reporter who asked about the parallel. “You know why? Because I’ve had a lot of false charges made against me.” “People want fame, they want money, they want whatever,” the president added. “So when I see it, I view it differently than somebody sitting home watching television where they say, ‘Oh, Judge Kavanaugh this or that.’ It’s happened to me many times.” "

__________ Calls for companies to eliminate quarterly earnings guidance are growing, but so is the number of companies issuing them. Warren E. Buffett, the head of Berkshire Hathaway, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, and Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, have all criticized quarterly guidance. They have said it hinders a company’s ability to achieve long-term goals and should be ended. But last year, 146 companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index provided earnings guidance 444 times, according to S & P Global Market Intelligence. That was the highest number in a decade, and the pace doesn’t appear to have slowed much this year. As of Sept. 12, 128 companies in the S. & P. 500 had provided quarterly guidance 321 times. If Federal Reserve policy is no longer accommodative, then what is it? Since the financial crisis, the central bank had described monetary policy as accommodative. But the word was dropped from Wednesday’s policy statement. That’s an indication that the Fed’s benchmark interest rate is rising back to a level that it regards as neutral or, in other words, neither stimulating nor restraining economic growth. Some have speculated that the removal of the language would be a dovish signal. But at a news conference Wednesday, the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said: “The change does not signal any change in the likely path of policy. Instead, it is a sign that policy is proceeding in line with our expectations.” The Fed and trade. As it sets monetary policy, the Fed is monitoring the effect on the economy of President Trump’s trade measures, which include tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as a wide range of imports from China. The tariffs could push up costs for companies and consumers and make it harder for United States exporters as other countries retaliate. During the news conference, Mr. Powell sounded more concerned about the economic consequences of the trade battle than he had at past meetings: “We’ve been hearing a rising chorus of concerns from businesses all over the country about the disruption of supply chains, materials costs increases and loss of markets.” But Mr. Powell said the Fed had not seen much evidence in the numbers that the trade tensions were harming the economy. “It’s hard to see much happening at this point,” he said. Mr. Powell warned, however, about a situation in which tariffs remained in place for a long time and the world became more protectionist. “That’s going to be bad for the United States economy and American workers and families, and also for other economies,” he said. "
1837,"Sometime after he doubted the character of George Washington (“Didn’t he have a couple things in his past?”), urged a wire-service reporter to ask a tough question (“Give it to me, Reuters!”) and referred to a Kurdish correspondent as “Mr. Kurd,” President Trump paused to directly address the dozens of journalists who had gathered for a rare solo news conference. “Can you imagine,” he said, “if you didn’t have me?” Mr. Trump denounces news organizations as “the enemy of the people.” His supporters turned “fake news” into a political rallying cry. And the daily White House press briefing is all but a thing of the past. But in 80 minutes on Wednesday, Mr. Trump made clear that he is never more comfortable, never more engaged, than when he is sparring with the news media that he loves to say he hates. Back on his native turf — a hotel ballroom in Midtown Manhattan, five blocks from Trump Tower — the president strolled onto the stage like a prizefighter eager for the opening bell. An hour later, his enjoyment of the occasion had only increased. “I could be doing this all day long,” Mr. Trump said happily, after an hour of challenging, cajoling, teasing and shouting down the reporters in the room. “Should we do some more?” He worked the crowd. Instead of merely calling on Steve Holland of Reuters, Mr. Trump called him “a high-quality person,” adding, “Now he’ll probably hit me with a bad one.” "
1838,"WASHINGTON — Google executives, after months of mostly avoiding the harsh spotlight put on their internet peers, are being grilled in Washington this week by lawmakers questioning if the Silicon Valley giant is living up to its promise to be a neutral arbiter of online information. On Friday, Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, will meet with Representative Kevin McCarthy, of California, the Republican House majority leader and a vocal critic of Google, and more than two dozen Republicans to discuss complaints the company is trying to silence conservative voices. “Google has a lot of questions to answer about reports of bias in its search results, violations of user privacy, anticompetitive behavior, and business dealings with repressive regimes like China,” Mr. McCarthy said in a statement. The Friday meeting will cap a week of tech-related sessions in Washington in which Google — in the cross hairs of Silicon Valley’s conservative critics since late summer — has played a starring role. At a gathering of the heads of the Justice Department and a dozen state attorneys general on Tuesday, Google was mentioned more than any other company when it came to concerns about antitrust enforcement and privacy practices, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity. At a Senate hearing discussing online privacy on Wednesday, Google’s chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, received the toughest and broadest array of questions from lawmakers who wanted to know about the company’s consideration of introducing search services in China. Google says it is not close to starting such a service. "
1839,"Christine Blasey Ford is scheduled to address the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday about sexual assault allegations she made against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court. The following are prepared remarks of Dr. Blasey’s opening statement, as released by the Judiciary Committee. [For further coverage of the hearing follow our live briefing.] _________________ CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD: Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, members of the committee. My name is Christine Blasey Ford. I am a professor of psychology at Palo Alto University and a research psychologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine. I was an undergraduate at the University of North Carolina and earned my degree in experimental psychology in 1988. I received a master’s degree in 1991 in clinical psychology from Pepperdine University. In 1996, I received a Ph.D. in educational psychology from the University of Southern California. I earned a master’s degree in epidemiology from the Stanford University School of Medicine in 2009. I have been married to Russell Ford since 2002 and we have two children. I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school. I have described the events publicly before. I summarized them in my letter to Ranking Member Feinstein, and again in my letter to Chairman Grassley. I understand and appreciate the importance of your hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact it has had on my life and on my family. I grew up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. I attended the Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Md., from 1980 to 1984. Holton-Arms is an all-girls school that opened in 1901. During my time at the school, girls at Holton-Arms frequently met and became friendly with boys from all-boys schools in the area, including Landon School, Georgetown Prep, Gonzaga high school, country clubs, and other places where kids and their families socialized. This is how I met Brett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me. "
1840,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said he rejected a meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada during the United Nations General Assembly this week and threatened on Wednesday to punish Canada by taxing the cars it exports into America, signaling a new low in relations between the two nations. Mr. Trump’s comments come after months of tense trade negotiations between Canada and the United States have failed to produce an agreement and as the White House prepares to move ahead with a bilateral trade deal with just Mexico. “Frankly, we’re thinking about just taxing cars coming in from Canada,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference on Wednesday. “That’s the mother lode. That’s the big one. We’re very unhappy with the negotiations and the negotiating style of Canada.” Trade tensions between the United States and Canada have been rising for months, and relations between Mr. Trump and Mr. Trudeau have soured amid disagreements over the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Trump said he turned down a meeting with Mr. Trudeau because Canada had treated the United States “very badly” and because of its high dairy tariffs, which are preventing the United States from selling milk into Canada. A spokesman for Mr. Trudeau said the prime minister never requested such a meeting. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump appeared to snub Mr. Trudeau when he did not stand to shake the Canadian prime minister’s hand during a lunch at the United Nations summit meeting. Mr. Trudeau said the two leaders did not meet because their schedules were full of meetings with leaders from far-flung countries. "
1841,"Last week, after Christine Blasey Ford publicly accused Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, of sexual assault, a torrent of false and misleading allegations about Dr. Blasey surfaced online, many of them originating on social media. We debunked five of those claims. Now, more women have come forward with public accusations of sexual assault against Judge Kavanaugh, including Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Judge Kavanaugh’s, and Julie Swetnick, who said she had observed the nominee at parties in the 1980s where women were verbally abused and “gang raped.” And viral rumors, hoaxes and distortions about Judge Kavanaugh’s accusers are still swirling around social media. Here are five of the most widely spread false and misleading allegations, along with explanations of how they went viral. This week, two distinct — but equally false — rumors spread about links between Judge Kavanaugh’s accusers and George Soros, the liberal billionaire and Democratic megadonor. (Mr. Soros makes frequent appearances in internet conspiracy theories.) "
1842,"And then there were three. Three women — Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick — are now accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct as a teenager and young adult. The allegations include assault, attempted rape and, now, that he and other boys attempted “to cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so that they could then be ‘gang raped’ in a side room or bedroom by a ‘train’ of numerous boys.” Swetnick, the latest accuser, described Kavanaugh as a “mean drunk.” This is explosive, extraordinary stuff. However, Kavanaugh has categorically denied that any of this ever happened. In an interview on Fox News, Kavanaugh said that he had always “treated women with dignity and respect” and that he “did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter.” I must say that I found his specification of sexual “intercourse” interesting here. First, sexual assault doesn’t require intercourse. Second, one can be sexually intimate — or sexually violated — without intercourse. That struck me as a bit of carefully chosen lawyer-speak. To be clear, these accusations don’t paint Kavanaugh as just a cad, but as a lascivious predator. If these things are true, not only must he never be seated on the Supreme Court, he must also lose his current judgeship. "
1843,"President Trump said Wednesday that he has years to reach an agreement with North Korea to rid the country of nuclear weapons, reversing the position he took a year ago that Pyongyang had to disarm rapidly. “I don’t want to get into the time game,” he said at a news conference late in the day, after serving as chairman of a United Nations Security Council meeting on nuclear proliferation. “I got all the time in the world,” Mr. Trump said. “I don’t have to rush it.” Mr. Trump’s statement came despite satellite photographs and other evidence that have led American intelligence agencies to conclude that North Korea continues to produce nuclear fuel and fabricate it into weapons. American officials estimate that the country now has between 20 and 60 nuclear weapons, and the number may be rising. But Mr. Trump argued that the halt in nuclear and missile testing by North Korea — and a series of private letters exchanged with Kim Jong-un, the country’s leader — had taken the urgency out of the disarmament issue. “If it takes two years, three years or five months,” Mr. Trump said, suggesting that the timeline for North Korea to surrender its nuclear weapons was flexible. When Mr. Trump was running for office, he criticized his predecessors for letting North Korea continue to expand its arsenal while engaging the United States in lengthy and ultimately fruitless negotiations. "
1844,"Huddled under umbrellas outside a suburban Philadelphia courthouse on Tuesday, a group of women embraced. They laughed and cried in the rain as the news sunk in: Inside, Bill Cosby, whom they had all accused of sexual assault, was just  sentenced to three to 10 years in prison, punishment for violating one woman, Andrea Constand. Across the country, many more women joined in that victory, a win for a movement that began with a hashtag and trickled up to real consequences in the highest halls of culture and power. It was for them proof that the slings and arrows that women have endured for eons are now weaponized to not just topple, but to convict culpable men at the apex of their game. “This is a milestone because somebody finally got justice,” said Rocky Pierson, 22, a podcaster from St. Paul. “We look at people who have such a high profile as untouchable,” she said. “This chips away at that.” But at the very same moment, another milestone of the #MeToo movement has cracked open deep fractures in American society. Just over 120 miles to the south, issues of sexual assault racked the nation’s capital and the country, as a third woman came forward on Wednesday with accusations against a man who stands to become one of the most powerful of those accused so far: Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s Supreme Court pick. "
1845,"Updated Sept. 27, 2018 Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh testified Thursday in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee about accusations of sexual assault leveled against him by Christine Blasey Ford. The following is the transcript of Judge Kavanaugh’s opening statement, as prepared by The New York Times. [For further coverage of the hearing, follow our live briefing.] _________________ JUDGE BRETT M. KAVANAUGH: Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Feinstein, members of the committee, thank you for allowing me to make my statement. I wrote it myself yesterday afternoon and evening. No one has seen a draft of it except for one of my former law clerks. This is my statement. Less than two weeks ago, Dr. Ford publicly accused me of committing wrongdoing at an event more than 36 years ago when we were both in high school. I denied the allegation immediately, categorically and unequivocally. All four people allegedly at the event, including Dr. Ford’s longtime friend, Ms. Keyser, have said they recall no such event. Her longtime friend, Ms. Keyser, said under penalty of felony that she does not know me and does not believe she ever saw me at a party ever. Here’s the quote from Ms. Keyser’s attorney’s letter. “Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present with or without Dr. Ford.” Think about that fact. The day after the allegation appeared, I told this committee that I wanted a hearing as soon as possible to clear my name. I demanded a hearing for the very next day. Unfortunately, it took the committee 10 days to get to this hearing. In those 10 long days, as was predictable and as I predicted, my family and my name have been totally and permanently destroyed by vicious and false additional accusations. The 10-day delay has been harmful to me and my family, to the Supreme Court and to the country. When this allegation first arose, I welcomed any kind of investigation. Senate, F.B.I. or otherwise. The committee now has conducted a thorough investigation, and I’ve cooperated fully. I know that any kind of investigation, Senate, F.B.I., Montgomery County police, whatever will clear me. Listen to the people I know. Listen to the people that have known me my whole life. Listen to the people that I’ve grown up with and worked with and played with and coached with and dated and taught and gone to games with and had beers with. And listen to the witnesses who allegedly were at this event 36 years ago. Listen to Ms. Keyser. She does not know me. I was not at the party described by Dr. Ford. This confirmation process has become a national disgrace. The Constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process. But you have replaced “advice and consent” with “search and destroy.” "
1846,"Brett Kavanaugh is a “great gentleman,” President Trump said at a White House news conference last week. “I feel so badly for him. This is not a man who deserves this.” At no point on that occasion did Mr. Trump say the name of the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who had accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexual assault. After further allegations about Judge Kavanaugh’s behavior were reported on Sunday night, Mr. Trump doubled down: What was going on was “most unfair” to Judge Kavanaugh, who is “an outstanding person.”

When it comes to the moral deficiencies exhibited by Mr. Trump and other supporters of the judge, many critics speak about lack of empathy as the problem. It isn’t. Mr. Trump, as he has shown clearly in the Kavanaugh confirmation process, seems to have no difficulty taking another person’s perspective, and then feeling and expressing a sympathetic or congruent moral emotion. The real problem is that the people Mr. Trump feels with and for are most frequently powerful men who have been credibly accused of serious crimes and wrongdoing. He felt sorry for Michael Flynn, referring to him as a “good guy.” More recently, he felt bad for Paul Manafort. And, in the case of Judge Kavanaugh, Mr. Trump feels sorry for a man accused of sexual assault while erasing and dismissing the perspective of his female accusers. Mr. Trump is manifesting what I call “himpathy” — the inappropriate and disproportionate sympathy powerful men often enjoy in cases of sexual assault, intimate partner violence, homicide and other misogynistic behavior. There is a plethora of recent cases, from the Stanford swimmer Brock Turner to the Maryland school gunman Austin Rollins, fitting this general pattern: discussion focuses excessively on the perpetrator’s perspective, on the potential pain driving him or on the loss of his bright future. And the higher a man rises in the social hierarchy, the more himpathy he tends to attract. Thus, the bulk of our collective care, consideration, respect and nurturing attention is allotted to the most privileged in our society. Once you learn to spot himpathy, it becomes difficult not to see it everywhere: in men such as the former editor of The New York Review of Books Ian Buruma, who published a self-indulgent essay by a former Canadian talk-show host accused of sexual assault and harassment by more than 20 women; in women like the five Republicans whom CNN convened recently to voice support for Judge Kavanaugh (“Tell me, what boy hasn’t done this in high school?” asked one, shrugging himpathetically). But we’re in a moment during which himpathy is so thoroughly on display, in such a public way, that the time is ripe to push for a mass moral reckoning. What the Kavanaugh case has revealed this week is that himpathy can, at its most extreme, become full-blown gendered sociopathy: a pathological moral tendency to feel sorry exclusively for the alleged male perpetrator — it was too long ago; he was just a boy; it was a case of mistaken identity — while relentlessly casting suspicion upon the female accusers. It also reveals the far-ranging repercussions of this worldview: It’s no coincidence that many of those who himpathize with Judge Kavanaugh to the exclusion of Dr. Blasey are also avid abortion opponents, a position that requires a refusal to empathize with girls and women facing an unwanted pregnancy. "
1847,"It’s been a long time since I last thought about the Technical Virgins Association. The T.V.A. — which is not to be confused with the people who generate electricity in the Tennessee Valley — was a joke my friends and I made up early in our college careers. It referred to the then-popular idea that girls could go as far as they wanted with a boy as long as everything stayed, um, intact. All of this brings us to Brett Kavanaugh, who appears to have been a T.V.A. member. “Never had sexual intercourse with anyone in high school?” asked a Fox interviewer. “Correct,” said a somber Supreme Court nominee, who added that he had maintained that record for “many years after.” Except maybe not. “Perhaps Brett Kavanaugh was a virgin for many years after high school. But he claimed otherwise in a conversation with me during our freshman year in Lawrance Hall at Yale, in the living room of my suite,” tweeted a history professor at the University of Wisconsin. The professor, Stephen Kantrowitz, said he remembered Kavanaugh’s account of losing his virginity distinctly “because it was the first time I had had such a conversation with an acquaintance who was not a friend.” So, people, it sounds as if a young Brett Kavanaugh was bragging — to virtual strangers — about having done the deed. That was, of course, before he was nominated to the Supreme Court and became a charter member of the T.V.A. "
1848,"The Reader Center is one way we in the newsroom are trying to connect with you, by highlighting your perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work. On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will question Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the first of three women who have accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct when he was a young man. Peter Baker, our chief White House correspondent, responded to readers’ questions about the hearing and Judge Kavanaugh’s prospects of confirmation on Facebook Live on Wednesday. Below are excerpts from the segment, which have been edited and condensed. Right now, we have a 51-to-49 Senate. That means Republicans have 51 seats and can only afford to lose one vote if the Democrats don’t go along with Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. If the Republicans lose one senator, Vice President Mike Pence will have the tiebreaking vote, and they can still confirm Judge Kavanaugh. If they lose two Republican senators and don’t get any Democrats, this confirmation is over. That’s why Thursday is so important. "
1849,"Updated Nov. 7, 2018: President Trump forced out Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday and announced Matthew Whitaker, Mr. Sessions’s chief of staff, will take over as acting attorney general. Read the latest, here. WASHINGTON — Convinced that the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, was ready to resign after the revelation that he suggested President Trump was unfit for the job, senior White House aides got to work last weekend installing a replacement. Matthew G. Whitaker, the chief of staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, would become the acting No. 2 official at the Justice Department, his White House counterpart, John F. Kelly, told him over the phone on Saturday morning, according to two people briefed on the call. To the White House, he was an obvious choice: a confident former college football player and United States attorney whom Mr. Kelly has privately described as the West Wing’s “eyes and ears” in a department the president has long considered at war with him. By late Monday morning, the plan was moot. Mr. Rosenstein was no longer committed to resigning, at least without assurances he was doing so on amicable terms with the president. Mr. Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he was open to keeping Mr. Rosenstein in place, and two White House officials said they believed he was likely to remain in his job at least through the midterm elections. But the arrangements to promote Mr. Whitaker show how White House aides seized on the days of uncertainty about Mr. Rosenstein to try to place a trusted loyalist at the top of a department whose traditional independence has long frustrated the president. Mr. Rosenstein has incurred Mr. Trump’s wrath because he appointed a special counsel for the Russia investigation, though thanks to complex department rules, Mr. Whitaker would not assume control of the inquiry if he ever replaces Mr. Rosenstein. By contrast, Mr. Whitaker cuts the kind of central-casting figure whom Mr. Trump prefers, and he has served as what one White House aide called a “balm” on the relationship between the president and the Justice Department. He has frequently visited the Oval Office and is said to have an easy chemistry with Mr. Trump. On Monday morning, Mr. Trump himself called Mr. Whitaker, not with an explicit job offer but a reassurance that he has faith in him. "
1850,"There are so many issues breaking right now that it’s hard to keep track — and focusing on any one leads to feelings of guilt about neglecting the others. But it’s worth remembering that the Trump trade war still seems to be on track, and important to have a sense of its effects. The view within the Trump administration is, of course, that “trade wars are good, and easy to win.” Where does this view come from? Actually, it involves two propositions. First, it takes the mercantilist view under which trade as a zero-sum game in which whoever sells more wins. Because the U.S. runs a trade deficit, we’re losers, and anything that reduces that trade deficit is good. Second, it takes for granted the proposition that precisely because the U.S. exports less to other countries than we buy in return, a trade war will hurt them more than it hurts us, reducing U.S. imports more than it reduces U.S. exports. Now, anyone who looks at the actual effects of international trade knows that the first proposition is wrong: trade isn’t just about selling stuff, it’s about getting better, cheaper stuff both to consume and to use as inputs in production. But you might assume that at least the second proposition is true: a round of tariff retaliation should reduce foreign exports to the U.S. more than it reduces U.S. exports to the rest of the world, simply because those foreign exports are bigger to start with. But maybe not. A new study from the European Central Bank suggests that even though the U.S. runs trade deficits, a trade war would reduce demand for U.S. goods more than it would reduce demand in the rest of the world. The Bank of England has reached a similar conclusion. "
1851,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused him of sexually assaulting her when they were in high school, are scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee today, beginning at 10 a.m. Eastern. Read about their preparations. For Judge Kavanaugh, the challenge is to avoid looking like he is attacking his accusers. Dr. Blasey, for her part, will be questioned by a veteran sex crimes prosecutor, a scenario that could rattle the most seasoned witness. At stake is a swing seat on a Supreme Court that is divided ideologically between four conservatives and four liberals, and all this before midterm elections that will determine which party controls Congress. • Updates: Our live briefing will have the latest. • Prepared remarks: Here are transcripts of what Dr. Blasey and Judge Kavanaugh plan to tell senators today. She will testify first. "
1852,"There is a reason Thursday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing will be short and feature only two witnesses, the Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser Christine Blasey Ford. Republicans have designed the hearing to end in a “he said, she said” stalemate. No matter how credible Dr. Blasey is, isolating her as a lone accuser is the most effective political strategy for confirming Judge Kavanaugh. His strategy will be simple: categorical denial. Republicans will insist, despite the swirling uncertainty, including a third woman who came forward Wednesday with sexual misconduct allegations against him, that Judge Kavanaugh deserves the benefit of the doubt and should be confirmed. Republicans will then be able to claim that fairness had been served because both witnesses were heard. But Americans, denied the testimony of other relevant witnesses who could support Dr. Blasey’s account and denied an F.B.I. investigation into other evidence, won’t be any closer to the truth. If the Judiciary Committee votes to confirm Judge Kavanaugh on Friday and the full Senate follows as early as this weekend, as some Republicans insist, there will be a furious backlash. The Supreme Court will be left under another cloud of possible perjury. Dr. Blasey is not a lone accuser. Since her account was first published by The Washington Post on Sept. 16, considerable corroborating evidence has emerged, but none of it will be properly examined at Thursday’s hearing. Besides Julie Swetnick, Deborah Ramirez has accused Judge Kavanaugh of exposing himself and touching her while they were both students at Yale. This week four people who know Dr. Blasey, including her husband, signed affidavits and submitted them to the Judiciary Committee saying she told them about being sexually assaulted by Judge Kavanaugh before he was nominated by President Trump. Their statements provide important corroboration, and if the Senate was really interested in learning the truth, these people would be called to testify. "

hat does The New York Times sound like? I remember this question coming up a couple of years ago in New York with editors who were trying to figure out how The Times should explore audio. The good news now is that more than one answer has emerged. To get a sense of what I mean, listen to this week’s New York Times Magazine. It’s the annual voyages issue recast as an audio journey through soundscapes in cities and in outlandishly remote locations worldwide, with interviews to add context. I admit, it took me a while to find the time to explore it (total listening time is only 30 minutes), but I was grateful when I did. In addition to learning about rat laughter in New York City, I came away with a new appreciation for lava and lemurs, while also revisiting Chile’s crunching and cracking Atacama Desert. The magazine’s experiment was a clear reminder of just how quickly journalism can evolve. Audio in particular is having a moment. Think podcasts. Think Alexa, Siri and Google Home. At The Times, our sound has gone from virtually nonexistent to rich, varied and a regular part of what we do. "
1854,"WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency plans to dissolve its Office of the Science Advisor, a senior post that was created to counsel the E.P.A. administrator on the scientific research underpinning health and environmental regulations, according to a person familiar with the agency’s plans. The person spoke anonymously because the decision had not yet been made public. The science adviser works across the agency to ensure that the highest quality science is integrated into the agency’s policies and decisions, according to the E.P.A.’s website. The move is the latest among several steps taken by the Trump administration that appear to have diminished the role of scientific research in policymaking while the administration pursues an agenda of rolling back regulations. Asked about the E.P.A.’s plans, John Konkus, a spokesman for the agency, emailed a prepared statement from the science adviser, Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, in which she described the decision to dissolve the office as one that would “combine offices with similar functions” and “eliminate redundancies.” In an email, Dr. Orme-Zavaleta referred questions to the E.P.A.’s public affairs office. Dr. Orme-Zavaleta is an expert on the risks of chemicals to human health who has worked at the E.P.A. since 1981, according to the agency’s website. It was unclear whether she would remain at the E.P.A. once the decision takes effect. Separately, on Tuesday, in an unusual move, the E.P.A. placed the head of its Office of Children’s Health, Dr. Ruth Etzel, on administrative leave, while declining to give a reason for the move. Agency officials told Dr. Etzel, a respected pediatric epidemiologist, that the move was not disciplinary. As the head of an office that regularly pushed to tighten regulations on pollution, which can affect children more powerfully than adults, Dr. Etzel had clashed multiple times with Trump administration appointees who sought to loosen pollution rules. Michael Mikulka, who heads a union representing about 900 E.P.A. employees, said, “Clearly, this is an attempt to silence voices whether it’s in the agency’s Office of Children’s Health or the Office of the Science Advisor to kill career civil servants’ input and scientific perspectives on rule-making.” "
1855,"WASHINGTON — Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh and his accuser faced off Thursday in an extraordinary, emotional day of testimony that ricocheted from a woman’s tremulous account of sexual assault to a man’s angry, outraged denial, all of which played out for hours before a riveted nation and a riven Senate. The two very different versions of the truth, unfolding in the heated atmosphere of gender divides, #MeToo and the Trump presidency, could not be reconciled. The testimony skittered from cringe-worthy sexual details to accusations and denials of drunken debauchery to one juvenile exchange over flatulence. Washington has not seen anything like it in a generation. For people not used to watching government in action, it was a spectacle of tantrums, tears, preening and political ambition — what Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, called, “Sadly one of the most shameful chapters in the history of the United States Senate.” [Four key takeaways from the hearing.] Senators must ultimately take sides, and their decisions in the coming days will determine not only the fate of Judge Kavanaugh, President Trump’s second nominee to the Supreme Court, but also the ideological balance of the court for decades. In the end, the judge’s future most likely rests with a handful of undecided Republican senators — Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Jeff Flake of Arizona — and one Democrat, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia. At least Mr. Flake, who sits on the Judiciary Committee, will have to render a decision in short order: Republican senators emerged Thursday evening from a closed-door meeting, pledging to push ahead with a committee vote scheduled for Friday morning, which would advance the nomination to the full Senate. Alone among the Republicans, the Arizona senator seemed to be wrestling with how to reconcile the competing accounts. “There is doubt,” he said. “We’ll never move beyond that.” Mr. Trump watched the testimony of Judge Kavanaugh’s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, on Air Force One as he flew back from New York, where he had been attending the United Nations General Assembly. Immediately after the hearing adjourned, he praised Judge Kavanaugh’s testimony on Twitter, saying that the judge had “showed America exactly why I nominated him.” "
1856,"WASHINGTON — At the beginning of the day, she was asked if she was sure that he was the one who sexually assaulted her 36 years ago. “One hundred percent,” she said. At the end of the day, he was asked if he was certain he had not. “One hundred percent,” he said. One after the other, Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh sat in the same chair before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, separated by less than an hour but a reality gulf so wide that their conflicting accounts of what happened when they were teenagers cannot be reconciled. With millions of Americans alternately riveted and horrified by the televised drama, Dr. Blasey and Judge Kavanaugh left no room for compromise, no possibility of confusion, no chance that they remembered something differently. In effect, they asked senators to choose which one they believed. And in that moment, these two 100-percent realities came to embody a society divided into broader realities so disparate and so incompatible that it feels as if two countries are living in the borders of one. It has become something of a cliché to say that the United States has become increasingly tribal in the era of President Trump, with each side in its own corner, believing what it chooses to believe and looking for reinforcement in the media and politics. But the battle over Judge Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination has reinforced those divisions at the intersection of sex, politics, power and the law. Senators emerged from Thursday’s hearing bitterly split into those tribes, with Democrats persuaded by Dr. Blasey’s calm and unflustered account of being shoved onto a bed, pawed, nearly stripped and prevented from screaming for help, while Republicans were moved by Judge Kavanaugh, who bristled with red-faced outrage and grievance at what he called an orchestrated campaign to destroy his life. [Four takeaways from the hearing.] By Thursday night, only a few of the 100 who will decide Judge Kavanaugh’s fate remained undecided, searching for answers where none were readily available. “There is doubt,” said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona. “We’ll never move beyond that. And just have a little humility on that front.” "
1857,"Three days before a bitterly contested congressional primary, Representative Dan Donovan, the Republican incumbent, wanted to leave no doubt with voters at an anti-tax rally that he was the candidate preferred by President Trump. Lawn signs and placards would not be enough: His campaign unveiled a mobile two-story-tall billboard that blared Mr. Trump’s endorsement. But after Mr. Donovan defeated his rival, Michael Grimm, the former congressman and federal tax felon, in June, Mr. Donovan’s embrace of Mr. Trump is something less than full-throated. Gone are the lawn signs that paired Mr. Donovan’s name with the Trump logo; in their place are signs that proclaim “Solutions, Results.” As Mr. Donovan, the city’s lone Republican congressman, faces a feisty challenge in the general election from the Democratic candidate, Max Rose, Mr. Donovan seems to be moving toward the center. In a district that has more registered Democrats than Republicans, yet skews heavily conservative, the question now is whether Mr. Trump’s support may hurt more than it helps in November. The issue is one that is playing out across the country, but is particularly germane in New York City, where Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular. "
1858,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday that the world is at “the dawn of a new day” in confronting the threat posed by North Korea’s weapons programs but that sanctions against the country must continue for now. In a speech before the United Nations Security Council, Mr. Pompeo said President Trump’s summit meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, had laid the groundwork for the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. But he told the council that until that process is complete, the world must abide by the economic sanctions still in place against the government in Pyongyang. “We must not forget what’s brought us this far: the historic international pressure campaign that this council has made possible through the sanctions that it imposed,” Mr. Pompeo said. Mr. Pompeo was leading the meeting of the 15-member council during the United Nations General Assembly meeting. On Wednesday, he met with his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong-ho. Next month he will travel to Pyongyang, in part to set the stage for a second meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim. In his speech, Mr. Pompeo said special attention needed to be paid to strict limits on North Korea’s imports of oil, ending its exports of coal and curbing its practice of sending workers to other countries as a means of earning hard currency.

He does it well, alongside his co-star Lady Gaga, on the newly released song “Shallow” from the soundtrack to his upcoming “A Star Is Born” remake. The movie’s much-memed trailer featured part of the track, and the “Shallow” video includes more snippets from the film, which is out Oct. 5. • The Times’s Taffy Brodesser-Akner also sat down with Cooper, whose desire not to get personal in talking about “A Star” inspired a profile about life and art, and how both intertwine in the negotiation of the celebrity interview. “If you really want to know him, you can’t sit with him and ask him,” writes Brodesser-Akner. “You have to watch his movie. You have to feel it. You have to be willing to accept answers that are spiritual and not literal.” [NY Times] "
1860,"Maybe it’s the people of Mexico who should be chanting, “Build that wall!” After they see the new Netflix reality series “Made in Mexico,” which premieres on Friday, they may wish they hadn’t allowed such a free flow of manufactured drama, self-promotion and crocodile tears across the border from the United States. Focusing on nine young socialites (Netflix’s word) living intertwined lives in the wealthier precincts of Mexico City, “Made in Mexico” is an aspirational-reality show that sits about halfway between “Real Housewives” messiness and “Terrace House” tidiness. In the two episodes available for review, violence is limited to some clumsy bull-riding and the dramatic knocking over of a glass of water. That has something to do with the subjects, who are generally well mannered and thoughtful and don’t appear to do much drinking (except for the one who does). But it also may have to do with the show’s makers, Love Productions USA, the Los Angeles-based American arm of the company best known for “The Great British Bake-Off” (retitled “The Great British Baking Show” by PBS). Like all reality shows of its type, “Made in Mexico” presents a parallel world of artificial intimacy and fabricated intrigue. In this case, though, the cocooning effect is more noticeable. The show moves in a glitter-zone of skyscrapers, luxury apartments, expensive restaurants and family horse ranches. The non-glamorous are kept in the background. One of the socialites, who claims to be descended from an Aztec emperor, says of her circle, “Mexico City is very closed” — the metropolitan area’s 21 million other residents apparently slipped her mind. Would a Mexican or other Latin-American production company have done things differently? Perhaps they wouldn’t have used such obvious cultural signifiers as Aztec dancers in the Zócalo or the gondolas of the Xochimilco canals to add local color. "
1861,"Eric Reid, the N.F.L. safety whose kneeling protest alongside Colin Kaepernick stirred one of the league’s biggest controversies in years, signed a free-agent deal with the Carolina Panthers on Thursday. Reid, a Pro Bowl-caliber defensive back, was a standout for five seasons with the San Francisco 49ers, but he became a lightning rod in 2016 when he joined Kaepernick, then the team’s quarterback, in kneeling on the sideline during the national anthem to protest police brutality and societal inequity for people of color. Last season, as Kaepernick remained unsigned, Reid continued the protest. The 26-year-old Reid entered free agency as one of the top players at his position, but remained unsigned even as safeties with less impressive résumés, like Tre Boston and Kenny Vaccaro, found jobs. Like Kaepernick, he filed a grievance against the league, claiming the teams were colluding to keep him out of the N.F.L. The status of the Reid’s grievance is unclear now that he has been signed. It is also unclear what impact Reid’s signing will have on Kaepernick’s grievance, which last month survived a motion by the N.F.L. to have it dismissed. After the announcement, Kaepernick congratulated his former teammate on Twitter. Kaepernick said Reid “should have been signed the 1st day of free agency” and “he was the 1st person 2 kneel alongside me.” "
1862,"Across the country, Americans tuned their televisions Thursday to the live footage of two lives, and two stories, brought together in Room 226 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. After the TV countdown clocks ticked down to the 10 a.m. opening, Christine Blasey Ford came forward for the first time on camera to describe the night that altered her life forever, when, she says, a 17-year-old Brett M. Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her. Hours later, Judge Kavanaugh came before the committee and delivered a blistering defense of his reputation and denied Dr. Ford’s allegations. Like the Watergate hearings, the O.J. Simpson trial, the Anita Hill hearings before it, the hearing on Judge Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination collectively riveted the nation, with political history unfolding in real time. While many people went about their days, other Americans watched in hopes of seeing, finally, a fuller portrait of Dr. Blasey, a Palo Alto University professor who for days had been mostly known from a blurry photo that showed her smiling, in a happier moment, behind a pair of wraparound glasses. They watched to analyze the work of Rachel Mitchell, a sex-crimes prosecutor from Maricopa County, Ariz., who was plucked from relative obscurity by Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee to question Dr. Blasey. "
1863,"BEIJING — China stoutly defended on Thursday its right to publish in an American newspaper a supplement that President Trump attacked as interfering in the United States elections, saying the publication was lawful and commonplace. But some liberal Chinese analysts said the four-page supplement, paid for by China Daily, an English language newspaper that adheres closely to the dictates of the Communist Party, showed a lack of judgment, and left China exposed to the president’s criticism. The supplement, which appeared on Sunday in The Des Moines Register, was designed to resemble news articles looking at the economic costs of Mr. Trump’s trade war with China. Many farmers in Iowa are particularly dependent on global trade. Speaking at the United Nations Security Council, where China’s foreign minister was also present, Mr. Trump said: “Regrettably, we’ve found that China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election, coming up in November, against my administration.” He did not offer any evidence of such interference. In a tweet, he later described the supplement as propaganda made to look like news. Pointing to United States laws that allow foreign outlets to “cooperate” with American media organizations, the Chinese Foreign Ministry stressed that many countries paid for supplements that portray a nation in flattering ways. Many of those supplements are designed to look like regular news articles that promote tourism or foreign investment. "
1864,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Gavin Newsom made a national name for himself as mayor of San Francisco when he endorsed gay marriage, going against the federal government and his own Democratic Party. Then he became California’s lieutenant governor, a position that has given him little authority but plenty of time to prepare for the job he wants next: governor. Mr. Newsom is the heavy favorite against his Republican opponent, John Cox. At his recent events he has barely mentioned his campaign, instead focusing on supporting Democrats running for Congress. We spoke with Mr. Newsom in a series of interviews on his campaign bus. Below are several outtakes, which have been lightly edited and condensed. Q. How do you answer the question of whether California is a success or failure? A. It has been a success — an extraordinary success. Gov. Jerry Brown’s model of not being profligate but progressive is a new model for Democrats. There’s a growing anxiety of how we measure economic prosperity, and California is a poster child for why that’s a legitimate debate. Service economy, low-wage workers working full time without workers comp benefits, uninsured — that’s where we are struggling. We have these high-wage, high-skill jobs. And then you have a third of the population — I’m loosely defining a third, not for PolitiFact purposes — that are working full time and are around the poverty rate. "
1865,"WASHINGTON — White House officials said on Thursday that President Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein will meet next week to discuss Mr. Rosenstein’s future at the Justice Department. The New York Times reported on Friday that Mr. Rosenstein had suggested secretly recording Mr. Trump to document the chaos of the White House in 2017 and had raised the issue of removing the president from office. That prompted Mr. Rosenstein to tell senior White House advisers over the weekend that he was willing to resign. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that was not his preferred outcome and that Mr. Rosenstein had denied the reports. “I’m talking to him. We’ve had a good talk,” Mr. Trump said. “He said he never said it. He said he doesn’t believe it. He said he has a lot of respect for me, and he was very nice, and we’ll see.” Initially, Mr. Trump had said that a face-to-face meeting would take place on Thursday, after he returned to the White House from three days in New York for meetings at the United Nations General Assembly. But later, he told reporters that he did not want a meeting to distract from a Capitol Hill hearing on allegations from a woman who accuses Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, of sexually assaulting her while they were in high school. In a statement, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said: “The president spoke with Rod Rosenstein a few minutes ago and they plan to meet next week. They do not want to do anything to interfere with the hearing.” Mr. Rosenstein arrived at the White House on Thursday morning for a previously scheduled national security meeting. But even as he arrived, an aide to Mr. Trump hinted that the meeting could be rescheduled for another day. “He will come back here, and there’s a lot on his docket, including the meeting with the deputy attorney general,” Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, told “Fox & Friends” on Thursday morning, a few hours before the Senate Judiciary Committee began hearing testimony from Judge Kavanaugh’s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, with Judge Kavanaugh to follow. “If it needs to get pushed a few hours or to the next day, maybe it will,” Ms. Conway said of the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Rosenstein. “But they are both committed to speaking with each other and resolving this once and for all.” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he was eager to hear what Dr. Blasey had to say during her testimony. He also said he would consider delaying his meeting with Mr. Rosenstein to focus on Judge Kavanaugh’s proceedings. “I want to watch. I want to see. I hope I can watch,” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday. “I’m meeting with a lot of countries tomorrow, but I will certainly, in some form, be able to watch.” "
1866,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The polls over the last few weeks have been quite bad for Republicans. FiveThirtyEight now gives the Democrats roughly an 80 percent chance to take the House and a 30 percent chance to take the Senate. (Public-service reminder: 80 percent is very different from 100 percent, and 30 percent is very different from zero.) There are many reasons that the polls are looking even better for Democrats, starting with President Trump. But it’s important to remember that most voters are not following the day-to-day twists involving the Kavanaugh nomination, Rod Rosenstein or any number of other big news stories. And most congressional candidates are not running campaigns about those stories. Democratic candidates are instead emphasizing pocketbook issues — especially health care. Lately, there are signs that the emphasis on health care is hurting Republicans. The biggest is that Republican candidates feel the need to talk about health care policy — and they’re doing so in a decidedly dishonest way. Take Josh Hawley, Missouri’s Republican attorney general, who is running against Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat. This week, he released an ad in which he claimed “I support forcing insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions.” "
1867,"Mr. Trump said he was accused of sexual misconduct by four or five women “who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me,"" and whom he claimed he had never met. He then contradicted himself and said that he “knew them a long time ago. Fifteen years ago, 20 years ago.” More than a dozen women have accused him of sexual misconduct. Of those women, he has met at least six, as The New York Times reported last year: A sixth woman, the makeup artist Jill Harth, said Mr. Trump groped her in 1992 and she filed a lawsuit against him in 1997. She later withdrew that complaint as part of a settlement of a different lawsuit with Mr. Trump. The president’s contention that the women were paid to falsely accuse him of sexual misconduct distorts news reports about financial donations to some accusers. The Times’s Kenneth Vogel reported in December that political partisans raised money to support accusers who came forward with charges of sexual misconduct about Mr. Trump and members of Congress. Gloria Allred, a high-profile women’s rights attorney, raised money to support Ms. Zervos’s legal fees in her case against Mr. Trump — not to pay her to make false accusations. Lisa Bloom, Ms. Allred’s daughter and another prominent lawyer, also sought donations to fund security and relocation for women who were contemplating sharing their stories about Mr. Trump, though some of them ultimately decided not to come forward. Ms. Bloom did provide financial aid for Ms. Harth, who maintained that her allegations were not affected by the payments, according to The Hill. "
1868,"Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his Palestinian counterpart, President Mahmoud Abbas, both spoke in front of world leaders on Thursday, offering diametrically opposing views on the causes of the protracted Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Their speeches come a day after President Trump said he hoped to announce the framework for a peace deal in the coming months. Earlier this week, Mr. Trump largely overshadowed the other heads of state who gathered for the 73rd assembly, first drawing laughter from a roomful of foreign leaders and then surprising many when he accused China of interfering in the midterm elections. President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority assailed the Trump administration on Thursday over pro-Israel decisions that he said “completely contradict” America’s role as a mediator. Mr. Abbas exhorted President Trump to rescind the decisions, which moved the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, defunded Palestinian aid, challenged the status of Palestinian refugees and countenanced Israeli settlement expansion. "
1869,"TOKYO — When Japan agreed to enter into bilateral trade talks with the United States during meetings at the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, the country’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, appeared to have finally said “yes” after two years of saying “no.” Japan has consistently insisted it was not interested in entering into bilateral trade negotiations with the United States. Instead, it has repeatedly invited the United States to re-enter a broad trade pact among 11 countries from which President Trump withdrew during his first week in office. Japan appeared at first blush to have acquiesced to American pressure and the threat of tariffs on imported cars by agreeing to start two-way negotiations to “promote Japan-U.S. trade.” Japan was “chased into a corner,” wrote Taketsugu Sato, national security correspondent for The Asahi Shimbun, a left-leaning Japanese newspaper. The Nikkan Gendai, a daily tabloid, went further, calling Mr. Abe a “traitor.” Yet by agreeing to open the talks, Japan received a reprieve from the looming auto tariffs as long as the talks continue. And American officials also accepted Japan’s insistence that it would not go any further than its previous commitments in the multilateral trade deal — known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership — to open up its markets for agricultural and forestry imports from the United States. Some analysts suggested Japan had effectively performed a bit of diplomatic jiu-jitsu, giving the appearance of compromising while wrangling concessions from the United States. "
1870,"Good Thursday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.) Selling your start-up to Facebook will make you rich, but it might not make you happy. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, who sold Instagram to the social networking giant for about $715 million, resigned earlier this week, reportedly over tensions with Mark Zuckerberg about growth. Brian Acton, one of the co-founders who sold WhatsApp to Facebook for $22 billion, went further. In a dishy interview with Forbes, he spoke of similar tensions with Mr. Zuckerberg. (Facebook wanted ads; he didn’t.) “They are businesspeople, they are good businesspeople,” Mr. Acton said. “They just represent a set of business practices, principles and ethics, and policies that I don’t necessarily agree with.” A senior Facebook executive, David Marcus, pushed back against Mr. Acton, writing in a post that “attacking the people and company that made you a billionaire” is “a whole new standard of low-class.” Yes, founders take their money and make a choice. But Facebook’s acquisition strategy appears to be stuttering, and its newer products may head in unexpected directions with their founders out of the picture. That’s a problem: Facebook’s acquisitions have been oases of calm and growth compared to its main business. "
1871,"PARIS — The French, it seems, have soured on President Emmanuel Macron, the wunderkind who swept to power 16 months ago. His poll numbers have slumped as the gloss on the 40-year-old upstart has faded. The consensus is in: He’s aloof, Jupiter-like, tone-deaf, devoted to coddling the rich. What else is new? Turning on the incumbent at the Elysée Palace is a French habit, like impatience with fools. Both Macron’s predecessors, François Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy, had slumped in the polls by this stage of their presidencies, although neither as low as the 19 percent approval rating for Macron in one recent survey. Malaise and ennui are not French words for nothing. In a whirlwind of activity, Macron has taken aim at the protections and entitlements that have made it hard to hire and fire in France, and sometimes made not working (at least in the official economy) more rewarding than working. He has reformed a labyrinthine labor code, ended the special status of state railway workers, cut taxes and improved access to job training. He has called the French “resistant to change,” even “lazy.” As Bloomberg reported, the president told an unemployed gardener that he, Macron, could “cross the road and find you” a job immediately in a bar or restaurant. That’s taboo in the can’t-do country par excellence. Live well, live hidden, goes the old French saying. Financial success is always a little suspect. Money is like God: best not mentioned in public. “Pro-business” remains an insult. Macron, the young disrupter and ex-banker, has been challenging an old country to adjust its self-image, embrace risk over security. Many have tried to do that. Many have failed. So the domestic honeymoon is over, like the coziness with President Trump that could not stop Trump trashing international agreements dear to Macron (Iran, climate). The rekindled thrill at Macron’s Gaullist pomp has ceded to irritation at his airs. A scandal involving his security chief, Alexandre Benalla, who was caught on video beating up a protester, was handled badly enough to become an “affaire.” Macron can be peremptory when his convictions are challenged. The business of politics engages him less than the burdens of history. "

1873,"This summer, student debt reached a record $1.5 trillion in the United States. To put that in perspective, student loan borrowers in this country are carrying debt equal to Russia’s gross domestic product in 2017. Over half say it’s preventing them from saving for retirement or for an emergency; more than 10 percent of borrowers are in default because they can’t pay their minimum balance. This crisis exists in part because actions by the Trump administration and the student-loan servicing companies it employs have condemned many people who’ve sought an education to a lifetime of debt. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Eleven years ago, Congress created the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. In exchange for 10 years of service to America — in its public schools, military, Civil Service or nonprofit service organizations — and making payments for those 10 years, qualified borrowers could have their debt forgiven. This year, Republicans in Congress introduced a bill to eliminate the program. While that legislation lays dormant for now, there’s another hurdle for people working in public service: The student- loan servicing companies the Department of Education keeps on contract to administer the program are accused by borrowers of sabotaging loan forgiveness by providing false information, delaying the processing of qualifying payments, and failing to certify eligible public service jobs. New Department of Education data confirms that the program is not operating properly. As of June 30, only 96 out of the 28,000 who had applied for forgiveness since 2017 had actually had their student loans discharged. As the union representing 1.7 million professionals around the country, many who work in public service, the American Federation of Teachers is trying to help. We’ve hosted student debt clinics nationwide to help our members learn about their repayment options. Some borrowers aren’t aware of the government’s loan forgiveness program because, in many cases, the Department of Education and loan servicer fail to adequately inform them of it. Those who do know of it have told us of their difficulties in trying to meet its requirements. "
1874,"To the Editor: The Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct involving Judge Brett Kavanaugh was a sickening moment for the nation. Christine Blasey Ford came across as a credible witness. Judge Kavanaugh sounded defiant, arrogant and entitled, and his refusal to endorse an F.B.I. investigation into Dr. Blasey’s allegations raised more doubts, at least among many of us who are already opposed to his nomination. But with all that said, what’s most upsetting was how the hearing showcased our nation’s crippling irreconcilable differences and how it’s infected yet another component of democracy. The system from top to bottom is failing with this charade of a nomination process. There will be no consensus in the end, no matter how things turn out for Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. We will likely be even more divided as a nation than ever before, and for that fact alone, our collective hearts should be broken. Cody Lyon
Brooklyn To the Editor: President Trump was right. The Kavanaugh-Blasey hearing is a total con job. It has 100 percent convinced me that an F.B.I. investigation into Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations is required. The president’s and the Republicans’ failure to follow normal procedures in this case is a rush to judgment and has the potential to put a sexual predator on the Supreme Court. Stop the confirmation process now and investigate these allegations properly! Robert Tormey
Escondido, Calif. To the Editor: As a rape survivor, I was shaking in my chair as Christine Blasey Ford described her assault. Having to testify at my rape trial was the most difficult thing that I have ever done in my life. My testimony lasted an entire day. Reliving the assault in vivid detail in front of strangers caused me to shake uncontrollably. I literally could not hold onto a glass of water. My testimony was only in front of jurors, a judge, my sister and my mother. My father was unable to attend the trial as it was too difficult for him. "
1875,"As nominees to the Supreme Court, Judges Clarence Thomas and Brett M. Kavanaugh were both selected by Republican presidents to replace retiring justices. Both attended Yale Law School and were judges on the federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. And both were accused of sexual misconduct. Justice Thomas now sits on the bench while Judge Kavanaugh’s fate, nearly 27 years later, is yet to be decided. On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee convened to hear allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford against Judge Kavanaugh, dating back to when they were both teenagers. Two other women, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick, have also publicly accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct but were not scheduled to testify in front of the committee. The following is a comparison of events leading up to Thursday’s hearing and the hearings in 1991. [For more coverage of Thursday’s emotional testimonies, read here.] ""He spoke about acts that he had seen in pornographic films involving such matters as women having sex with animals and films showing group sex or rape scenes. He talked about pornographic materials depicting individuals with large penises or large breasts involved in various sex acts. On several occasions, Thomas told me graphically of his own sexual prowess.” — Ms. Hill said in her testimony. "
1876,"We enjoyed reading student comments on all the newsworthy topics of the week — from sleep deprivation to football fandom, Instagram and going to college (with or without your parents in tow). But we were most struck by the seriousness and thoughtfulness with which students wrote about the biggest news of the week — the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh. Read on to find out their perspectives on this historic moment. And, this week, we welcome three new classes from Archmere Academy, Carol Stream, Ill., and Claymont, Del. Thanks for weighing in and keep up the great writing! Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. _________ The sexual assault allegations against Judge Kavanaugh dominated the headlines all week. As new evidence, additional accusations and opinions from both sides surfaced, we invited teenagers to weigh in with their thoughts and feelings. "
1877,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Gripping testimony in the U.S., the Indian Supreme Court’s adultery ruling, the Philippines president’s stunning admission. Here’s what you need to know: • American history in real time. In emotional testimony before a Senate panel, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford detailed the night she said the Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school. The hearing seemed at times to resemble a trial, with a prosecutor carefully questioning Dr. Blasey on behalf of Republican senators. Dr. Blasey remained steadfast, and insisted on her clarity of memory, and her sincerity. “I am a fiercely independent person, and I am no one’s pawn,” she said. Mr. Kavanaugh tearfully and angrily denied the allegations and accused Democrats of acting in bad faith: “You have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy.” Follow our live coverage here. And today’s word is “sequelae”: the harmful or unexpected aftereffects of a disease or trauma. Dr. Blasey used the word in her testimony to describe the lingering consequences of the alleged sexual assault. _____ "

1879,"Several flagship network shows return for their fall seasons. And stream the second season of the medieval sendup “Norsemen.” THE GOOD PLACE 8 p.m. on NBC. This critically beloved and constantly mutating sitcom returns for its third season on Thursday with yet another reset. Like “Lost,” “Community” and other brave shows before it, “The Good Place” will dive headlong into an alternative timeline, as the immortal architect Michael sends the show’s bumbling core quartet back in time to when they were still alive, in hopes they will atone for their sins. But Eleanor (Kristen Bell) and the others remain clueless, venomous and in sore need of some guidance. “The most refreshing thing about ‘The Good Place,’ in an era of artistic bleakness, is its optimism about human nature,” James Poniewozik wrote in his review in The New York Times in January. GREY’S ANATOMY 8 p.m. on ABC. As Shonda Rhimes moves on to new frontiers like Netflix and Broadway, her original breakthrough show continues to hold down a coveted prime-time network slot and captivate viewers in its 15th season. (Ms. Rhimes has passed on the reins of the show and now takes a hands-off approach.) This Seattle-based medical drama ended last season with Teddy’s (Kim Raver) pregnancy reveal. In this season’s premiere, Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) struggles to stay focused, while Jo (Camilla Luddington) and Alex (Justin Chambers) return from their honeymoon disappointed. MURPHY BROWN 9:30 p.m. on CBS. It’s been 20 years since Candice Bergen’s piercing gaze appeared on television in the role of the investigative journalist Murphy Brown. Ms. Bergen won five Emmys for the role and became the center of a culture war fueled by Vice President Dan Quayle. The rebooted version hopes to recapture that firebrand spirit, eyeing powerful figures, including the president. “The only thing I can thank him for is to have given us unplowed fields of material,” Ms. Bergen said of President Trump in an interview with The Times. In the first episode, Murphy returns to the airwaves on a new morning news program. NORSEMEN on Netflix. In December, Mike Hale, in The Times, named “Norseman” one of the 10 best international shows of 2017. This Norwegian comedy pokes fun at the current crop of extremely bloody and vaguely medieval shows — like “Game of Thrones” and “Vikings” — with gnarly, outlandish and hilarious scenes from an eighth-century village in flux. “There’s some Monty Python here and a lot of ‘The Office,’” Mr. Hale wrote. The second season is now available to stream. FREAKS AND GEEKS on Netflix. Binge on this groundbreaking dramedy before it leaves Netflix on Monday. Paul Feig and Judd Apatow’s high school show was a stamping ground for not only its caustic leads — like James Franco, Seth Rogen and Jason Segel — but also for other future stars. Look for Ben Foster, Lizzy Caplan, Steve Higgins and even Ann Dowd in bit roles. "
1880,"It takes Deborah Eisenberg about a year to write a short story. She works at a desk overlooking the gently curving stairwell in her spacious, light-soaked Chelsea apartment. A small painting of a brick wall, suspended from the high ceiling by two slender cables, hangs at eye level in front of the desk, a sardonic reminder of the nature of her task. For Eisenberg, coming up against a brick wall is what writing often feels like. At 72, she has been conducting her siege on the ineffable for more than four decades, and yet the creative process remains almost totally opaque to her. “You work and you work and you work and you work,” she told me recently, her delicate, quavering voice an audible testament to the endless hours of labor. “And for months or years on end, you’re just a total dray horse, and then you finally finish something, and the next day you look at it and you think, How did that get there? What is that? Why were those the things that I seemed to need to say?” Behind her desk is a wrought-iron daybed on which she takes frequent breaks to read; while she’s in the early stages of working on a new story, two hours of writing a day is usually as much as she can manage. When I asked her what she does with the rest of her time, a puzzled look came across her face, as though she were trying to decipher some hidden message in the ceiling moldings. “It’s hard to say,” she eventually conceded. For the past 40 years she has lived with the playwright and actor Wallace Shawn, whom Eisenberg refers to as “my boyfriend” and “my sweetheart.” (They have never married.) “I don’t like to cook, and I’m not a good cook, but I like to keep Wally fed,” she added. I waited a moment longer to see if she would say anything else. Then I changed the subject. In spite of her desultory M.O., Eisenberg has somehow managed to produce one of the most original and accomplished bodies of work in contemporary literature. With the exception of a play, a book about the painter Jennifer Bartlett and a handful of critical essays, her output consists entirely of short stories, and yet as a portraitist and interpreter of the moral and political chaos of American life she is the equal of any novelist of the past 30 years. Her stories rove from the Midwest, where she was born, to the metropolitan centers and foreign outposts of American power and concern the fate of artists and intellectuals, bankers, movie stars and C.I.A. apparatchiks, as well as drifters, dropouts and dead-enders, the politically displaced and the existentially homeless. Like their creator, her dramatis personae are beings of an almost extraterrestrial sensitivity and confusion; they look at the world with a kind of radical naïveté, as though they had never before encountered cars, buildings, trees or clouds, let alone the ambiguous workings of human social life. Just how strange it is to be that lost and lonely creature, oneself, is a realization that Eisenberg’s world-dazed men and women arrive at time and again. Naturally, Eisenberg is a master of the requisite short-story skill set: observation, pacing, surprise and economy. (Consider the hyperefficient characterization that occurs in these two short sentences: “Caroline had never cared what things were really like. He’d once heard her say thank you to a recorded message.”) At the same time, she has always been thrillingly heedless of the rules by which so many contemporary practitioners seem bound. “The confines of the short story never confine her,” Lorrie Moore told me in an email. Her work bristles with dreams, memory tangents, cognitive non sequiturs — the rough edges of life that most writers are eager to smooth away in their pursuit of formal elegance. “How else, except in the clarity of dreams, are you supposed to see the world all around you that’s hidden by the light of day?” one character asks, succinctly formulating one of the metaphysical paradoxes that underwrites all of Eisenberg’s work. In person, Eisenberg can also be hard to anticipate, her conversational manner shifting between assertive lucidity and groggy self-deprecation. “I go through my life in a fog, not understanding anything, so anything I tell you is questionable,” she warned me. Eisenberg and Shawn live in a narrow beige rowhouse with a black cornice and a lightly peeling facade, which give the place, its exorbitant property value notwithstanding, an air of mild bohemian dilapidation. From the roof deck, its potted hydrangeas and wisteria bursting with rude health, you can see the High Line, the disused stretch of elevated railroad spur that was converted into a public park in 2009. “It looks like a metaphor, like a morality play: all of humanity marching in one direction,” Eisenberg told me as we took in the view one sweltering July afternoon. She and Shawn sometimes walk there in the evenings. “The lighting is beautiful, the vegetation is beautiful,” Eisenberg continued. “People are lying around basically having sex — just doing whatever they want. It’s really nice.” With her intense pallor, hectic gray hair and deep-set brown eyes, Eisenberg looks a bit like a figure from a lost Tim Burton film. Each time we met, she wore black jeans and a black boat-neck shirt that hung loosely from her diminutive frame. She is slender, petite, brittle-looking; walking around Midtown with her a few days later, I kept worrying that she was about to be knocked over and trampled by the onrushing crowds. This feeling may have stemmed in part from an immersion in Eisenberg’s work, which is suffused with a sense of the brittleness, not just of bodies but also of communities and nations, even reality itself. In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, one character in “Twilight of the Superheroes,” the title story from her fourth collection, comes to think of reality as “a curtain painted with the map of the earth, its oceans and continents, with Lucien’s delightful city,” through which the planes tore a hole, exposing the dark world behind it. "
1881,"We don’t tend to talk much about undecided voters in political analysis. Sometimes, you can gloss over them altogether by referring to a candidate’s polling lead, such as “Dems plus-5.” But undecided voters can decide elections; in 2016 they played a key role in swinging toward Mr. Trump in the critical battleground states. This year, the battle for control of the House is more than close enough for a similar swing to flip the House either way. Over the last three weeks, we’ve interviewed more than 1,000 undecided voters in Upshot/Siena polls of competitive congressional races. The national political environment, which generally favors the Democrats this year, could prove to be a more important determinant of how undecided voters break or which undecided voters ultimately feel compelled to vote. But undecided voters differ from decided voters in important ways that could affect the final House map on Election Day. They might help the Democrats get over the top in Sun Belt districts where they’ve struggled somewhat in the polls so far. But they might help the Republicans a bit in the North, where many white working-class voters are still trying to make up their minds. In the aggregate, undecided voters don’t look very different from decided voters, either in terms of their attitudes or their demographic characteristics. They just aren’t as politically engaged. "
1882,"A New York Times article reporting that Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, had discussed invoking the 25th Amendment to remove President Trump from office and secretly recording him in the Oval Office led to a passionate discussion among our readers about how we handle stories that rely on anonymous sources. To offer more insight into how we work, we invited readers to send us their questions. Matt Purdy, our deputy managing editor, and Amy Fiscus, our national security editor, have responded to a selection, which have been edited and condensed for clarity. Would you ever decline to run a news story because you were concerned that running it would present too great a risk of a constitutional crisis? — Michael Kerr, Santa Monica, Calif. PURDY Our mission is to inform readers by publishing fair, factual and relevant news. On occasion, government officials — usually in intelligence or law enforcement agencies — ask us to withhold relevant news. We always listen to those requests, and there have been instances where we have delayed publication when they made a convincing argument that public disclosure poses a risk to life, by identifying an undercover intelligence operative, for example, or to a critical operation, such as the apprehension of a terrorist. The term constitutional crisis is used rather loosely, but if the question is whether we would withhold publication out of concern for the potential political or administrative ramifications — such as a presidential firing of a senior Justice Department official — the answer is no.

1883,"• Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, came out swinging in the early moments of his testimony to senators, saying, “This confirmation process has become a national disgrace.” • Christine Blasey Ford said she was “terrified” but delivered powerful testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee about her accusation that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her. • Immediately after the hearing adjourned, President Trump tweeted that “Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him.” • Senator Lindsey Graham exploded across the dais in an outburst unusual even for a highly partisan body. “What you want to do is destroy this guy’s life, hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020,” he said. • Republicans deferred their questioning time of Dr. Blasey to a veteran prosecutor, Rachel Mitchell. Democrats used their questions to make broad points about the integrity of Republicans’ investigation, the treatment of the victims of sexual violence in the United States and Dr. Blasey in particular.

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. With sexual misconduct accusations imperiling the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, various Republican lawmakers have pushed back hard. Some have suggested that they don’t want to let these allegations “destroy” or “ruin” his life. Samantha Bee rejected that argument on Wednesday. Expressing support for the accusers, Bee said she didn’t think being rejected from the nation’s highest court was the same as having one’s entire life destroyed. Bee pointed out that Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee reportedly sought to hasten the confirmation process when they found out that additional accusations were likely to surface. Bee was so upset by that news she wished a terrible fate on Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. Bee concluded the Kavanaugh section of “Full Frontal” by tracing what she said was a silver lining: She expects female candidates to do well in the midterm elections this November, something that could change the way business is conducted on Capitol Hill. President Trump has a new limousine with a broad array of security features. It cost the government $1.5 million. James Corden and Jimmy Fallon pounced on that news. "
1885,"Whether you believed her or not, whether she was assaulted or not, whether she was unambiguously offered the chance to testify in California or Washington or Timbuktu, Christine Blasey Ford made one thing painfully clear in her testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, and that was her genuine, almost desperate desire to please. It was heartbreaking to watch — as heartbreaking, in its way, as her testimony itself. There she was, recounting before a national audience her memory of being sexually assaulted in high school by President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, an experience that she said left her traumatized, shaken; some 30 years later she found it so unignorable that she was discussing it with a therapist. (It had rendered her sufficiently claustrophobic, she noted, to make her install a second front door to her home.) Yet her instinct, at every step of the way, was to be transparent, eager, almost agonizingly conciliatory. And it started almost the moment she began to speak. “I’ll lean forward,” she told Chuck Grassley, the committee’s chairman, when she discovered she couldn’t bring the microphone closer. “Is this good?” It was. “I will do my best to answer your questions,” she continued, “and would request some caffeine.” So began her testimony. She nodded a lot. She double- and triple-checked her documents to make sure she was on the same page, literally, as Rachel Mitchell, the prosecutor appointed by the Senate Republicans to cross-examine her. When Mitchell told her the committee had offered to interview her at her home, she seemed dismayed to have misunderstood. “I just appreciate that you did offer to do that,” Blasey said. “I wasn’t clear what the offer was. If you were going to come out to see me, I would have happily hosted you and had you!” I am not sure the Senate Republicans were quite prepared for how guileless Blasey was. Nor, do I suspect, was Mitchell, whose trap-laying style seemed designed for a witness everyone assumed would be far more canny or polished. (“I just realized I said something inaccurate,” was one of the phrases Blasey repeated over and over again, trying to help.) She was so without guile that she seemed to regard Mitchell as an ally, a means to tell her story, not even registering the prosecutor’s insinuation that her fear of flying was less than real. (“Correct, unfortunately,” she said, confirming that many of her hobbies and family obligations required taking airplanes.) "
1886,"Senator Lindsey Graham, the blunt-speaking South Carolina Republican, vented to reporters on Thursday outside the hearing room where the Senate Judiciary Committee was hearing explosive testimony about sexual assault allegations against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s embattled Supreme Court nominee. Then he went back inside and really let loose. “What you want to do is destroy this guy’s life, hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020,” Mr. Graham, red-faced and dropping all pretenses of legislative comity, yelled at his Democratic colleagues. “This is the most unethical sham since I’ve been in politics.” With those words, Mr. Graham all but cemented a slow-motion public political transformation over the past two years — from an anti-Trump, maverick Republican senator who often sought legislative compromise to Mr. Trump’s closest ally and most ardent defender. As one of Mr. Trump’s rivals for the presidency in 2016, Mr. Graham called him “the world’s biggest jackass,” a “race-baiting xenophobic religious bigot” and a “kook” unfit to be president. For his part, Mr. Trump responded by calling Mr. Graham “an idiot” and “not as bright, honestly, as Rick Perry.” But after Mr. Trump was inaugurated, Mr. Graham gradually changed his tune. He was spotted playing golf with Mr. Trump and chatting on the phone with the president. He has occasionally taken issue with Mr. Trump’s tweets, but has largely supported his agenda. For longtime observers of politics in Washington, it has been a remarkable change, underscored recently by the death of Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was Mr. Graham’s best friend in Washington and one of the president’s fiercest critics. "
1887,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Child poverty rises in Britain, Judge Brett Kavanaugh and an accuser prepare to testify and President Trump rails against China and Iran. Here’s the latest: • Britain is facing a child poverty crisis. In the past six years, the number of children living in poverty in Britain has jumped drastically. About a third of British minors will be poor by 2021, some forecasts say. Before the 2008 financial crisis, successive British governments had reduced by 800,000 the number of minors living in “relative poverty.” But much of that progress has been wiped out as the Conservative-led government has slashed welfare benefits, and no change to that is in sight. Conservative Party leaders dispute that its cuts are responsible, but the head teacher at Morecambe Bay Primary School, above, sees the impact firsthand on students. “It became clear that for many of them, it was caused by changes to the benefit system rolled out in recent years, which were forcing families into crisis,” she said. _____ "
1888,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel told the United Nations on Thursday that his intelligence agents had discovered a “secret atomic warehouse” in downtown Tehran, escalating a growing confrontation with Iran and setting up a direct challenge to its government to open the facility to inspectors and prove it is not in violation of the 2015 nuclear deal. Mr. Netanyahu’s claim, made at the same podium at the General Assembly where in past years he argued vociferously against signing the nuclear accord with Iran, came with photographs and map coordinates of the facility. He described it as a warehouse only three miles from the one that Israeli agents broke into last January, making off with 50,000 pages of  documents and computer discs full of atomic weapons, warhead designs and production plans. “Today, I am disclosing for the first time that Iran has another secret facility in Tehran,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “A secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and material from Iran’s secret nuclear weapons program.” Mr. Netanyahu did not describe what kind “equipment and material” was contained in the warehouse. Some types of equipment, especially if it was dismantled or could be put to a variety of industrial uses, may be permissible under the terms of the accord. Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman called the remarks “false, meaningless and unnecessary,” according to a Reuters translation of a Fars news agency report. Nonetheless, Mr. Netanyahu’s assertion poses a delicate political challenge for the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, whose inspectors frequently visit Iran’s declared nuclear facilities. The agency must now decide whether to demand access to the facility, based on the Israeli intelligence. "
1889,"A program intended to wipe away the student loans of qualifying public servants has rejected more than 99 percent of those who applied, according to a government audit that found that “fragmented” management and “piecemeal” operating instructions had contributed to the failure to forgive more debt. The Education Department said last week that 28,000 borrowers had submitted applications to have their debts canceled since the public service loan forgiveness program began accepting them a year ago. Only 96 were approved, the agency said. More than 70 percent were rejected for not meeting the eligibility requirements. Most of the rest had left necessary information out of their applications. In its report on Thursday, the Government Accountability Office said major administrative failings had left both the program’s administrator and borrowers in a state of confusion about the program’s rules. To get their remaining balances forgiven, applicants must spend at least a decade working for government agencies or certain types of nonprofit organizations; they also must make 120 qualifying monthly payments on their federal student loans. More than 1.2 million borrowers have sought to have their employment certified for eligibility in the program, the accountability office said. But the precise requirements of the program, which was created in 2007, are complex, and the Education Department has never given a written instruction manual to the company hired to manage the program, according to the audit report. That left the program’s administrator, the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, known as FedLoan, scrambling to figure out how to interpret policies and guidance that were often communicated to it haphazardly. In one case, Education Department staff emailed instructions to FedLoan that directly contradicted guidance given to the company by other agency officials, the report said. "
1890,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Political history unfolded in real time on television and computer screens across the country. Christine Blasey Ford, the first woman who accused Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, described the terror she felt more than 30 years ago, when, she said, Mr. Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, tried to rip her clothes off and clapped his hand over her mouth to muffle her cries for help. She remained steadfast in her account at a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying she was “100 percent” certain her assailant was Judge Kavanaugh, now a Supreme Court nominee. “I have been accused of acting out of partisan political motives,” she said. “Those who say that do not know me. I am a fiercely independent person, and I am no one’s pawn.” _____ 2. Taking the stand shortly after 3 p.m., Judge Brett Kavanaugh struck a markedly different tone. At turns indignant and emotional, he defiantly refuted the allegations, accusing Democrats of acting in bad faith: “You have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy.” "
1891,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration and Congress are on a collision course over the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement as the White House prepares to release text of a trade deal with Mexico that does not include Canada. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said on Thursday that while the administration still hopes to strike a deal with Canada, he is confident that lawmakers would greenlight a revised Nafta that includes only Mexico. “If for whatever reason we don’t reach an agreement with Canada, we’ll have an agreement with Mexico, a great agreement,” Mr. Mnuchin said at an event sponsored by the newspaper The Hill. “I’m confident that Congress will pass that.” Lawmakers, however, have expressed deep reservations about any deal that does not include Canada, suggesting it would not have the votes to pass. Mr. Mnuchin’s comments came a day after President Trump lashed out at Canada, saying it mistreated the United States on trade, and threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian automobiles if a deal is not reached. Mr. Trump, speaking at a news conference, claimed that he had rebuffed a request from the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, for a meeting and criticized Canada’s trade negotiator, Chrystia Freeland, the foreign affairs minister. “We don’t like their representative very much,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Mnuchin struck a more diplomatic tone, noting the importance of the trade relationship with Canada and expressing optimism that the few remaining “open items” could be settled. "

__________ Corporate America still has a long way to go to improve gender diversity. In March 2017, State Street Global Advisors, one of the largest fund companies, made a push to get companies to put more women on corporate boards. FactSet has now crunched the numbers to see if there has been an improvement since then. The answer: There’s a long way to go. The percentage of companies in the Russell 3000 stock index with no female board members declined to 18 percent from 23 percent. The percentage of companies in which women hold 15 percent of the board seats or fewer decreased to 47 percent from 58 percent. Currently, the boards of 22 companies have an equal split between men and women, while women make up the board majority at 14 companies, up from five. Just 5 percent of companies in the index are led by women, unchanged from March 2017. Buybacks may not be such a good thing for investors. A lot has been written about the surge in buybacks this year — they are up 50 percent from a year ago — but a question not often brought up is whether that has been a good thing for investors. Share repurchases have been a go-to move for companies to lift their stock prices over the past decade. But research from TrimTabs Asset Management is raising questions about whether the activity has done much to bolster stock prices. “Many of the companies that have bought their stock back have underperformed the market,” wrote Ted Theodore, chief investment officer at TrimTabs, and Vince Chen, a quantitative analyst at the firm. “And that is not just in the recent six months or so — for more than the last three years, an index focused on companies with a strong history of buying back their own stock has underperformed. President Trump’s tariffs are affecting trade, but not in the way he wants. The president has made reducing America’s trade deficit a cornerstone of his administration. The White House credited those policies with narrowing the deficit during the second quarter, but that narrative is now unraveling, wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. The United States’ trade deficit in goods widened last month to a six-month high. A slide in exports was the main culprit; they have now declined by more than 1 percent for three straight months. “Now, the data capture the simple point that the U.S. economy’s supply-side does not have the slack needed to meet domestic demand pumped up by the tax cuts and government spending increases. The deficit has further to rise,” Mr. Shepherdson wrote. "
1893,"A GoFundMe campaign set up on behalf of Christine Blasey Ford drew more than $200,000 in donations in the hours immediately after she mentioned it during her testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, more money than it had gained in the past eight days. As of 5 p.m., the campaign “Help Christine Blasey Ford,” one of at least two set up on her behalf, had raised more than $378,000 total — up from $175,000 when the hearing began at 10 a.m., according to a spokeswoman for the crowdfunding website. The GoFundMe campaigns came up after Rachel Mitchell, a prosecutor who questioned Dr. Blasey on behalf of Republican members of the committee, asked who had paid for a polygraph examination Dr. Blasey took as part of her sexual assault accusation against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee. “I’m aware that there’s been several GoFundMe sites,” Dr. Blasey told Ms. Mitchell in response, adding that the money would be used for her family’s expenses as a result of her speaking out, including security protection, but that she did not yet know how to access or retrieve it. Dr. Blasey and her family, facing death threats, have moved out of their home and hired a security detail since she went public with her allegation against Judge Kavanaugh. Dr. Blasey’s lawyers, Michael R. Bromwich and Debra Katz, interjected to say that her legal team had paid for the polygraph — “as is routine,” Mr. Bromwich said — and that they were both working pro bono. “We are not being paid,” he said, “and we have no expectations of being paid.” A spokeswoman for GoFundMe, Katherine Cichy, said the company had verified the authenticity of the “Help Christine Blasey Ford” campaign and one other, which ran from Sept. 18 to Sept. 20 and raised $209,987 explicitly for her security costs. It was shut down after it exceeded its $175,000 goal. “We are working directly with all campaign organizers and guarantee the funds raised will be transferred directly to the Ford family,” she said. (Dr. Blasey is sometimes referred to by her married name, Ford.) Ms. Cichy said Dr. Blasey’s family had been designated as the beneficiary of both campaigns, and that the funds could not be withdrawn by or redirected to anyone else. The organizers, with GoFundMe’s help, will coordinate with Dr. Blasey’s family to transfer the funds, she said. "
1894,"The Senate testimony of Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh unspooled over nearly nine hours on Thursday — about the length of a prestige mini-series, binged Netflix-style in one wrenching, riveting sitting. The mini-series contained multitudes. It was a political drama that doubled as a reality show. It was an interrogation of gender, class and power in #MeToo America. It was a duel of clashing narrators. And it had elements of a major sports broadcast, a showdown between rival squads complete with halftime commentary. As much as the proceedings reflected a nation bitterly divided — “This is hell,” Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, declared around hour seven — it also produced a rare collective civic moment. Every major broadcast and cable network suspended regular programming to carry gavel-to-gavel coverage. Americans gathered with friends and co-workers to watch. Twitter filled up with photos of airplane cabins, seat-back screens aglow with Dr. Blasey’s visage. Digital outlets, like streaming video, make it harder to capture the size of an audience. But network executives expected Thursday’s viewership to rival the 30 million people who tuned in for another generation-defining TV event: the testimony of the Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill in 1991. Unlike that hearing, Thursday’s drama on Capitol Hill was subject to instant analysis, dissected and framed in real time on social media. Judge Kavanaugh’s chances of confirmation seemed to fall and rise depending on the hour, as political reporters relayed tidbits from President Trump’s inner circle. Brit Hume, the veteran Fox News anchor, compared the feeling to election night of 2016, a yo-yo of emotions for partisans on both sides. At its core was a story born of literature: two protagonists revisiting a fateful moment from decades ago. “I am terrified,” Dr. Blasey said at the start of her testimony; they were virtually the first words that the public had ever heard her say.

The Revolutionary Power of Women’s Anger

The Power of Women’s Anger
By Soraya Chemaly
392 pp. Atria. $27. Revolutionary power is ascribed to many cultural and commercial products, but the journalist Rebecca Traister means the subtitle of her book “Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women’s Anger” in the old-fashioned sense: “This is about the specific nexus of women’s anger and American politics, about how the particular dissatisfactions and resentments of America’s women have often ignited movements for social change and progress.” In her rousing look at the political uses of this supposedly unfeminine emotion, Traister, a columnist for New York magazine and the author of two previous books on women and politics, cites the 18th-century slave Elizabeth Freeman, whose suit for freedom in the Massachusetts courts — based on the rhetoric of inalienable rights that she overheard being discussed by her owners — led to that state’s outlawing of slavery; the girls working the Lowell mills, whose organized walkouts would inspire a larger labor movement; Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton; Frances Willard and Carrie Nation; Rosa Parks, Fannie Lou Hamer, Florynce Kennedy, Gloria Steinem and Andrea Dworkin, as well as many less famous women who were part of the abolition, suffrage, temperance, labor, civil rights and feminist movements. What they all have in common is that at some point they found they could no longer tolerate the conditions under which they lived. In other words, they got mad. [ Rebecca Traister talked to The Times about women’s anger. Read the interview here. ] Though their efforts obviously involved much more than feeling angry, Traister spotlights the one emotion that, she contends, often gets underplayed in public discussions of history’s female activists, including the ones we now hold up as heroes. Anger, she writes, “has rarely been acknowledged as righteous and patriotic when it has originated with women, though women have often taken pains to mimic or reference the language and sentiments of America’s founding while making their own angry demands for liberty, independence and equality.” “Anger” can mean several different things for the purposes of the book: It’s a spontaneous emotional response to mistreatment, a motivating force for political action, an affect for which women are disproportionately criticized and penalized and an important aspect of public political expression that can be deployed in various ways. Indeed, a clearer taxonomy might have been helpful, given that Carrie Nation’s hatchet-swinging attacks on saloons during the temperance movement are a different kind of angry expression from Rosa Parks’s steady refusal to leave her seat, and both are different still from the teenage girl who survived the Parkland shooting and tweeted “I don’t want your condolences you [expletive] [expletive],” in response to Trump. The movement Traister spends most of the book analyzing is the one currently unfolding, the wave of female-led, progressive activism that began with Black Lives Matter, swelled after Trump’s election and produced a major shift in the cultural consensus on sexual harassment through #MeToo. Traister analyzes media coverage of the election and the women’s marches. She interviews Second Wave leaders, current politicians and activists, and a group of liberal suburban women who’ve just started pounding the pavement in Southern red states. She reviews the increased interest in feminism over the last 10 years, and describes a professional world in which, until 2016, women quietly hoped to overturn stereotypes and beat sexism by working hard and being charming (she counts herself among them). For such women — decently compensated, largely white and benefiting in many respects from the status quo — the election of Trump was a moment of bitter disillusionment leading perhaps to the first display of raw fury and political activism of their lives. For many women of color, and for many women who are immigrants, or poor, Trump’s victory was both more directly threatening and less surprising. “Among African-American women, there’s been a long consistency of action,” the Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams tells Traister. “What you’re seeing in the suburbs is now a version of that.” The various coalitions that have formed since the election have occasionally been fractious, but even more so they have been energized and highly effective in organizing and turning out the vote for a historically high number of female Democratic Party candidates. The unprecedented, if cautious, sense of solidarity among women (long an elusive ideal in a population sharply divided by class and race) is almost as important a theme in the book as anger itself. "
1896,"Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, was accused by federal regulators on Thursday of misleading investors with false public statements, a move that could force him out of the company’s leadership. At issue is Mr. Musk’s declaration on Twitter last month that he had “funding secured” to buy out the stock of the electric-car maker. The prospect created a firestorm on social media and in the markets that sent Tesla’s shares soaring. In a lawsuit filed in federal court in New York, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Mr. Musk of committing fraud by making false public statements with the potential to hurt investors. The suit seeks to bar Mr. Musk, who is also Tesla’s chairman, from serving as an executive or director of publicly traded companies like Tesla. Such a punishment is one of the most serious remedies the S.E.C. can impose against a corporate executive. The case is likely to send shock waves across corporate America and could lead to a re-evaluation of how companies use Twitter to communicate with the investing public. The S.E.C. said Mr. Musk “knew or was reckless in not knowing” that his statements were false or misleading. “In truth and in fact, Musk had not even discussed, much less confirmed, key deal terms, including price, with any potential funding source,” the S.E.C. said in its lawsuit. "
1897,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] It was a hearing designed for Republicans to win. There would be just two witnesses: Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford. Judge Kavanaugh would speak second, leaving the last impression. And there would be an outside prosecutor, Rachel Mitchell, to question Dr. Blasey for the male Republican senators. Their maneuvers may be their undoing. The hearing was an explosive collision between #MeToo — the cultural movement shaking the country — and the politics of outrage that drive President Trump’s Republican Party. Dr. Blasey’s memory was, at times, hazy, but her testimony was searing. She painted an unforgettable image of her attackers laughing as they pinned her to the bed and attempted to remove her clothes. “Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter. The uproarious laughter between the two, and their having fun at my expense,” Dr. Blasey said, referring to Judge Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge, who she says was in the room. When Judge Kavanaugh took the stand, he was furious and emotional. He lashed out at the Senate, blamed his situation on a desire for “revenge on behalf of the Clintons,” described his love for beer and cried when he described the prayers of his 10-year-old daughter. "
1898,"To the Editor: Re “President Taunts Kavanaugh’s Accuser at Rally” (news article, Oct. 3): That our president delights in mocking people is nothing new. Mortifying, embarrassing, cringe-worthy, but nothing new or surprising. What is surprising and really disheartening is the laughter and encouragement from the crowd, even from the women. Is this just a select group of Trump die-hards, or do we have in this country a significant percentage of the population that also relishes this sort of cruelty? If so, this is not the country I thought I was living in for the last 80 years. O tempora, O mores! John T. Dillon
West Caldwell, N.J. "
1899,"Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said Wednesday that he believed the Supreme Court was headed for a legitimacy crisis after Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh accused Democrats at a hearing last week of seeking revenge on behalf of the Clintons and of animus toward President Trump. In an interview with Alexander Burns of The New York Times, Mr. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said Judge Kavanaugh had exposed himself as a “right-wing Republican” who “thinks the Democrats are against him.” “He basically told you he’s going to join the four other Republicans on the court,” said Mr. Sanders, 77. If Judge Kavanaugh gets seated, Mr. Sanders added, the Republicans will have a five-to-four majority on the court, “and I expect that they will stand together working with big-money interests.” Mr. Sanders spoke candidly about that concern and others in a wide-ranging interview at the University of Maryland, where he also repeatedly urged college students in the audience (and watching on live streams) to register and vote in the midterms. The conversation was part a series called Get With The Times, which aims to inspire students to become involved in issues that matter to them. “The times are too dangerous for you to sit it out,” Mr. Sanders said. “You’ve got to get involved, and you have to participate in any and every way you possibly can.” Watch the full conversation here. Here are some other takeaways. "
1900,"Ah, yes, the Great American Bar Fight. Peanuts flying through the air, rivers of spilled Bud flowing down the bar top. A sacrosanct tradition that turns boys into men. Or, as others would put it, a clownish display of toxic masculinity that results in unnecessary injury and ruins everyone’s night. After news broke that Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court, was questioned in 1985 by the police after being involved in a bar fight, Twitter erupted in a debate over whether the behavior was a masculine rite of passage or a red flag for someone seeking a spot on the country’s highest court. According to a police report, Judge Kavanaugh, then an undergraduate at Yale, was accused of throwing ice at another man “for some unknown reason” at a bar in New Haven. Chad Ludington, one of Judge Kavanaugh’s college classmates, said in a statement on Sunday that the altercation had occurred after a UB40 concert, when he and a group of people went to a bar called Demery’s and were drinking pints. The brawl began when the group was staring at a man they thought resembled the lead singer of UB40, irritating him. The F.B.I. is currently investigating accusations of sexual misconduct against Judge Kavanaugh and related questions about his drinking habits that arose during the Senate Judiciary Committee’s confirmation process. [Struggling to keep up with everything on Judge Kavanaugh and the F.B.I. investigation into allegations against him? Catch up on the news] "
1901,"Congress approved legislation on Wednesday that reauthorizes the Federal Aviation Administration for five years. The legislation bars in-flight cellphone calls as well as the forcible removal of passengers. But perhaps more important is what is not in the bill. There are no new rules on airlines’ fees for reservation changes or bags and there is no move to privatize air traffic control. Part of the bill requires the F.A.A. to determine within a year the minimum distance between seats by studying how quickly people can safely evacuate different airplane configurations. Most airlines in the United States currently put 30 inches of space between rows in economy class, though some no-frills airlines like Spirit put only 28 inches between seats. “If they come up with a minimum seat regulation, that minimum will mirror the minimum in the market today,” said Samuel Engel, the senior vice president for aviation at the consulting group ICF. “So it won’t make things better.” The legislation was already approved by the House last month, and the Senate passed it on Wednesday by a vote of 93 to 6. The F.A.A. has been operating without long-term authorization since 2017. Congress has granted a series of temporary extensions for the last year. “A real five-year bill is vastly, vastly more stable than a series of extensions,” Mr. Engel said. “It removes quite a bit of uncertainty about the shape of the law for the next five years.” He added, “As long as you’re in that series of extensions, important projects get put on hold.” "
1902,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. China’s high-profile crackdown, Australia’s cancer victory, Priyanka Chopra’s latest venture. Here’s what you need to know: • Fan Bingbing becomes the face of a crackdown. She is China’s most famous actress, with roles in “X-Men” and “Iron Man” and branding deals with Louis Vuitton and Mont Blanc. Her months-long disappearance from public view was breathlessly reported, as were rumours of a government investigation. So when authorities accused her of dodging taxes and fined her nearly $70 million on Wednesday, they also sent a broader signal. The government is stepping up enforcement of tax evasion, which is rampant in China and an increasingly urgent problem in a slowing economy. The investigation also reflects China’s sensitivity to the influence its stars’ behavior can have — for better or worse — on public opinion. In June, authorities enforced a cap on salaries of actors, criticizing the film industry for “distorting social values.” _____ "
1903,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Took Part in Suspect Schemes to Evade Tax Bills” (front page, Oct. 3): Thanks to The Times for its excellent reporting on the real sources and scale of President Trump’s inherited wealth, plus its insightful editorial (“Donald Trump and the Self-Made Sham”). Mr. Trump’s lawyer provided The Times with “a written statement denying any wrongdoing and asserting that, in fact, Mr. Trump had little to do with the dizzying transactions involving his family wealth.” So which is it? Did Mr. Trump participate in corrupt transactions, likely making him dishonest as well as a con man, or did he have nothing to do with his family’s complex financial transactions that were the foundation of his wealth, which suggests incompetence? Either way he’s not the savvy self-made tycoon he’s constantly boasting he is. James Berkman
Boston To the Editor: Assuming that everything in this article is completely accurate, it is still very unfair. As you point out, the line between avoidance and evasion is murky and different lawyers will draw it in different places. But anyone seeking to legally avoid taxes will hire experienced lawyers to navigate the incredibly complex tax code. The Trump family, like many other wealthy families, had every right to do everything they could to avoid taxation in a legal manner. Apparently, they did not move money offshore to a tax haven, which is a common avoidance method. Significantly missing from this detailed analysis are the names of the tax lawyers who created the strategies and entities involved. That disclosure would be most telling. The leading tax strategy firms have many wealthy clients. If the Trumps were represented by one of those firms, they engaged in techniques employed by many others. On the other hand, if the Trumps were represented by a nonestablishment firm that engaged in activity that other lawyers would avoid, that is significant. "
1904,"HONG KONG — The comments were couched in careful language, but the warning about China’s direction was clear. China grew to prosperity in part by embracing market forces, said Wu Jinglian, the 88-year-old dean of pro-market Chinese economists, at a forum last month. Then he turned to the top politician in the room, Liu He, China’s economic czar, and said “unharmonious voices” were now condemning private enterprise. “The phenomenon,” Mr. Wu said, “is worth noting.” Mr. Wu gave rare official voice to a growing worry among Chinese entrepreneurs, economists and even some government officials: China may be stepping back from the free-market, pro-business policies that transformed it into the world’s No. 2 economy. For 40 years, China has swung between authoritarian Communist control and a freewheeling capitalism where almost anything could happen — and some see the pendulum swinging back toward the government. State-controlled companies increasingly account for growth in industrial production and profits, areas where private businesses once led. China has stepped up regulation of online commerce, real estate and video games. Companies could face higher taxes and employee benefit costs. Some intellectuals are calling for private enterprises to be abolished entirely. Dissenters in China these days must walk a careful line. But a sense of urgency — fueled in part by China’s slowing growth and rising pressures from President Trump’s trade war — has driven a growing number of officials and economists to speak out on the government’s changing stance on private business. Private enterprises are plagued by concerns and “dissatisfaction,” said Ma Jiantang, the top party official at the Development Research Center, a high-level government think tank, at the same forum, according to a transcript. "
1905,"Of all human spaceflight, Apollo 8 may have best demonstrated NASA’s capacity to change human perspective. In reflecting upon that mission, the first circumnavigation of the moon, the astronaut Bill Anders, one of three on board, said, “We came all this way to explore the moon, and the most important thing is that we discovered the Earth.” Anders had taken the photograph that came to be known as “Earthrise,” the first image of the planet captured by a human from beyond Earth’s orbit. As his fellow crew member Jim Lovell would point out, “Suddenly, everybody could see the Earth as it truly is: a grand oasis in the vastness of space.” It may seem counterintuitive to think that space exploration, with all its attendant risk and glory, primarily sheds light on our own home planet. But it does. This week marks the 60th anniversary of NASA’s founding. For the past two years, we have been making a documentary about NASA, and that idea was pretty much echoed by all 45 of the astronauts, scientists, administrators and historians we interviewed. Very early on, NASA uncovered two important truths. First, that our planet was the only one in our solar system with an environment capable of supporting human life and, therefore, extraordinarily unique. And second, that earth’s environment was fundamentally fragile, protected by a thin iridescent layer of atmosphere and susceptible to damage at the hands of the planet’s inhabitants. This has become increasingly apparent as Earth warms from greenhouse gas emissions. NASA now finds itself in the odd position of monitoring a developing planetary crisis that President Trump himself has dismissed. Fortunately, efforts by his administration to cut four missions under the agency’s earth science program that monitor the planet were blocked by Congress this year. In his book “Broca’s Brain,” the astronomer Carl Sagan wrote, “By far the most exciting, satisfying and exhilarating time to be alive is the time in which we pass from ignorance to knowledge.” Over the past six decades, NASA has led us in that journey, changing not only our understanding of the universe but also of ourselves. "
1906,"Connie Chung, the longtime television news anchor, said on Wednesday that she was sexually assaulted about 50 years ago, lending yet another high-profile voice of support to Christine Blasey Ford. In an opinion piece in The Washington Post, written as a letter to Dr. Blasey, Ms. Chung said that she was in college when she was assaulted by the very physician who delivered her in 1946. “I, too, was sexually assaulted — not 36 years ago but about 50 years ago,” Ms. Chung, who has worked for all three major broadcast news networks, CNN and MSNBC, wrote. “I have kept my dirty little secret to myself. Silence for five decades.” In the piece, Ms. Chung said that she was still a virgin at the time and had visited the doctor, whom she did not name, to inquire about contraception. He assaulted her during a gynecological examination, she said. In sharing her story, Ms. Chung joined a growing chorus of women to come forward with stories of assault since Dr. Blasey last month publicly accused Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, of assaulting her at a high school party decades ago. The women who have revealed stories of assault include Patti Davis, the author and daughter of President Ronald Reagan, and Padma Lakshmi, the television host and A.C.L.U. ambassador for immigration and women’s rights. "
1907,"To the Editor: Prof. Laurence H. Tribe’s Oct. 2 Op-Ed essay, “A Hamstrung Supreme Court?,” is spot on. A Supreme Court justice swears an oath to “faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me.” At his hearing, Judge Brett Kavanaugh testified under oath. Sadly, he made it clear he would not honor his obligations of impartiality and integrity. Though he has proclaimed himself as “independent,” his fierce, intemperate counterattack presented him as a man eager to retaliate against his perceived detractors. His scornful demeanor, his claim that he was a victim of “revenge” and his threatening reference that “what goes around comes around” combined to reveal Judge Kavanagh’s intent to serve as a political hatchet man bent on lashing out against perceived enemies for however long he serves. John P. Freeman
Seattle
The writer is professor emeritus of business and professional ethics at the University of South Carolina School of Law. To the Editor: Prof. Laurence H. Tribe’s recusal principles for Judge Brett Kavanaugh are like a restricted railroad ticket — good for this day and train only. Professor Tribe has refrained from applying his Kavanaugh principles to Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Her intemperate personal attacks on Donald Trump in 2016 when he was a presidential candidate should have disqualified her from participating in the many cases in which the Trump administration has been a party. Justice Ginsburg bemoaned in a 2016 interview with The Times: “I can’t imagine what this place would be — I can’t imagine what the country would be — with Donald Trump as our president.” Despite Justice Ginsburg’s scorn for Mr. Trump, she has participated in cases in which the Trump administration has been a party without dissent from Professor Tribe. Bruce Fein
Washington
The writer was associate deputy attorney general under President Reagan, 1981-83. To the Editor: Laurence H. Tribe makes a persuasive case for why Judge Brett Kavanaugh, if confirmed as a Supreme Court justice, would be ethically required to recuse himself from certain cases that might come before the court. However, there is no legal remedy — no appeal — if a justice decides not to recuse himself or herself. Thus if Justice Kavanaugh decides not to recuse himself when it would be appropriate to do so, the credibility of the Supreme Court will be severely damaged. Dorian Bowman
Cambridge, Mass. To the Editor: Laurence H. Tribe argues that Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s “intemperate personal attacks” and “partisan tirades” “disqualify him from participating in a wide range of cases that may come before the Supreme Court.” Doesn’t this imply that Judge Kavanaugh is also disqualified from participating in a wide range of cases in the appellate court on which he sits? Professor Tribe doesn’t say, though he writes that lower court judges have stricter recusal rules that “do not technically apply to Supreme Court justices.” Steve Wineberg

1908,"CAPE COAST, Ghana — With the unrelenting Ghanaian sun serving as her spotlight, Melania Trump has stepped out of her husband’s shadow, apparently showing the world what some 5,200 miles of breathing room away from her home city can do. On Wednesday morning, on the second day of a four-nation African tour, the first lady looked more comfortable striding into a meeting with local leaders on the coast of Ghana than she has perhaps ever looked in Washington. Given the bedlam of late in the American capital, that may be understandable. But as she makes her first big solo trip abroad, Mrs. Trump seems ready to show another side of herself: the happy one. Mrs. Trump has offered simple acts of grace on behalf of an administration with a fraught diplomatic history with Africa. She has spent much of her time just expressing appreciation to her hosts. “Thank you very much for having me,” she told the Ghanaian first lady, Rebecca Akufo-Addo, when the two met. “Thank you for having me,” she said to a small cluster of Ghanaians before entering a palace hall. “Thank you for your warm welcome,” she signed in the guest book of a stone fort through which thousands of enslaved people once passed. "
1909,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] The 2016 election was a perfect storm for conspiracy theories. On one side of the race there was a Republican nominee known for peddling conspiracies, most famously that President Barack Obama wasn’t born in the United States. On the other side was a Democrat whose family had spawned a cottage industry of sordid tales. I’m sure you remember the highlights: John F. Kennedy assassins, seizures covered up by the Secret Service, Manchurian candidates, child trafficking centers masquerading as D.C. pizza joints, etc. At one point, it felt like everyone involved in that election had gotten caught up in some kind of conspiracy theory. (Including me!) I was reminded of that craziness this week, after The Washington Times retracted and apologized for a column about Seth Rich, the Democratic National Committee staff member whose unsolved killing in 2016 sparked  conspiracy theories. Though the police believe Mr. Rich may have been killed in a botched robbery effort, many figures on the right — including Sean Hannity — have connected the death to the leak of D.N.C. emails. These days, removed from the din of a presidential election, it does seem as though we’re hearing less about those kinds of theories. But they certainly haven’t gone away (see: QAnon). "
1910,"On Wednesday we had a Presidential Alert test. Did you hear it? Your cellphone probably started beeping madly. It was just a run-through to make sure you’d get the warning if some terrible disaster was headed your way. You mean like Donald Trump? No, no, no. We’re talking about hurricanes. Or maybe missiles. The Presidential Alert means he’s warning you, not shooting at you. Are you sure? Because I was watching him at a couple of events over the last week and he seemed pretty darned … excitable. No, I swear this isn’t a problem. The president doesn’t really send the alerts. It’s the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA — is that the guy who was in danger of getting canned for misusing government cars? Well, a great number of major Trump administration officials would be in danger of being canned if the president were capable of cleaning house. Or even metaphorically sweeping the porch. But as we all learned long ago, the man who made his mark in the world by telling people “You’re fired!” on reality TV is incapable of actually firing anyone. Brock Long, the head of FEMA, has definitely been in trouble, since like virtually everybody in this administration he has a problem with using taxpayer dollars for his private transportation. But at least he never tried to use sirens to get through traffic at dinnertime, like the Environmental Protection Agency guy. "
1911,"Melania Trump, the first lady who is known to shy away from the spotlight, embarked on her first major solo international trip last week. While visiting Ghana, Malawi, Kenya and Egypt, Mrs. Trump wove in her child-focused “Be Best” campaign. She navigated a continent that has felt pressure from President Trump’s words and policies, from immigration to aid distribution. Mrs. Trump’s trip came at a chaotic time in Washington, as her husband faced a bitter fight over his Supreme Court nominee and partisan rancor weeks before the midterm elections. In front of the historic pyramids of Giza, Mrs. Trump answered questions from reporters in a rare five-minute session with the press. The first lady spoke about the Supreme Court confirmation of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, her husband’s late-night tweets and, of course, her wardrobe. “You know what?” Mrs. Trump responded. “We just completed an amazing trip. We went to Ghana. We went to Malawi. We went to Kenya. Now here we are in Egypt. I want to talk about my trip and not what I wear.” "
1912,"1. Isn’t an itsy-bitsy lie still a lie? Judge Kavanaugh, I don’t know what happened in 1982. But I’m deeply troubled by what I perceive as your lack of integrity last week. You told the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that your “have you boofed” yearbook question referred to farting, that “devil’s triangle” was a drinking game, that a “Renate alumnius” was simply a friend of Renate with no sexual insinuations, that the drinking age was 18. Really? As James Comey tweeted: “small lies matter, even about yearbooks.” No one sensible is going to hold teenage drinking against you, but we are bothered when you mislead senators and the public today and deny what is obvious: As you put it in 1983, “we’re loud, obnoxious drunks.” I appreciate that it’s embarrassing to be pressed to explain juvenile humor, but it takes only a moment online for anyone to see that “boofing” refers to anal sex or rectal infusions of alcohol or drugs, that a “devil’s triangle” is sex involving two men and a woman, that the drinking age in Maryland was raised to 21 when you were still 17. And the boast about being a “Renate alumnius”? Come on. We were all teenagers once. [Nicholas Kristof answered your questions about his column on Twitter.] What can we call these but lies? And they come on top of deeply misleading testimony about your knowledge of stolen documents when you were in the Bush White House and your involvement in judicial nominations then. As Republicans noted in the time of Bill Clinton's impeachment, lying under oath is still perjury when it is about sex or a salacious topic. So it seems to me that whether or not you broke any law 36 years ago, you broke it last week. 2. Do you have empathy for those who aren’t so blessed as yourself? An air of entitlement hangs over both your testimony and the sexual assaults, if they happened as alleged, and it leaves many of us with misgivings even as we acknowledge that you are a smart, hardworking and distinguished public servant. Presidential elections have consequences, and I don’t know that lack of empathy should be disqualifying. But here’s why it worries me. "
1913,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh had more uncertainty injected into it after President Trump mocked Christine Blasey Ford at a rally on Tuesday night. “I wish he hadn’t have done it, and I just say it’s kind of appalling,” said Senator Jeff Flake, above, one of three influential Republicans who could cast the deciding votes on the Supreme Court nomination. The others were critical as well. Senator Susan Collins told reporters the remarks about the woman who had accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexual assault were “just plain wrong.” And Senator Lisa Murkowski called them “wholly inappropriate and in my view unacceptable.” Other Senate Republicans continued to challenge the credibility of Dr. Blasey, confronting her with a sworn statement from a former boyfriend who questioned some of her testimony last week. With senators awaiting the results of the F.B.I.’s investigation, more than 650 law professors signed a joint letter directed at the Senate, asserting that Judge Kavanaugh is not suitable for Supreme Court. It was published by Times Opinion. "
1914,"The F.B.I. on Wednesday arrested a Navy veteran suspected of sending two envelopes to the Pentagon this week that contained raw materials for the deadly poison ricin. The man, William Clyde Allen III, was detained at a home in Logan, Utah. Two envelopes addressed to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and to the chief of the United States Navy, Adm. John Richardson, set off alarms in a mail screening facility outside the Pentagon on Monday. No one was injured. Defense officials had suspected that the letters contained ricin, but a Pentagon spokeswoman said on Wednesday that they actually contained castor beans, the raw material from which ricin is made. She said the F.B.I. was investigating. Another letter suspected of containing ricin was sent to President Trump at the White House on Monday, but was intercepted by the Secret Service. In a statement, the Secret Service said no one was injured. F.B.I. agents raided a single-family house in Logan, about 80 miles north of Salt Lake City, taking into custody a man described in local news reports as a Navy veteran. Agents closed down a block of North 200th Street, a quiet road with small homes and a large Mormon church. The F.B.I. did not respond to requests for comment, but told The Herald Journal of Logan that the house posed no risk to the public. Castor beans, used to make castor oil, pose little danger, but refined ricin, extracted from mashed castor beans, is so toxic that ingesting or inhaling a few grains can be fatal. During World War I, the United States investigated developing a chemical weapon using clouds of ricin dust. A Justice Department spokeswoman in Salt Lake City said federal prosecutors had authorized a probable-cause arrest for Mr. Allen, 39. Prosecutors have 48 hours to file charges. Mr. Allen served in the Navy from 1998 to 2002 as a low-ranking damage-control fireman apprentice on supply and support ships, Navy officials told Military Times. Nothing in his record indicates he served in combat. A Facebook account matching Mr. Allen’s name and location contained posts about Christianity and the golden ratio, but also a post suggesting he had watched online videos about extracting cyanide from apple seeds.

1915,"It is a scene that has become all too common, and dare I say dangerously close to becoming mundane: Donald Trump said something outrageous at one of his political rallies and his supporters, those hopelessly beguiled by the bully, cheered. This week, Trump trekked to Southaven, Miss., where he took the degenerate step of mocking Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault. Trump imitated and chided her: It was a repulsively grotesque spectacle, and yet from the assemblage of thousands came applause and roars of approval for Trump. It is at moments like these that I try to step back from the particulars, to create some distance, so that I can ask myself the larger, more profound questions. How did we as a country arrive at the point where this is even possible? And how are there so many Americans willing to accept Trump’s corrosion of our culture and our discourse, to gleefully follow him as he plumbs the depths, probing for a bottom of acceptability that, in his world, seems to have been obliterated? There are multiple explanations, to be sure: racism, xenophobia, ethnic hostility, Islamophobia, nationalism, Fox News, reduced access to privilege, lingering anti-Obama sentiments, a pronounced distrust of media in particular and truth writ large. But I believe there are two other explanations that are much more base: entertainment and ownership. "
1916,"David P. Schippers Jr., who served as chief investigative counsel for the House Judiciary Committee during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998, died on Friday at his home in Grayslake, Ill. He was 88. His son Judge Thomas Schippers said the cause was pancreatic cancer. Mr. Schippers, who had been both a federal prosecutor and a criminal defense lawyer, was a lifelong Democrat and well connected in Chicago political circles. He voted for Mr. Clinton in both the 1992 and 1996 presidential elections, his son said, and often told his children, “Never bet against God, Notre Dame or the Democratic Party.” But in 1998, when his friend Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican who was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, asked him to oversee the impeachment investigation, he accepted. “Dad did it because Hyde said he’d be good for the job,” Judge Schippers said. “He wanted someone who could be independent and who would not have some preconceived end in sight.” The committee’s task was to decide whether an explosive report by Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel, contained sufficient evidence to impeach Mr. Clinton. Mr. Starr’s team — which included Brett Kavanaugh, whom President Trump has nominated to the United States Supreme Court — recommended 11 grounds for impeachment, including that Mr. Clinton had lied under oath and obstructed justice to hide his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern. "
1917,"It may seem paradoxical that while the number of migrants arriving in Europe has fallen by 90 percent from its 2015 peak, the refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos has grown into an unspeakable hell, where asylum seekers are driven to madness and suicide. Sadly, the horror of Camp Moria described by Patrick Kingsley of The Times this week is the price of the actions that have stemmed the flow of refugees. When the flood of refugees was at its high point, Camp Moria was basically a way station, one of the first stops for asylum seekers, many fleeing war in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, on their way to the European mainland. But as the European Union has responded to the crisis by closing internal borders and cutting deals with Turkey and African governments and warlords to slow the exodus, many of the migrants have become stranded where they first make landfall. Though only about 23,000 refugees have reached the Greek islands this year, down from 850,000 in 2015, they must now wait at camps like Moria for as long as two years before they are either sent back or sent on. The squalor and dangers of the camp are unlikely to draw criticism from President Trump, whose cynical efforts to curb legal and illegal immigration were highlighted by the decision announced last month to reduce next year’s refugee resettlement quota to 30,000, the lowest ever. As recently as 2016, the United States admitted 85,000 refugees. Mr. Trump has also shown no scruples about his inhumane policy of separating families. Struggling to find room for 13,000 detained migrant children, whose numbers have increased more than fivefold since last year, the administration has roused hundreds of children in the middle of the night and bused them to a sprawling tent city in the West Texas desert. At Camp Moria in Greece, conditions are grim. Mr. Kingsley describes a camp built for 3,100 now overflowing with three times that many. There’s one cold shower for each 80 people, one foul toilet per 70; people stand in line all day for food and wait months for an interview; gangs prey on the weak; sexual assaults are common; and suicide attempts are constant. With no room for more refugees, the camp has overflowed into rough encampments beyond its fences. Greece has now begun moving some of the most vulnerable refugees to Athens, but that is not likely to make a big difference soon. "
1918,"ATLANTA — Seven law enforcement officers were shot — at least one of them fatally — in an extraordinary barrage of firepower after the authorities sought to serve a search warrant in South Carolina on Wednesday, officials said, transforming a residential subdivision into a tragic battleground. The episode, punctuated by evacuations in a tactical vehicle and a protracted standoff between a barricaded suspect and the authorities, was among the American police shootings with the greatest bloodshed in recent years. “They thought it was a random search warrant,” Sheriff Kenney Boone of Florence County, S.C., said at a news conference on Wednesday night, when he and other local officials appeared distraught. “But when they arrived, gunfire started.” Chief Allen Heidler of the Florence Police Department praised the deceased officer, Terrence Carraway, as “the bravest police officer that I have ever known.” Officer Carraway had been a member of the police force in Florence for more than 30 years, officials said. Although many details about the episode — including the reason for the warrant and the precise sequence of the fatal encounter — remained unclear on Thursday morning, the local authorities depicted an afternoon of chaos in the Vintage Place subdivision in Florence, a northeastern South Carolina city of about 37,000 people. "
1919,"WASHINGTON — Senator Mitch McConnell had just arrived at Reagan Washington National Airport on Monday afternoon to resume the battle over the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh when he was met by an unwelcoming committee — a group of women who angrily confronted him. “Do you always turn your back on women like this?” one demanded of Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, as his security detail cleared the way. “Especially women of color who are all sexual assault victims?” asked another. Mr. McConnell is not Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who was moved by similar protests to seek a new F.B.I. inquiry into claims of sexual assault against Judge Kavanaugh. Mr. McConnell, undeterred by his critics, instead stared straight ahead and marched through the concourse. And that is exactly how he is approaching the confirmation fight — marching straight ahead, unfazed by his opponents, toward his goal of seating Judge Kavanaugh on the court. “We will not be intimidated by these people,” Mr. McConnell declared Wednesday in another floor speech where his anger over the treatment of Judge Kavanaugh spilled out. “There is no chance in the world that they’re going to scare us out of doing our duty.” Underscoring his commitment, Mr. McConnell took the procedural steps later Wednesday to set up a key test vote on Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation for Friday. To Mr. McConnell, his nearly singular duty these days is filling federal court vacancies with conservatives, so with a second Supreme Court confirmation in less than two years in sight, he has a lot on the line. If he is successful, he will have secured a legacy of reshaping not just the lower courts, but the Supreme Court itself for years to come. "
1920,"Americans are forming seemingly irreconcilable camps around the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to a seat on the Supreme Court. Christine Blasey Ford, a California research psychologist, testified in searing detail before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers. Judge Kavanaugh angrily and emotionally denied her accusations, and President Trump, at a rally in Mississippi Tuesday evening, mocked Dr. Blasey for gaps in her memory of the episode. The nomination has become a touchstone of the #MeToo movement, a vivid reminder of the deep chasm between men’s and women’s lived experience of sex and power. Many opponents of Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation have taken to the streets to express their anger and solidarity, including, as shown, on Wednesday in Brooklyn. "
1921,"WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence will signal a far tougher American line on China on Thursday, delivering a speech in which he is expected to accuse the Chinese of aggressive moves against American warships, of predatory behavior against their neighbors, and of a sophisticated influence campaign to tilt the midterms and 2020 elections against President Trump. “To put it bluntly, President Trump’s leadership is working,” Mr. Pence is to say, according to excerpts from his speech provided on Wednesday night. “China wants a different American president.” Mr. Trump accused China last week of meddling  in the midterm elections, saying at the United Nations in New York that it was retaliating for his imposition of tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods. But the president was careful not to antagonize China’s president, Xi Jinping, with whom he has cultivated a personal relationship. Mr. Pence, however, will broaden the attack on China to encompass its rapid military buildup in its coastal waters; its use of debt financing to corrupt financially vulnerable countries; and its influence campaign in American news media, at think tanks and on college campuses, which he will claim is more extensive than that deployed by the Russians in 2016. “Beijing has mobilized covert actors, front groups and propaganda outlets to shift Americans’ perception of Chinese policies,” Mr. Pence is set to say. “As a senior career member of our intelligence community recently told me, what the Russians are doing pales in comparison to what China is doing across this country.” As ties between Washington and Beijing have frayed, administration officials have been airing these grievances privately for weeks. But Mr. Pence’s remarks, scheduled for 11 a.m. at the Hudson Institute in Washington, will be the first time a top American official has strung them together in a narrative of Chinese aggression, and delivered them so publicly. "
1922,"The federal official in charge of enforcing fair-lending laws that are intended to prevent discrimination is facing criticism for a series of racially provocative comments spanning the last 14 years. Eric Blankenstein, head of the supervision, enforcement and fair lending division at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a watchdog agency founded under President Barack Obama, apologized to agency staff members on Monday after a blog post using the N-word he wrote in 2004 as a University of Virginia law student became public. On Wednesday, Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee asked Mick Mulvaney, the bureau’s interim director, to explain the vetting procedures used to hire Mr. Blankenstein. Mr. Mulvaney recruited Mr. Blankenstein, a close ally, from a federal trade agency post in December, shortly after being appointed to run the C.F.P.B. “It is unclear whether his appointment is due to a failure to investigate Mr. Blankenstein’s background prior to his appointment, Mr. Blankenstein withholding information from you and the C.F.P.B., or an informed decision on your part to ignore his public comments,” wrote Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio and the committee’s ranking member. After bureau employees complained following publication of Mr. Blankenstein’s 2004 comments in The Washington Post, Mr. Blankenstein sent an email to agency staff members, saying that he “absolutely” regretted “some of the things I wrote when I was 25,” adding that “the tone and framing of my statements reflected poor judgment.” Mr. Mulvaney has so far been supportive of Mr. Blankenstein, who shares his belief that the bureau overstepped its authority by aggressively pursuing payday lenders and other financial services companies during the Obama administration. "
1923,"WASHINGTON — For more than two weeks he held back. Against all his instincts, President Trump for the most part resisted directly attacking the woman whose sexual assault allegation has jeopardized his Supreme Court nomination. The accuser was to be treated with kid gloves, like “a Fabergé egg,” as one adviser put it. But Mr. Trump could resist only so long and told aides it was time to turn up the heat. So when he revved up a political rally this week by mocking Christine Blasey Ford, he indulged his desire to fight back and galvanized his conservative base even at the risk of alienating the very moderate Republicans he needs to confirm Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. The president’s scathing and derisive impression of Dr. Blasey, who has accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers, came at the same time his Republican allies stepped up their efforts to challenge her veracity. Seizing on a sworn statement from a former boyfriend, Republicans suggested that she had not been fully truthful in her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week. The gloves-off approach could further complicate Mr. Trump’s efforts to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court by winning over three undecided Republican senators who have insisted that Dr. Blasey’s allegation be taken seriously, Susan Collins of Maine, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. The Senate will begin voting on Judge Kavanaugh on Friday and was expected to hold a final vote over the weekend. All three condemned the president’s rally riff on Wednesday, using phrases like “wholly inappropriate,” “kind of appalling” and “just plain wrong.” Even some of the president’s strongest supporters called his attack on Dr. Blasey counterproductive, including Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and Judge Kavanaugh’s most outspoken supporter, and the hosts of “Fox & Friends,” the president’s favorite morning television program.

1924,"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Hi, everybody! While the nation’s attention was riveted last week by a certain Supreme Court confirmation fight, the Trump administration quietly continued its efforts to roll back environmental regulations. Our colleague Coral Davenport reported that the Interior Department plans to loosen safety regulations for offshore drilling that were issued by the Obama administration after the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The administration is also getting rid of its Office of the Science Advisor — more evidence that the administration is marginalizing science as part of its decision making — and has placed the head of its Office of Children’s Health Protection on leave. The agency did not give a reason for the move. Outside of Washington, killer whales are turning up with toxic levels of PCBs in their blubber. Worldwide production of the compounds ended in 2001 under international agreements, but some problems, and chemicals, linger. But you knew we’d end up talking about those Supreme Court hearings, right? In case you missed it, our colleague Brad Plumer recently wrote about how, if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh might reshape environmental law. (He has tended to rule against sweeping environmental regulations.) It’s that time of year again: early fall, when sea ice in the Arctic has melted as much as it is going to melt. As has been the case in recent years, there’s a lot less ice than there used to be. "

Hello and welcome to your daily roundup of what’s going on in pop culture, I’m Eleanor, your guide and occasional interpreter.

1926,"For many of New York’s most progressive liberals, Cynthia Nixon was an enticing alternative to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democratic moderate for much of his two terms in office. Still, it was something of a risk for the Working Families Party to endorse Ms. Nixon over the governor, who has been known to hold a grudge. That risk became clear when Mr. Cuomo trounced Ms. Nixon in the Democratic primary last month, leaving the W.F.P. with a difficult choice: Keep Ms. Nixon, the actress and education advocate, atop its ticket in November, or ask Mr. Cuomo to take the party’s line. On Wednesday night, her truest supporters seemingly conceded to the inevitable, as the Working Families Party grudgingly opted to endorse Mr. Cuomo for re-election in November. The move potentially gives Mr. Cuomo, who is seeking a third term, a valuable perch from which to receive votes in the general election against the Republican candidate, Marcus Molinaro, and could help the W.F.P. assure its own survival as a viable third party in the state. Under state law, any party that fails to get 50,000 votes in an election for governor loses its place on the ballot until the next election for governor, effectively ending its influence in elections for four years.

1927,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. The origins of President Trump’s wealth, squalid conditions at a Greek refugee camp, an uncertain future at Marks & Spencer. Here’s the latest: • President Trump’s inherited fortune. “I built what I built myself,” Mr. Trump has often said. But a special Times investigation, based on a vast trove of confidential tax returns and financial records, has found that his fortune is deeply connected to the riches of his father, the New York City builder Fred Trump. Above, Mr. Trump in the Oval Office this fall, with portraits of his parents behind him. Much of the money he received — at least $413 million in today’s dollars — came from helping them dodge taxes by setting up sham corporations, filing improper deductions and even undervaluing real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars, records and interviews show. Some schemes were outright fraud. Here are 11 takeaways. A lawyer for Mr. Trump called the findings “100 percent false, and highly defamatory.” Read his full statement. _____ • “A mass burial every day.” Help and heavy equipment were on the way in Indonesia, where a powerful earthquake and devastating tsunami rocked the island of Sulawesi on Friday. But a spokesman for the country’s disaster management agency said time was running out to find anyone alive. "
1928,"For decades Republican leaders vowed to recruit more minority candidates and tried to project a “big tent” image for the party, and in recent years they saw some payoff with governors: Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Nikki Haley of South Carolina, both Indian-Americans who have since moved on, and Brian Sandoval of Nevada and Susana Martinez of New Mexico, both Hispanic-American. But in the first midterm elections under Donald J. Trump, whose campaign and presidency included strong appeals to white voters, Republicans have no black or Hispanic nominees for governor in 2018, and few from other racial minorities, in the 36 states holding elections for the position. The overwhelming majority are white men. And with Mr. Sandoval and Ms. Martinez leaving by early January, Republicans are at risk of having an all-white bench of governors in 2019. Democrats this year, by contrast, have nominated black, Hispanic and Native American candidates for governor in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Maryland and elsewhere. This lineup comes after years when Democrats were weak on diversity in governors’ races. The Republican falloff is striking after past election seasons when party leaders attempted to identify and then rally behind minority candidates for governor in major states, like Ohio and Pennsylvania. But several Republican leaders, pollsters and former candidates said they see the lack of diversity as a consequence of President Trump’s offensive language on race, from Mexicans and immigrants to black football players and the protest in Charlottesville, Va., arguing that some prospective minority candidates don’t want to defend Mr. Trump or be aligned with his party. Other Republicans say that an embrace of white identity has become integral to the party’s culture and voter base under Mr. Trump, so it is no surprise that white candidates ran and won in primaries dominated by white conservative voters.

Late-night hosts pounced on a New York Times report on Tuesday showing that President Trump relied on his father’s wealth to a much greater degree than he had disclosed. Fred Trump, the president’s father, transferred hundreds of millions of dollars to his son, often in order to avoid estate taxes, the report found. All the hosts seemed unsurprised to hear that. But most were impressed by how quickly a (very) young Trump had amassed his fortune. Stephen Colbert offered a variation on the theme. The Stormy Daniels story still won’t disappear. A small but possibly embarrassing new detail surfaced on Tuesday. "
1930,"“Americans will receive a text message this week as part of a Wireless Emergency Alert System test ... Cellphone users can opt out of natural disaster or missing children alerts, but will not be able to avoid the presidential alert system.” — The Independent PRESIDENT TRUMP: Hello, America, this is your all-time favorite president testing the wireless emergency alert system. FEMA: FEMA confirms that this text to all Americans is part of our emergency preparation. COAST GUARD: The Coast Guard is ready to provide full support in the event of an emergency. TINA WILLIAMS (Albany): What is this? I didn’t sign up to receive group texts from the government. JOSH COOK (Cleveland): I didn’t either. Please remove me. EVERYONE’S MOM: I don’t see the link you sent me. EVERYONE: There’s no link. It’s just a text sent by the president. DONALD TRUMP JR.: Love how the snowflakes are getting so “triggered” over these group texts when Obama signed the law allowing him to text the entire country all the time. 😭 "
1931,"Given the credible evidence of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, it’s only natural that Americans are concerned about the possibility of further foreign interference, especially as the midterms draw closer. But I worry that we’re focusing too much on the foreign part of the problem — in which social media accounts and pages controlled by overseas “troll factories” post false and divisive material — and not enough on how our own domestic political polarization feeds into the basic business model of companies like Facebook and YouTube. It’s this interaction — both aspects of which are homegrown — that fosters the dissemination of false and divisive material, and this will persist as a major problem even in the absence of concerted foreign efforts. Consider some telling exchanges from this year’s Senate hearings involving high-level executives from Facebook and Twitter. (Google, which owns YouTube, didn’t bother sending a comparable representative.) In April, Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, pressed Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, on how much money the company had made by ads placed by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll factory. Mr. Zuckerberg replied that it was about $100,000 — a negligible amount of money for the company. Last month, Ms. Harris further grilled Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, on this point, demanding to know how much inauthentic Russian content was on Facebook. Ms. Sandberg had her sound bite ready, saying that “any amount is too much,” but she ultimately threw out an estimate of .004 percent, another negligible amount. The exchange made for good viewing: a senator asking tough questions, chastised executives being forced to put exact numbers on the table. But the truth is that paid Russian content was almost certainly immaterial to Facebook’s revenue — and the .004 percent figure, though almost certainly rhetorical, does capture the relative insignificance of the paid Russian presence on Facebook. "
1932,"The Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh and the ensuing storm over the sexual assault allegations made against him have exposed many things, but perhaps most of all, they have exposed the depth, belligerence and intransigence of misogyny in our time. What we have been witnessing is the form misogyny takes when the most powerful, wealthy and entitled of white men find themselves confronted by women unwilling or unable to keep silent any longer. Donald Trump provided a typical example on Tuesday when he used his platform as president to openly mock Christine Blasey Ford and her testimony during a rally in Mississippi. The uproar over the Kavanaugh hearings — even more powerful than the one that followed the release of the “Access Hollywood” tape during the presidential campaign, on which Donald Trump boasted about committing sexual assault — has plunged the nation into a sort of civil war. As a philosopher, I am inclined to see this as a war between two epistemic worlds. By “epistemic world” I mean a broadly shared framework for knowing in which emotions, moral sensibilities and reason are all informed by certain values, either consciously or unconsciously held. These values are at stake in moments like this one, and so are the material power arrangements that support and give rise to them. When our epistemic world is threatened, we feel ourselves being undone. In the first world, privileged white men get to do with impunity what other men at least have to think twice about, and for women who dare to speak of them, the punishment is swift and devastating. Aggressive sexual behavior toward women, far from disqualifying a candidate for the highest offices in the land, demonstrates the kind of manhood that is felt to be a qualification for such positions (though no one with public power can say this out loud anymore — only “the base” can speak clearly). In the second epistemic world, the default position is to believe women who make sexual assault allegations, the good ol’ boys’ network seems ugly and out of date (#timesup), and too often moral outrage substitutes for real thinking, and more important, for real power. That photograph of the panel of 11 white men who represent the Republicans on the judiciary committee for Kavanaugh’s nomination provokes such unease in the second epistemic world, because it is the visual representation of the kind of institutionalized white male power that is supposed to be receding into the past. But make no mistake — the “old” world represented by that photograph is right here, right now, and despite the remarkable gains of the #MeToo movement, it controls every branch of our government. "
1933,"Good morning on this clearing Wednesday. Vulgar quotations have been written on sidewalks across our city and many others. A few of them: “Let me be your Harvey Weinstein.” “I can get you pregnant for $20.” “It’s not harassment since there’s nothing to grab.” Yes, they are tough to read. But that’s the point: The project, called “Catcalls of NYC,” by Sophie Sandberg, a senior at New York University, documents on Instagram what New Yorkers are hearing on our streets and where. Victims of street harassment send Instagram messages to Ms. Sandberg with the location of the catcalls and what was reportedly said, and she writes the comments at those same sites with brightly colored chalk. (She calls that “chalking back.”) After Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in response to Dr. Blasey’s sexual assault allegation against Judge Kavanaugh, Ms. Sandberg said she had been receiving up to 20 new messages a day, many of them about harassment in schools. (Before that, she would receive fewer than five.) “It’s been blowing up because what happened with Kavanaugh and Ford was back in high school, whether this is verbal harassment — boys making comments about girls’ bodies — or physical harassment,” said Ms. Sandberg, who has been adding the hashtag #stopharassmentinschools to catcalls submitted by students.

Here’s what you need to know: President Trump has long sold himself as a self-made billionaire, repeatedly saying, “I built what I built myself.” But in reviewing over 100,000 pages of records, an investigation by The New York Times found that Mr. Trump’s finances were deeply intertwined with, and dependent on, his father’s wealth. By age 3, Mr. Trump was earning $200,000 a year from his father’s empire. He was a millionaire by age 8. In all, Mr. Trump received at least $413 million in today’s dollars from his father’s real estate empire. What’s more, a large portion of that money came to Mr. Trump through the use of dubious tax schemes in the 1990s, including outright fraud.

1936,"Good Wednesday. Want this by email? Sign up here. The president claims that his company was built solely through hard work. A 14,000-word investigation by the NYT begs to differ. It found that the Trump Organization owes its success to multimillion-dollar gifts from Fred C. Trump, President Trump’s father, and tax schemes that some experts say may have broken the law. Highlights from the investigation: • His father’s housing empire started paying Mr. Trump during childhood — the equivalent of $200,000 a year in today’s money when he was three. • Mr. Trump has often said that his father lent him only $1 million. He received at least $60.7 million in loans, many never repaid. • Fred Trump grossly undervalued properties that he passed onto his children, dodging hundreds of millions in gift taxes. • The Trumps created a company that inflated the value of equipment purchased for their housing units and passed the difference onto the Trump children. One tax expert said that might have constituted criminal tax fraud. The statute of limitations has passed for potential criminal charges, but the Trump family could face civil fines. New York State’s tax regulator said it has opened an investigation. "
1937,"PARIS — In a rebuke to the Trump administration, the International Court of Justice ordered the United States on Wednesday to ease some sanctions against Iran, including those related to the supply of humanitarian goods and the safety of civil aviation. In response, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced in a news conference that the United States would cancel a treaty signed in 1955 by the two countries that had provided a basis for friendly diplomatic exchanges and economic relations, long before Iran’s Islamic revolution turned the two nations into enemies. The interim ruling by the United Nations’ highest court, also known as the World Court, came in response to an urgent plea from Tehran after President Trump’s announcement in May that he would withdraw from the 2015 international accord limiting Iran’s nuclear ambitions. His decision was followed by a first round of sanctions in August, and a second round is due in November. The court order, unanimously handed down by its 15 judges, amounts to an injunction while Iran’s July lawsuit challenging the sanctions winds its way through the court — a process that could take years. Iran, however, took the outcome as vindication. “The decision proved once again that the Islamic Republic is right and the U.S. sanctions against people and citizens of our country are illegal and cruel,” the Foreign Ministry in Tehran said, according to state media. During hearings in August, Iran argued that the United States was strangling the country “through naked economic aggression” and was violating the Treaty of Amity signed by the two countries on economic relations and consular rights in 1955, long before Iran’s Islamic revolution turned the them into enemies.

1938,"At 2:18 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday, cellphones across the United States emitted the ominous ring of an emergency presidential alert. It was the first nationwide test of a wireless emergency alert system, designed to warn people of a dire threat, like a terror attack, pandemic or natural disaster. “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System,” it read. “No action is needed.” Two minutes later, televisions and radios broadcast test alerts. There was no notification plan for landlines. The president — or someone he designates — would make the decision to send a real alert in case of a nationwide catastrophe, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency would push the button. There is no opting out, which drew complaints on social media — and had already prompted a lawsuit. Officials said before the wireless test they believed that it would reach about 75 percent of the roughly 225 million cell phones in the country, though they hoped the number would be higher. "
1939,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. There are two ways to fight the long stagnation in living standards for most Americans. The first is probably the more obvious and the one I spend more time writing about: through government policy. The government can raise the minimum wage. It can increase the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is effectively a wage subsidy. It can cut taxes on the middle class. It can spend more money on education, child care and health care. All of these are good ideas. But they’re not the only way to lift living standards. For much of the past century, another approach has been even more important: As the economy grew, American companies paid workers their fair share of the growth. Until the mid-1970s or so, this was the norm. The middle class and poor received larger raises than the affluent, in percentage terms, during the three decades after World War II (as you can see in this chart). Labor unions played a central role, using their power to win raises for unionized and non-unionized members alike. And political pressure and cultural norms also mattered. Corporate executives didn’t feel comfortable maximizing their own pay and their company’s profits at the expense of workers. "
1940,"So there we were, sitting in a purpose-built plexi-walled tube, gazing out on two black reflecting pools from which silver and gold beams shot dramatically toward the night sky. Around us, the historic walls of the Palais du Louvre glowed ghostly in the neon light. Then — boom! The spring collections ended, and Space Force arrived. Not the Trump/Pence kind, the Louis Vuitton-by-Nicolas-Ghesquière kind, dressed up in little silk dresses with maxi shoulder impact, printed with splotches of robots and classical statuary like rips in the space-time continuum. Through which later emerged … sleeves. Enormous billowing sleeves orbited by their own rings of Saturn, sleeves like padded astronaut gauntlets, sleeves bristling tiny shards at the shoulders. Among all the sleeves were ground control jackets and aviator trousers in pale pastels (some almost perfectly androgynous), sparkling mesh overlays, graphic rubberized cocoon coats and metallic floral brocade. Also some egg-like helmet/caps. They had a ticket to ride. Louis Vuitton is, as the brand founded on trunks endlessly reminds us, about travel. Fashion is, as all of us sitting in the spring 2019 shows during autumn 2018 know, about the future. Put it together and you get: laser-focused women on an intergalactic tour to the halls of power! "
1941,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday criticized a New York Times investigation into his and his family’s use of dubious tax schemes over the years and the origins of his own wealth, calling the article an “old, boring and often told hit piece.” Referring to The Times as the “Failing New York Times,” Mr. Trump did not offer an outright denial of the facts in the report, such as that the money he made during his decades in real estate came from tax schemes of dubious legality, the existence of records of deception in documenting the family’s financial assets, and that the beginning of the president’s so-called self-made fortune dates back to his toddler years when, by the time he was 3 years old, Mr. Trump earned $200,000 a year in today’s dollars from his father. Nor did Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, during a subsequent briefing with reporters. Asked to identify what in the article was incorrect, she said, “I won’t go through every line of a very boring 14,000-word story.” Instead, she said the article demonstrated that Mr. Trump’s father believed in him. “One thing the article did get right is it showed that the president’s father actually had a great deal of confidence in him,” she said. “In fact, the president brought his father into a lot of deals and made a lot of money together.” "
1942,"TORONTO — He called his relationship with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada “testy.” But President Trump put that down to heated trade negotiations only. Now that the newly named deal was settled, things between the two men — and by extension, two countries — were supposedly rosy again. “We’ve always had actually a very good relationship,” Mr. Trump told reporters gathered in the Rose Garden on Monday. If you swept a microphone across the length of Canada at that moment, the sound recorded would have been of eyeballs rolling. Millions of them. Canadians are mostly relieved that Nafta 2.0, now called the U.S.M.C.A., was signed and that Mr. Trump’s threats of economic ruination for their country are over. But if he thinks the argument with his neighbor is all patched up, then he is terribly wrong. “The president insulted our country, our prime minister and even our chief negotiator,” said Frank McKenna, a former premier of New Brunswick and a former Canadian ambassador to the United States. "
1943,"WASHINGTON — Senior White House officials, after reviewing summaries of interviews conducted by the F.B.I., are increasingly confident that the information collected will ease the path for senators to confirm Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, a person briefed on the findings said Thursday morning. The material was conveyed to Capitol Hill in the middle of the night, just hours after Senate Republicans set the stage for a pair of votes later in the week to move to approve Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation. A statement issued by the White House around 2:30 a.m. said the F.B.I. had completed its work and that it represented an unprecedented look at a nominee. “The White House has received the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s supplemental background investigation into Judge Kavanaugh, and it is being transmitted to the Senate,” Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, said in the statement, which was posted on Twitter. “This is the last addition to the most comprehensive review of a Supreme Court nominee in history, which includes extensive hearings, multiple committee interviews, over 1,200 questions for the record and over a half million pages of documents,” he added. “With this additional information, the White House is fully confident the Senate will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.” The White House statement gave no further details about the material, but an official briefed on the F.B.I. review said the bureau contacted 10 people and interviewed nine of them. It was not clear why the 10th person was not interviewed. The White House concluded that the interviews did not corroborate sexual misconduct accusations against Judge Kavanaugh, and could help his case, said the person briefed on the findings, who requested anonymity to discuss them. But it is the judgments of senators that will determine Judge Kavanaugh’s fate. Senators will be permitted to review the materials, in what the F.B.I. calls 302 interview summaries, in a secured room at the Capitol starting Thursday morning, or they can be briefed by a handful of staff members who are cleared to examine the material. After a day of review, the Senate is on track to take an initial vote on Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation on Friday and possibly a final vote as early as Saturday. "
1944,"There is nothing subliminal about the aesthetic messaging of the HBO show “Insecure.” The fashion takes a stance: T-shirts bear pointed political messages, the likenesses of black heroes adorn many outfits, and much of the wardrobe is sourced from black designers. It is no coincidence that Shiona Turini, the fashion stylist and consultant behind many music videos, including Beyoncé’s “Formation” and Solange’s “Cranes,” was behind some of this season’s image. This was her first time working as a costume designer on a television show, and she joined midway through Season 3 (Ayanna James was the costume designer on previous episodes and seasons), but Ms. Turini said: “I never want to turn down an opportunity just because I don't have all of the experience in it.” The characters of “Insecure” already had established styles, but Ms. Turini pushed their sensibilities, and their statement-making fashion, even further. “It meant looking at the shows that were happening or coming up and trying to make sure to weave that in — to make it relevant stylistically and culturally,” she said. It also meant looking backward. Ms. Turini pulled inspiration from black television’s golden era — the early 1990s, when characters on shows like “A Different World,” “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,” “The Sinbad Show,” “Martin” and “Living Single” dressed in Afrocentric colors, jewelry and prints. Will Smith’s red, green, yellow and black Cross Colours look on “Fresh Prince” is a classic example. The tagline of the black-owned clothing line, created by Carl Jones and TJ Walker, was, and still is, “clothing without prejudice.” The bold colors they used were meant to invoke “romanticized spaces of mythical unity and nationalistic desire,” according to Kristal Brent Zook, whose book “Colors by Fox: The FOX Network and the Revolution in Black Television” is an analysis of the ways cable networks catered specifically to young, black people in the ’90s. Ms. Turini sees her appreciation and penchant for channeling ’90s-era TV aesthetics as a direct response to what those “lifestyle and fashion choices on TV meant for culture, especially black community and black culture.” "
1945,"The United States, Mexico and Canada finalized a new trade agreement Sunday to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta. The new deal, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, staves off a trade war, reassuring some Canadian readers who said they were pleased with it. But many Canadians took to our comment section to tell us that, more than anything, they are angry over how the deal was achieved. They called the Trump administration’s negotiating tactics “bullying” techniques and “name-calling” rather than diplomacy.

A selection of comments from Canadian readers is below. They have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. If you hold a gun to the head of your much smaller and weaker neighbor to force him to give you a few more apples off his tree, and he complies, I guess you could call that “success.” But no one would call it a reasonable negotiation between friendly neighbors. Let’s be very clear about that. — Nick Wright, Halifax, Nova Scotia This is a bad agreement for Canada. We gave up far too much while the Americans gave up nothing of consequence. We failed to capitalize on Donald Trump’s vulnerability and succumbed to his bullying. We too suffer from bad leadership. Trudeau has made a habit of posturing on issues that are important to Canadians. Then he does exactly the opposite. — Randall, Canada "
1946,"MEMPHIS — Ask Representative Marsha Blackburn about finances and a strong response can follow. When she worked as the state film and music commissioner in Tennessee in 1995, another government official questioned her travel expenses on a trip to California. Ms. Blackburn, who is now the Republican candidate for an open Senate seat in Tennessee, responded by burning her receipts and sending the charred remains with a note that said “copy of LA expense report as requested.” But questions about her spending practices have lingered. In her years as a congresswoman, she has paid out more than $370,000 from her campaign funds to her daughter and son-in-law or firms they control. Her campaigns have received 54 requests for additional information from the Federal Election Commission since 2002, and in a 2008 internal audit the campaign admitted receiving nearly $400,000 in unreported contributions and expenditures. A staunch supporter of President Trump in a state he carried by 26 percentage points, Ms. Blackburn finds herself in a surprisingly competitive race for the seat being vacated by Bob Corker, presenting Democrats with a rare chance to claim a red state Senate seat. One reason is that Ms. Blackburn’s Democratic opponent, Phil Bredesen, is a well known former governor who helped lure an NFL franchise to Nashville when he was the city’s mayor and carried all of the state’s 95 counties when he was re-elected as governor in 2006. With Republicans holding a narrow 51-49 advantage in the Senate, the race is deemed so critical that Republicans have been shoring up Ms. Blackburn’s campaign; on Monday night Mr. Trump appeared at a fund-raiser and rally for her, and pulled her even closer into his orbit, saying “A vote for Marsha is really a vote for me and everything that we stand for.” In that sense, the Tennessee race reflects political and ideological struggles playing out across the country. Ms. Blackburn, 66, is a familiar face on Fox News and identifies herself as a “hard-core, card-carrying Tennessee conservative.” By contrast, Mr. Bredesen, 74, is a centrist Democrat who touts credentials as a pro-business consensus builder. Mr. Bredesen has had his own financial misstep. A longtime booster of the solar industry as governor of Tennessee, he started a solar company with two of his aides during his last year in office, attracting headlines and criticism. After he left office, the business went on to reap some of the tax breaks that the Bredesen administration had put in place. "
1947,"For the past 60 years or so, the Republican Party has declared itself the true party of decentralized government, the founding vision of federalism and what are sometimes called states’ rights. Whether its pious declarations were ever actually about more than securing Southern votes or limiting the rights of women and minorities has always been questionable, but at least in theory the party took federalism seriously. But now, with the party under new management and in control of every branch of the federal government, a profound transformation is underway. States’ rights still get lip service, at least when it comes to matters like limiting transgender rights. But the new reality is that we face a rising nationalist party, uninterested in local variation, aggressively devoted to molding the nation in the image of the party and its leader, Donald Trump, into one white-hot mass. California (surely the state now most tempted to leave the union) is the flash point. This week, it passed its own net neutrality laws, to ban blocking and throttling of the internet, as a stand-in for the federal net neutrality rules abandoned by the Trump administration in June. California has obvious reasons to want to protect an open internet: It is the land of the internet’s origin, and a place where tech entrepreneurship has thrived. If the Republican Party actually believed in economic decentralization, it might well accept the premise of state rules where the federal government explicitly disclaims any authority to act. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a self-declared states’ rights champion, declared within hours of the law’s passage that the Department of Justice will sue California for infringing corporate prerogatives — that is, interfering with the right of cable and phone companies to block or slow internet content. This attack on state net neutrality is no outlier but one of a series of similar invasions of states’ rights undertaken in the name of corporate sovereignty, which, in the age of a new nationalism, has been elevated above state law. The Trump administration is fighting hard to destroy California’s clean air rules, as if California had no legitimate interest in trying to keep its air clean. Likewise, the Republican judiciary has worked hard to transform the First Amendment into a charter of corporate privileges and immunities that invalidates state laws that would dare elevate matters like consumer privacy over an industry’s marginal revenue. Everyone knows that federalism arguments are used opportunistically in American politics and that proponents become opponents as soon as they gain control of the federal government. And there is certainly an element of opportunism in what the Trump administration is doing. But there are broader trends at work here, suggesting a deeper shift in what the Republican Party stands for. "

__________ Aston Martin, the carmaker beloved by James Bond, began trading on the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The debut started poorly. Its stock fell below its initial public offering price of £19 a share. Back story: Aston Martin has struggled during its century-long history, filing for bankruptcy seven times. But the luxury automaker has recently overhauled its car lineup in an attempt to broaden its appeal. Sales are expected to be between 6,200 and 6,400 vehicles this year. It filed to go public in August. The news: Ahead of its I.P.O., Aston Martin — officially Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings — expected to price its shares between £17.50 and £22.50. On Monday, it cut the top end of that range to £20 a share, and ended up pricing just below that at £19. But its stock has fallen in its debut and was trading at £17.65 a share as of midday London time on Wednesday. How it stacks up: Aston Martin hoped to command a valuation similar to that of Ferrari, its Italian rival. Despite its poor start, it succeeded in that goal: Its valuation is currently about 20 times its first-half earnings, according to Bloomberg, not far from where Ferrari trades. (Those multiples are more like those of luxury-goods companies than regular automakers.) What to watch: Aston Martin hopes to sell almost 10,000 vehicles per year by 2020. To avoid a repeat of its checkered history, the company will need to convince investors that it can hit that target. The F.B.I. is expected to finish a new check of Brett Kavanaugh as soon as Wednesday. Lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, said that the inquiry (which may be available only to senators) wasn’t thorough enough. President Trump yesterday mocked Dr. Ford. "
1949,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) San Francisco’s new transit hub, a three-block-long edifice that floats like a cruise ship above downtown streets, was open only six weeks before the discovery of cracks in two massive steel beams prompted officials to close the terminal. On Tuesday, the managers of the project said it would be weeks before the Salesforce Transit Center would reopen. Engineers hope to discover what caused the cracks by analyzing samples of the beams. For some insights we spoke with David Williams, a structural engineer who specializes in large infrastructure projects. Q. One of the stipulations in the construction of the Transbay terminal was that materials had to be sourced in the United States. Given that so much steel is produced outside America these days, was this a potential factor in the quality of the beams that fractured? A. It’s extremely limiting for the project managers to buy this type of American steel. It’s available, but you have a very short list of suppliers and it’s often a special order. It’s like going to get a heart valve from someone who does one every six months instead of every six days. Q. The 1994 Northridge earthquake revealed a flaw in the way large beams were connected and welded. Is there any corollary to what happened with the terminal? A. All the industry’s standards and specifications were upgraded to reflect what was learned after Northridge. But these heavy plate sections are very dependent on welding procedures. And there’s a recognition that if you’re not very careful you can create fracture-prone steel. "
1950,"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans are stepping up efforts to challenge Christine Blasey Ford’s credibility by confronting her with a sworn statement from a former boyfriend who took issue with a number of assertions she made during testimony before the Judiciary Committee last week. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the committee chairman, cited the former boyfriend’s statement in a letter sent Tuesday night to Dr. Blasey’s lawyers demanding that they turn over material that could be used to assess her veracity. President Trump mocked Dr. Blasey during a campaign rally on Tuesday night, mimicking her inability to remember some details from her account of being sexually assaulted by Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh when they were teenagers. The former boyfriend told the Judiciary Committee that he witnessed Dr. Blasey helping a friend prepare for a possible polygraph examination, contradicting her testimony under oath. Dr. Blasey, a psychology professor from California who also goes by her married name Ford, was asked during the hearing whether she had “ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test.” She answered, “Never.” But the former boyfriend, whose name was redacted from a copy of the sworn statement provided by a person supporting Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, said that when they were together in the 1990s he saw Dr. Blasey use her understanding of psychology to assist her roommate of the time, Monica L. McLean, before interviews for possible positions with the F.B.I. or the United States Attorney’s office that might require her to take a lie-detector test. "
1951,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Wednesday that the United States was pulling out of a six-decade-old treaty with Iran that had provided a basis for normalizing relations between the two countries, including diplomatic and economic exchanges. The largely symbolic move came hours after the International Court of Justice ordered the United States to ensure that a new round of American sanctions imposed against Tehran this year did not prevent food, medicine and aircraft parts from reaching Iran. The treaty bears little relevance to the current relationship between Washington and Tehran. The move is the latest in a broad effort by the Trump administration to isolate Iran, reversing a diplomatic drive embraced by former President Barack Obama. The ruling by the international court in The Hague was related to a complaint that Iran filed in July, arguing that the new sanctions violated the Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations and Consular Rights, which was signed in 1955. In essence, the ruling sought to protect Iran’s public and economy from what the court described as irreparable damage while justices continue to consider the case against the sanctions. But in his announcement, Mr. Pompeo made clear that the United States would ignore the ruling — simply by scrapping the bilateral treaty with Iran. “The Iranians have been ignoring it for an awfully long time,” Mr. Pompeo told reporters at the State Department. "
1952,"WASHINGTON — Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has been one of the biggest proponents of President Trump’s crackdown on China, welcoming tariffs on Chinese imports while conceding that they will raise costs for American businesses and consumers. “There is no way for us to address China without absorbing some pain here,” Mr. Graham said in August. But behind the scenes, Mr. Graham has been working to help chemical and textile companies in his home state avoid the pain of Mr. Trump’s trade war. The senator has advocated on behalf of seven South Carolina companies that import products from China, writing letters urging the Trump administration to remove materials they rely on from a list of goods subject to Mr. Trump’s tariffs. Mr. Trump’s tariffs, Mr. Graham told the administration, could “economically harm consumers and stifle economic growth in South Carolina.” The senator has written seven letters to the United States trade representative on behalf of companies seeking tariff relief — more than any other member of Congress has penned. Four of those seven received at least some of the relief they were seeking. The jockeying to protect South Carolina companies highlights the tension inherent in Mr. Trump’s trade war, which is aimed at punishing China with tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods but is hurting many American companies in the process. Businesses across the United States have grown by embracing the global economy — producing, selling and buying goods from countries across the world, including China. As Mr. Trump threatens to impose even more tariffs on Chinese imports, many companies are appealing to the administration for relief — creating winners and losers in the process. "

he way a country is seen through the lens of Hollywood can be a powerful thing, so what are we to make of Australia’s presence in two of Netflix’s most talked about shows: “The Good Place” and “Ozark”? If you haven’t seen them, here’s a quick rundown. • “The Good Place” is “an ingenious metaphysical sitcom,” according to our critic James Poniewozik, which involves four characters trying to move from hell (the bad place) to heaven. The new season sends them to Sydney for a chance at redemption. • “Ozark” is a dark drama about an upper-middle-class family caught up in money laundering for Mexican drug cartels. Our reviewer compared it to “Breaking Bad.” And this season they’re hoping to flee the mayhem, to Mullumbimby. There’s already been quite a lot of chatter in Australia about “The Good Place” and its bad Aussie accents. I don’t think I’m spoiling much by pointing out that they are in part intentional according to the show’s creator, Mike Schur, who is well known for affectionate skewering in his previous creations, “Parks and Recreation,” and “Brooklyn Nine-Nine.” We have a big profile of him in this week’s magazine, pointing out his strict “no jerks” rule on set. But for “The Good Place,” he seems especially eager to toy with Australian-American relations, and not just with the accent: The next episode involves a restaurant called the Cowboy Skyscraper Buffet, which Mr. Schur described as “a reverse Outback Steakhouse” in which the United States has its culture misappropriated and made cliché. "
1954,"WASHINGTON — The United States imposed sanctions on Thursday against a Turkish company and two of its officers for doing business with North Korea, sending a tough signal to Pyongyang ahead of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s expected visit there this weekend. The Treasury Department accused S.I.A. Falcon International Group of being involved in trading weapons and luxury goods with North Korea, defying sanctions imposed by both the United States and the United Nations. “The international community must not stand idly by as U.N. sanctions are being circumvented,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a press statement. The United States placed individual sanctions on Huseyin Sahin, S.I.A.’s chief executive, and Erhan Culha, its general manager. Also sanctioned was Ri Song Un, a North Korean diplomat serving in Mongolia who was hosted by S.I.A. in Turkey to negotiate the deals, according to the United States. Thursday’s sanctions were intended to send two messages: that the Trump administration will continue to ratchet up economic pressure on Pyongyang until North Korea ends its nuclear and ballistic missile weapons programs, and that the relationship between the United States and Turkey continues to be troubled. The Trump administration has issued hundreds of similar sanctions this year and is expected to put in place hundreds more. It is unusual for the United States to impose such economic penalties on citizens and companies in allied countries, such as Turkey, which is a NATO member. Even so, the Trump administration has deployed sanctions as one of its most important tools of foreign policy. "
1955,"KABUL, Afghanistan — A new crop of senior American officials in Afghanistan has been racing to contain a dual crisis on the battlefield and in a potentially explosive election dispute. But it is a different American figure — the mercenary executive Erik D. Prince — who has been the talk of Kabul these days. More than a year after first laying out his plan to President Trump to privatize the American war in Afghanistan with a cadre of contractors — and a private air force — Mr. Prince, the founder of the Blackwater security firm that became infamous for killing civilians in Iraq, has seemingly been everywhere. And as he has made his sales pitch directly to a host of influential Afghans, he has frequently been introduced as an adviser to Mr. Trump himself. Mr. Prince is pushing his plan at a particularly vulnerable time for the country. Afghan security forces are dying at a record number of 30 to 40 a day largely in a defensive posture against a Taliban that has gained territory. The government is beset by repeated political crises as parliamentary elections, delayed for three years, are scheduled for this month. Presidential elections are set for April. Interviews with a half-dozen political figures who have met Mr. Prince in recent months — as well as an interview with Mr. Prince by The New York Times during his trip to Kabul in September — reveal an executive determined to sell a vision of how his contractors could offer an official military withdrawal from Afghanistan to a war-weary American public and president. Now, those officials say, he has increasingly found a receptive audience among Afghanistan’s power brokers, meeting everyone from lowly militia commanders, to former cabinet officials and entrenched regional strongmen, to several potential presidential candidates. "
1956,"When I ran from Senator Jeff Flake’s office door to the elevator last Friday and put my arm in to stop it from closing, I wasn’t thinking about what would come next. I had no idea what I was about to say. But when he would not look at me, or the woman standing next to me baring her soul, I felt only fury. Recounting trauma is powerful but emotionally taxing. It is perhaps more so when the person you are recounting it to won’t look you in the eye, refuses to shake your hand or walks into a bathroom to ignore you. What those actions — how Mr. Flake first responded to us and how other senators have responded to other survivors — demonstrate is that the person is ashamed. If Mr. Flake had been confident in his decision to vote yes on Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination, he would have looked me in the face, point blank and explained why he was going to do what he believed in. What his refusal to look at me told me was that even though his actions were going to affect women, he didn’t want to confront them. I wanted him to look in my eyes and acknowledge my pain; it was clear that he wished he could have stayed in his office and not faced those whose lives would be affected by his actions. And yet, frustrating as it can be, a sense of shame can also provide an important opening. Those four minutes in the elevator with Mr. Flake were a whirlwind, but I will never forget his eyes after I pleaded with him to look at me, to not look away. When he looked up, I didn’t see a senator. I saw a man, torn between his conscience and his party. And he saw me, a young woman trying to make a difference in the way that we can in a democracy: by using her voice. The question of whether to support a Supreme Court nominee who has been accused of sexual assault should not be partisan. This is about the treatment of survivors. It is about telling us that what happens to us matters. That our traumas are not something to be ignored but are to be believed and investigated. Fully investigated. "

1964,"SAN FRANCISCO — “I want to apologize,” the Facebook executive wrote last Friday in a note to staff. “I recognize this moment is a deeply painful one — internally and externally.” The apology came from Joel Kaplan, Facebook’s vice president for global public policy. A day earlier, Mr. Kaplan had sat behind his friend, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, when the judge testified in Congress about allegations he had sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school. Mr. Kaplan’s surprise appearance prompted anger and shock among many Facebook employees, some of whom said they took his action as a tacit show of support for Judge Kavanaugh — as if it were an endorsement from Facebook itself. The unrest quickly spilled over onto Facebook’s internal message boards, where hundreds of workers have since posted about their concerns, according to current and former employees. To quell the hubbub, Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, last Friday explained in a widely attended staff meeting that Mr. Kaplan was a close friend of Judge Kavanaugh’s and had broken no company rules, these people said. Yet the disquiet within the company has not subsided. This week, Facebook employees kept flooding internal forums with comments about Mr. Kaplan’s appearance at the hearing. In a post on Wednesday, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive, appeared to dismiss the concerns when he wrote to employees that “it is your responsibility to choose a path, not that of the company you work for.” Facebook plans to hold another staff meeting on Friday to contain the damage, said the current and former employees. The internal turmoil at Facebook — described by six current and former employees and a review of internal posts — illustrates how divisions over Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court have cascaded into unexpected places and split one of the world’s biggest tech companies. Mr. Kaplan’s show of support for Judge Kavanaugh hits a particularly sensitive spot for Facebook. It has been weathering claims from conservatives and Mr. Trump that Facebook is biased against right-wing websites and opinions. The company has denied this, saying it is a neutral platform that welcomes all perspectives. By showing up at Judge Kavanaugh’s side, Mr. Kaplan essentially appeared to choose a political side that goes against the views of Facebook’s largely liberal work force. "
1965,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] We’re going to start this evening by using our imaginations. So take a seat in the sharing circle and pretend that today, Oct. 4, is Election Day. On Capitol Hill, Republicans are cautiously optimistic, sensing they’re just a day or so away from confirming Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Republican voters, outraged by the treatment of their nominee in Congress, are more fired up than they’ve been since the midterms began. They flock to the polls, eager to defend their majority. Democratic voters are out in droves, too. But the toughest Senate races are being fought in states that President Trump won in 2016. So things are looking bleak for incumbents like Heidi Heitkamp, Claire McCaskill and even Jon Tester. That’s the image many Republicans were painting of the midterms this morning. But here’s the thing (and it’s a biggie): Today is not Election Day. "

1967,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Brett Kavanaugh’s prospects of being confirmed to the Supreme Court appeared to be on the upswing through the afternoon, after senators had a chance to look at the F.B.I. investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct against him. Two Republican senators who could hold the deciding votes, Jeff Flake of Arizona, above, and Susan Collins of Maine, sounded positive after a closed-door meeting in which they were told that no witnesses had corroborated the accounts of Judge Kavanaugh’s main accusers. Senate Democrats were critical of the report, saying it left out many key witnesses. We gathered comments from senators on the left and right. A key vote in the full Senate could come tomorrow, confirmation possibly this weekend. Here is what readers are telling us about the message that would send. "

1969,"Updated, Nov. 2018 with links to some of the classroom projects described below. There’s a lot to read and talk about this election season. As we wrote in September, this primary season has been full of surprises. There are highly competitive races that might — or might not — lead to a “blue wave”; divisive issues like immigration, health care, gun control and the Supreme Court; the continuing Mueller investigation; questions surrounding elections and social media; and, of course, the role of President Trump — and former President Barack Obama — in who will vote, why and how. And that was before the current Supreme Court nomination fight that has dominated headlines for weeks. To help educators prepare for the final month leading up to the midterms, we have collected a range of ideas submitted by teachers and added some of our own to create this list of seven ways to use the midterms as an opportunity for teaching and learning. If you have any other ideas to add, please share them in the comments section. The Times recently published an “Everything You Need to Know” guide to the midterm elections that asks and answers many of the same questions students might have about the midterms. The authors went out of their way to provide succinct answers to questions like... ■ When are the midterms?
■ What’s at stake in Washington?
■ What about outside of Washington? Before you show your students the guide, however, you might conduct a K-W-L activity in which students share what they already know about the midterms and generate questions about what they wonder.

1970,"All fall, news sources have been reporting that the pace of new voter registrations among young people is accelerating. After the Parkland school shooting — and with heated emotions for and against President Trump — perhaps young Americans will show up at the polls in record numbers. But in 2014, in the last midterm elections, fewer than one in five 18-29 year olds voted. Four years before that, the number was only slightly better: fewer than one in four. Will this year be notably different? In this lesson plan, we ask students: Why do you think so many young people don’t vote? Is it important that they do vote? And what can we do, as a society, to get more young people to the polls? _________ Warm Up Students: Take a few minutes to write down your thoughts about these three questions. Then discuss your ideas in pairs or small groups, before sharing with the whole class: 1. Midterm elections happen every four years, two years before (and after) presidential elections. In the last midterms in 2014, only 17.1 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds voted. That means over four out of five eligible voters in that age group didn’t vote. (Side note: Significantly more young people vote in presidential elections.) The question is: Why do you think so many young people don’t vote in midterm elections? And, why do you think young people vote less frequently than other age groups? List as many reasons as you can. 2. The 2018 midterm elections are on Nov. 6. Voters will choose, depending on their state and city, who will represent them in Congress; who will be their next governor or attorney general; and who will be their mayor or local judge. Why do you think it is important for young people to vote in these elections? 3. When you turn 18, do you plan to vote in midterm elections? If you are 18, will you vote in November? Why, or why not?

1971,"There was laundry to be done for Okwui Okpokwasili, a choreographer and performer, as she walked out of her Brooklyn home early last month toward a laundromat. She was getting ready to fly to Berlin that night and, adding to her irritation, she kept missing calls from an unidentified number. When Ms. Okpokwasili, 46, returned the call, an automated voice message provided no clarity. Maybe she was getting spammed, she thought. Then her phone rang again showing the same number, and she picked up on the street. A man with a friendly voice asked if she was alone. “I was like, ‘This tone doesn’t feel like a spamming tone.’ So I dialed back my aggro-ness,” Ms. Okpokwasili said, and then she found a tree away from prying ears to stand under. The man had been trying to get in touch to tell her she was receiving one of this year’s 25 John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation fellowships. Commonly if not officially known as “genius” grants, they recognize “exceptional creativity” in various fields and come with no-strings-attached awards of $625,000 each, distributed over five years. [See the full list of winners.] The selection process, and the people who choose the winners, are kept mostly confidential, but 20 to 30 fellows are picked every year, with the hope that the money and recognition will help spur more creative work. There are no applications for the award. Past winners include Lin-Manuel Miranda and David Simon, but most of the recipients are less well known. "

Here’s what you need to know: • Kavanaugh confirmation appears near. The White House, after reviewing the F.B.I.’s completed investigation, concluded there was no evidence to corroborate sexual misconduct allegations against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The agency’s report — a single copy was available to lawmakers behind closed doors — seemed to satisfy Republican senators as well, increasing the chances of his confirmation.

1973,"The playwright Lucas Hnath made his Broadway debut last year with a drama starring Laurie Metcalf in an imagined sequel for one of the most famous women in theater history, Nora Helmer of Ibsen’s “A Doll’s House.” Next year, Mr. Hnath will return to Broadway with a drama starring Ms. Metcalf in an imagined alternate universe for one of the most famous women in politics: Hillary Rodham Clinton. “Hillary and Clinton” is a play that depicts a 2008 evening in which a presidential candidate named Hillary Clinton, struggling in Iowa against a more charismatic opponent, calls on her husband for help. The play will be the first with Mrs. Clinton as a protagonist to reach Broadway (a musical featuring a fictionalized Mrs. Clinton, called “Soft Power,” had a production in Los Angeles and San Francisco this year and is being revised for the Public Theater, which is Off Broadway). Ms. Metcalf, who won a Tony Award last year for her role in Mr. Hnath’s “A Doll’s House, Part 2,” and another one this year in Edward Albee’s “Three Tall Women,” will star opposite John Lithgow, also a two-time Tony winner, for “The Changing Room” and “Sweet Smell of Success.” The play will be directed by Joe Mantello. The play will begin previews on March 16 and open April 18. The theater has not been announced. “Hillary and Clinton” was first staged in 2016 — when the real Mrs. Clinton was on her way to becoming the Democratic nominee for president — at the Victory Gardens Theater in Chicago. Critical response varied — in the Chicago Tribune, Chris Jones called it “an audacious, whip-smart, highly entertaining piece of writing,” but in The New York Times, Charles Isherwood said the play “doesn’t venture far enough.” There have been productions since at the Philadelphia Theater Company, at HATTheater in Richmond, Va., and at the Second Thought Theater in Dallas. In each of those productions, as in the one in Chicago, “Hillary” was played by an African-American woman. In the years since the play was written and first staged, Mrs. Clinton lost the 2016 presidential race to Donald J. Trump, and Mr. Hnath made an auspicious Broadway debut — his play “A Doll’s House Part 2” was a critical success and is now the most-produced play (other than Shakespeare and Christmas standards) in America. He is now revising “Hillary and Clinton” for the New York production. “Hillary and Clinton” is to be the fifth play this season produced on Broadway by Scott Rudin, who is also producing “Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus,” “King Lear,” “To Kill a Mockingbird” and “The Waverly Gallery.” "
1974,"AMERICUS, Ga. — Lorena Barnum Sabbs thought the past really was past. Born 67 years ago in a segregated hospital, she was arrested when she was 11 for trying to integrate the local movie theater and locked in a stockade for several days without beds, working toilets or running water. Later, as one of the first black girls to attend the formerly whites-only high school, she ventured to the bathroom only in groups for fear of attacks. “I was the recipient of that hate and disrespect, and I thought, I have finally outlived it,” she said. “I was wrong.” Nearly two years after Donald J. Trump’s election, with racial divisions increasingly in public view and voting rights under regular attack, Ms. Sabbs is one of a small army of African-American women across the South using networks originally forged in segregation to muster turnout for Democratic candidates in the November elections. They are mobilizing in conservative states and districts, hoping to pull off upsets like Doug Jones’s stunning Senate victory last year in Alabama, where 98 percent of black women voted for him and proved a critical base of support. In Columbus, Ga., women sit in the fellowship hall of the Emmanuel Christian Community Church, clipboards at the ready to register voters. In Panama City, Fla., sorority sisters park themselves at a street corner across from an imperiled elementary school, holding signs reminding people to vote. And in Greenville, Miss., the mayor of a nearby town founded by sharecroppers says she will not give up on coaxing young people to the polls, even as they complain their votes don’t matter. As both political parties prepare for what many see as the most consequential midterm elections in memory, black women’s votes will be critical. Exit polls consistently indicate they are the single most loyal Democratic voting bloc. "
1975,"Updated, Oct. 5, 2018: Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh cleared a major hurdle Friday morning in his quest for the Supreme Court, as the Senate voted narrowly to cut off debate on his nomination and move to a final vote as early as Saturday. Read the latest, here. WASHINGTON — A deeply divided Senate began a critical procedural vote Friday morning on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, with one key undecided senator, Susan Collins of Maine, saying her “yes” vote to end debate will not necessarily reflect her final vote on his confirmation. Ms. Collins’s “yes” almost guaranteed that Judge Kavanaugh will advance to a final vote, likely on Saturday. She said she will announce her final position at 3 p.m. But uncertainty still hangs over the confirmation. One day after they reviewed the results of an F.B.I. investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, senior Democrats and Republicans took to the Senate floor to deliver their closing arguments for and against a nomination that has torn apart the Senate and the nation. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Judiciary Committee chairman, accused Democrats of waging a scorched-earth campaign to destroy Judge Kavanaugh — “the most qualified nominee in our nation’s history” — before he could be confirmed. He said that the burden of proof for the nominee’s accusers had not been met and that ample investigation had found no evidence to corroborate their claims. “We had a campaign of distraction from his outstanding qualifications. A campaign of destruction of this individual,” Mr. Grassley said. “What we have learned is the resistance that has existed since the day after the November 2016 election is centered right here on Capitol Hill. They have encouraged mob rule.” "
1976,"In the end, it didn’t really matter how many women begged them not to do this, how many times women said slow down, stop, please, no. As of this writing, it seems inevitable that Republicans in the Senate are going to shove Brett Kavanaugh down our throats. According to polls, a majority of American women believe that Christine Blasey Ford told the truth when she said Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her. But the United States Senate is run by Republican men, and thanks to them, Kavanaugh will most likely soon be on the Supreme Court, deciding, among other things, how much control women will be permitted over our own bodies. The restarted F.B.I. background check that seemed, a week ago, like a merciful concession to decency has instead been a cover-up. Agents didn’t even question Blasey or Kavanaugh. It’s not clear if they interviewed any of the more than 20 corroborating witnesses named by Deborah Ramirez, who claimed a drunken, aggressive Kavanaugh thrust his genitals into her face when they were students at Yale. The New Yorker reported that witnesses who tried to contact the F.B.I. were ignored; some ended up submitting unsolicited statements to the bureau. Ultimately, according to the White House, the F.B.I. interviewed a total of nine people in its new review. Based on what they said, Republican leaders have declared that Blasey’s story remains uncorroborated. They’ve made plans for a procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s confirmation on Friday, and expect a floor vote on Saturday. The behavior of Senate Republicans is not particularly surprising. Time and again, they’ve clucked disapprovingly about Donald Trump’s vulgarity while eagerly carrying out his agenda. What has truly shaken me is the zeal with which Republican officeholders and conservative commentators, some of whom I’d thought better of, have come to Kavanaugh’s defense. Something in the spectacle of a highly credentialed Republican man nearly being denied his life’s goal on nothing but the word of a couple of women has brought out the inner Trump in a lot of people. Conservatives will say that they’re protecting an innocent man unfairly accused, not standing up for white male impunity as a principle. They either don’t believe Blasey, or they think that, in the absence of further proof, Kavanaugh should be given the benefit of the doubt, which in this case means a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. They think they’re the ones who are being fair and judicious. “One side is standing on evidence,” tweeted Commentary’s Noah Rothman. “The other on intuition and sentiment.” In fact, both sides are standing on intuition — about who is credible, and which sorts of stories ring true. Evaluating what Blasey said — and what Ramirez has reportedly said, since she wasn’t called to testify — is necessarily subjective. But there is clear, substantial evidence that Kavanaugh has not been truthful throughout this process. Conservatives, in their anger, won’t reckon honestly with this evidence. "
1977,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Blame in Indonesia, a late-night announcement in Washington, an arrest in France. Here’s the latest: • What went wrong in Indonesia? As the death toll continues to rise on Sulawesi Island — to 1,407 on Wednesday — officials are trying to understand why an early warning system for earthquakes and tsunamis failed to protect the island. The system was set up in 2008, with seismographic sensors, buoys and tidal gauges. But a combination of vandalism, maintenance shortfalls and infrastructure damaged by the earthquake meant residents didn’t receive enough warning to evacuate. _____ • The F.B.I. completes its Kavanaugh report. Early Thursday, the White House sent the Senate the completed F.B.I. investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, saying it was “confident” that he would be confirmed to the court. The White House issued its statement around 2:30 a.m., just hours after Senate Republicans moved to schedule a vote on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. "
1978,"A federal judge in San Francisco blocked the Trump administration from ending special protections for immigrants from four countries devastated by war and natural disaster, temporarily relieving more than 300,000 people from the threat of deportation. Immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan — some of whom have spent two decades in the United States — cheered Wednesday’s decision to retain the program, which was signed into law in 1990 by President George Bush. The program includes more than 263,000 Salvadorans, almost 59,000 Haitians, more than 5,000 Nicaraguans and more than 1,000 Sudanese, according to the court. The judge, Edward M. Chen, did not rule on the merits of the case. But in the injunction, he said the beneficiaries, if deported, “indisputably will suffer irreparable harm and great hardship,” many having to choose between bringing their American-born children with them or splitting their families apart. The injunction was another instance of a judge using President Trump’s own words on immigration against him. Judge Chen cited comments in the president’s speeches and Twitter posts as evidence of an “animus against nonwhite, non-European immigrants.” He wrote that there was “circumstantial evidence of race being a motivating factor.” The administration, committed to reining in both legal and illegal immigration, says the program has turned into a quasi-permanent benefit, and that the countries no longer face the hardships they did when protection was granted. The government rescinded the status for Bosnia and Herzegovina after a civil war in the 1990s, and for Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia after the Ebola crisis in 2014. The court’s decision is likely to be appealed. Devin O’Malley, a Department of Justice spokesman, said the ruling “usurps the role of the executive branch in our constitutional order.” "

1980,"How hard could it be to get Flight of the Conchords together for a single show? After all, this comedic folk-rock band consists entirely of Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie, longtime friends from their college days at New Zealand’s Victoria University of Wellington, who hoped their satirical songs and deadpan banter would someday propel them far beyond the bar scene. Today, corralling the two creative partners for gigs like their coming HBO concert special, “Flight of the Conchords: Live in London,” which makes its debut on Saturday, is no easy feat. In the nine years since their self-titled HBO sitcom came to an end, their individual careers have blossomed: Mr. McKenzie, 42, is an Academy Award-winning songwriter for “The Muppets” and Mr. Clement, 44, stars on TV shows like “Legion” and in films like “Moana.” They’re family men too, with wives and children, and not always eager to undertake the grueling warm-up tours that precede a big concert taping (which will also be released as a Sub Pop album later this fall). Then in March, as they were getting to record the show at London’s Eventim Apollo Theater, Mr. McKenzie broke two bones in his left hand. (He’s fine now, and the special was recorded in July.) At last, Mr. Clement and Mr. McKenzie arrived in New York in late September to talk about the long road that led to “Live in London” and their unexpectedly complicated creative process. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. This concert special had been in the works for some time, and then it had to be delayed when Bret injured himself this past spring. What happened? BRET McKENZIE The day before we were going to film the HBO special, I fell down the stairs in an old house in London and landed weirdly on the edge of a wooden step. I had multiple fractures in my hand and couldn’t play guitar. It was quite frightening to have something like that potentially change your career. "
1981,"The reckoning has come for BoJack Horseman. Netflix’s washed-up Hollywood star has recklessly abused his power for four seasons: harassing his ghostwriter, goading his sober co-star into a bender that kills her, coming on to a friend’s teenage daughter. He’s escaped accountability at each turn, all of his messes wiped clean by press agents and glossed over with star power. Only in the new season, to put it in the animated show’s anthropomorphic terms, do the chickens come home to roost. It’s a season about consequences, or the lack thereof. And it gives us an unflinching close-up of a famous abuser that only fiction could pull off right now. It’s been a year since Harvey Weinstein was unmasked as a serial sexual abuser, lighting a fire that blazed through Hollywood and licked at the feet of its TV writers. Now #MeToo plots are proliferating on screen. Television is nimble — it moves faster than film and publishing — and it’s formed the front line of the entertainment industry’s cultural response to its own crisis. Seemingly every genre of show has located an angle: the headline-ripping procedural (“The Good Fight”), the misanthropic sitcom (“It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia”), the frothy romantic comedy (“Younger”), and the broadcast news satire (the “Murphy Brown” reboot). There’s a podcast serial, too: “The Off Season,” which follows a fictional television host as he’s exiled to a Montauk hideaway while his network investigates sexual harassment allegations against him. How much these shows get out of the issue hinges on how much they put into it. Some collapse trauma into a 20- to 40-minute episode, chopping it into beats and bending it into arcs. But a few understand that the subject is big enough to fill entire seasons. "
1982,"When President Trump’s tax law passed last year, Republicans in many high-tax districts faced a revolt over a key provision — a $10,000 cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT. The limit proved so toxic that it was a key reason 12 Republican members of the House of Representatives voted against the bill, including four of the five Republicans from New Jersey. The furor over the tax law seemed to ebb, but last week the House voted to make the tax overhaul permanent, resurrecting a hot-button issue for Democrats in close races, particularly in wealthy suburbs. And Republicans are suddenly having to reconcile their party’s position with the anger of many of their tax-weary constituents. Some Republicans are trying to neutralize the issue by saying that they support the tax law, but oppose the SALT cap. Or they are declaring that in negotiating the law, they fought to ensure the deduction was not eliminated altogether. “We embrace it, I’m running on it, and I think our party should be a party of pro-growth ideas, confidence and optimism,” said New Jersey Assemblyman Jay Webber, a Republican seeking a seat made available by a retiring Republican. "
1983,"In the 2016 election, Donald J. Trump tapped into a sentiment strongly held by white working-class voters that America had changed so much around them that they felt estranged in their own country. The sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild described that feeling among conservative voters in Louisiana in her 2016 book, “Strangers in Their Own Land.” In pre-election polling, that belief strongly predicted support for Mr. Trump among working-class whites. And in postelection analyses of those voters, the same sense of estrangement kept coming up. But for all its associations with Trump voters, the mood appears to have spread over the last two years. In a series of competitive congressional districts where The New York Times has been polling the midterm electorate, nearly half of Democrats say they feel this way — slightly more than among Republicans. Forty-seven percent of voters who approve of Mr. Trump say they feel like strangers in their own country, while 44 percent of those who disapprove of him say the same. Nearly half of women feel this way. About 60 percent of African-Americans and Asian-Americans do. A majority of voters say this in West Virginia coal country and in a deeply conservative Kentucky district. But the feeling is also common in the highly educated suburbs of Orange County, Calif. The seven districts that we’ve polled on that question — talking to 3,555 likely voters in California, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota and West Virginia — are not representative of the entire country. But they contain communities that are pulling ahead in America and those that are falling behind, as well as places that mirror the nation’s demographic future and its past. "
1984,"BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY BURN AGAIN
Democracy, Rebellion, and Revolution
By Ben Fountain
433 pp. Ecco/HarperCollins Publishers. $27.99. Ben Fountain thinks that the election of Donald J. Trump has led to a crisis as calamitous as the Civil War and the Great Depression. This, of course, is a stretch. That’s the point. Fountain’s mission with his forceful new essay collection, “Beautiful Country Burn Again,” is to pull readers out of their shortsighted social media stupor to consider the state of social and economic justice in America. Not that he tells you so easily. Fountain doesn’t offer a neat, tidy story about the rise of Trump and the implications of his presidency. “Beautiful Country Burn Again” is a whirling journey centered on a knotty, academic equation that Fountain believes is both the cause of America’s tensions and the impetus for constant reinvention: “Profit proportionate to freedom; plunder correlative to subjugation.” If that seems hard to understand, it’s because it is. At times, I wished Fountain would dumb it down a bit, but the man Malcolm Gladwell labeled a “genius” refuses. You get the feeling Fountain, a lawyer by training, is marshaling every bit of his intellect in an attempt to smarten everyone else up. For this work, the highly acclaimed novelist behind “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” and the story collection “Brief Encounters With Che Guevara” brandishes a full array of literary tools, including song, verse, historical anecdotes, piles of research and plenty of satisfying takedowns to keep you on his ride. All necessary because his central point can be hard to hold onto. In plain terms, the kind Fountain most certainly despises, “Beautiful Country Burn Again” is about white supremacy. As he sees it, a third major existential crisis, after the Civil War and the Great Depression, is upon us, a moment of structural impasse that will demand a “reinvention” for us to overcome (led, hopefully, by the likes of a Lincoln or a Roosevelt). "
1985,"WASHINGTON — Western allies accused Russian intelligence officers on Thursday of launching cyberattacks against organizations around the globe that challenged Russian wrongdoing, exposed Kremlin disinformation campaigns or took on President Vladimir V. Putin. Officers operating near Red Square sought to hack the British foreign ministry, antidoping agencies in Colorado Springs and Canada, and investigators examining the shooting down of a Malaysian passenger jet over Ukraine in 2014, the officials said. Other Russian officers armed with mobile computer equipment traveled to the Netherlands in April to tap into the headquarters of the world’s chemical weapons watchdog, which was investigating the poisoning in Britain a month earlier of a Russian former spy and his daughter. Those officers were caught and expelled. Seeking to deter Moscow, officials in Washington, London and Amsterdam released extraordinarily detailed accounts of Russian misdeeds on Thursday in intelligence reports and a Justice Department indictment charging seven Russian officers. They named the officers, published photographs of them and their equipment, and released maps charting their travel and their targets. One officer caught in the Netherlands, they said, was carrying a receipt for a taxi ride to the Moscow airport from the street outside the headquarters of the military intelligence agency formerly known as the G.R.U. The complaints echoed the case that British authorities recently made against Russia in the poisoning of the former spy, Sergei V. Skripal, by publishing photographs of two Russian officers and other evidence. American officials also expanded the constellation of cyberattacks they blamed on Russia, which they had previously limited to election interference. "
1986,"MILLCREEK, Utah — Ben McAdams, a candidate for Congress, was speed-walking along the highway shoulder in his business suit, safety and common sense be damned. “We’ll make it,” he said, as the trucks whistled by, blowing dust into the Utah sun. In his bid to unseat Representative Mia Love, a Republican, Mr. McAdams has been trying to do just that — make it, in this case to the United States House as a Democrat from a state that runs about as red as the desert is dry. The district he seeks to represent, Utah’s Fourth, is a boot-shaped expanse extending south from Salt Lake City where fewer than 15 percent of the voters are registered Democrats. In any other year, a McAdams win would seem improbable. Ms. Love, the only black Republican woman in Congress, won her last election by nearly 13 points, and many voters see her as an outgoing leader in a place where women — especially conservative women — are rarities in the halls of power. She is the sole Republican member of the Congressional Black Caucus, making her an uncommon symbol of bipartisanship in an era of deep division. But this is Utah, where Mormon values dominate political choices and voters largely rejected Donald Trump, whose crass commentary and hard line on immigration clash with church doctrine, garnering him just 45 percent of the vote in 2016. Nationally, Democrats see the district as one of their best chances to move into red territory. And if Mr. McAdams plays it just right, there is bipartisan acknowledgment that he could win, particularly because he is the twice-elected mayor of Salt Lake County, home to 85 percent of the district. The Cook Political Report is now declaring the race a Republican tossup. “She and other congressional Republicans have failed us in their moral duty,” said Jordan Roberts, 33, a doctor and former Republican who rushed through a crowd to speak with Mr. McAdams at the opening of a new health clinic near the highway. “I feel like she’s been a yes-man for the current administration.” "

A few hours earlier, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, took steps that would set an initial vote on the nomination for Friday. The moves came despite complaints from Democrats that investigators did not interview key witnesses. But Mr. McConnell has come to see his nearly singular responsibility as adding conservatives to the federal courts. “There is no chance in the world that they’re going to scare us out of doing our duty,” he said on Wednesday. • “A lack of judicial temperament”: Over 1,000 law professors signed a letter opposing Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation. • A guide: Here’s an overview of the nomination’s twists and turns.

1989,"We always knew President Trump was being misleading when he portrayed himself as a self-made man. But until Tuesday’s bombshell Times story, we did not know the breathtaking scale of the deception, or the extent to which his wealth was built on tax evasion. This raises two questions. First, what can and should tax authorities do about the specific allegations of tax evasion and fraud by the Trump family detailed in the article? Second, what can lawmakers do to ensure that those who inherit extraordinary sums are paying their fair share? While the statute of limitations has already passed for many of the alleged violations, the Trump family still can be pursued for civil tax fraud. This could result in family members owing back taxes, interest and penalties. New York State and New York City have already announced they will investigate. The Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice should, too — potentially by appointing a special counsel. These agencies should not just look at the estate tax, but also at whether the Trump family committed income tax fraud. For example, did the president and his siblings claim the properties they inherited had a different — and much higher — value for income tax purposes than the lowball valuations claimed for the estate tax? But even if the tax authorities cannot make the Trumps pay the taxes they evaded because of the time elapsed, the article raises a much broader issue: People who live off inheritances pay tax at much lower rates than people who earn their income through good, old-fashioned hard work. In 2009, for example, the average federal tax rate on income from work and savings was about 18 percent, compared with 4 percent for inherited income. The Trumps are an extreme example of a more general problem. The tax advantages for heirs are partly due to fundamental problems in the law. Income from wealth is taxed very lightly and sometimes not at all. Moreover, our income and payroll taxes allow heirs to exclude everything they inherit from their tax returns, no matter how vast. The estate and gift taxes were meant to partly address this omission, but they have been cut relentlessly over time, falling from 2.6 percent of federal revenues in 1972 to less than 1 percent today, even while the share of wealth and income held by those at the very top soared. "
1990,"The stakes — already sky-high — for both the Trump administration and the Democratic Party in the coming congressional elections have been raised even higher by the struggle over the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. Not only will the outcome be interpreted as a renunciation or vindication of the Trump presidency, it will also determine whether Democrats have recouped since the 2016 disaster and where the balance of power within the Republican Party lies. Should the House change hands (a likely prospect) and possibly the Senate (much less likely), President Trump’s exposure on two potentially inflammatory subjects will be exponentially greater. Congressional hearings and investigations will display to the public the tangled web of Trump’s financial, real estate and tax dealings, and his relationships with, and payoffs to, women with whom he allegedly had extramarital affairs. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The November election will also determine whether the regulatory decisions of executive branch agencies, especially the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency, are subject to critical review. Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform are already armed with 64 subpoena requests on subjects running from Russian election interference to foreign payments to the Trump organization to charges that the departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services withheld documents on the Trump administration’s child separation policy. If Elijah Cummings of Baltimore, the ranking Democrat on the Oversight Committee, becomes chairman, he will no longer make requests to hold committee hearings and write letters asking for subpoenas. He will schedule hearings and issue subpoenas. "
1991,"For the first time since Donald Trump entered the political fray, I find myself grateful that he’s in it. I’m reluctant to admit it and astonished to say it, especially since the president mocked Christine Blasey Ford in his ugly and gratuitous way at a rally on Tuesday. Perhaps it’s worth unpacking this admission for those who might be equally astonished to read it. I’m grateful because Trump has not backed down in the face of the slipperiness, hypocrisy and dangerous standard-setting deployed by opponents of Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court. I’m grateful because ferocious and even crass obstinacy has its uses in life, and never more so than in the face of sly moral bullying. I’m grateful because he’s a big fat hammer fending off a razor-sharp dagger. A few moments have crystallized my view over the past few days. The first moment was a remark by a friend. “I’d rather be accused of murder,” he said, “than of sexual assault.” I feel the same way. One can think of excuses for killing a man; none for assaulting a woman. But if that’s true, so is this: Falsely accusing a person of sexual assault is nearly as despicable as sexual assault itself. It inflicts psychic, familial, reputational and professional harms that can last a lifetime. This is nothing to sneer at. The second moment, connected to the first: “Boo hoo hoo. Brett Kavanaugh is not a victim.” That’s the title of a column in the Los Angeles Times, which suggests that the possibility of Kavanaugh’s innocence is “infinitesimal.” Yet false allegations of rape, while relatively rare, are at least five times as common as false accusations of other types of crime, according to academic literature. Since when did the possibility of innocence become, for today’s liberals, something to wave off with an archly unfeeling “boo hoo”? A third moment, connected to the second: Listening to Cory Booker explain on Tuesday that “ultimately” it doesn’t matter if Kavanaugh is “guilty or innocent,” because “enough questions” had been raised that it was time to “move on to another candidate.” "

1993,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. A new study came out this week looking at children’s life outcomes from virtually every neighborhood across the country. Based on tax and census records, the study followed people born in the early 1980s into their 30s. The central goal was to figure out what distinguished low-income neighborhoods where large numbers of children escaped poverty from neighborhoods where people remained mired in poverty. Before I get into the results, I want to ask you to take a minute and try to guess: Which economic and social indicators do you think were the strongest predictors of the life outcomes of a neighborhood’s children? If you have a moment to spare, I encourage you to think it over before reading the next paragraph … Perhaps not surprisingly, the single biggest predictor was income itself. In neighborhoods with the lowest mean household income, children who grew up poor were particularly likely to remain poor as adults. Deep poverty begets poverty. Other statistically significant predictors — in roughly descending order — included: the neighborhood’s share of residents with college degrees; the employment rate; the share of black residents; the share of Hispanic residents; third-grade math test scores; and population density (with denser neighborhoods being worse). But I’ve left off one major item from this list, and I’m curious to see whether you noticed. In fact, I left off the second largest correlation, trailing only mean household income. "
1994,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Los Angeles has over the years provided the backdrop for all sorts of television shows and movies: Westerns, science fiction, war movies and cops-and-robbers. In recent weeks, a corner of the county has been transformed into something else: the state of Iowa in the midst of a presidential campaign. The cast and crew of “Veep” have descended upon the San Fernando Valley to film episodes of the final season of the HBO series. Its main character, Selina Meyer, played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, is making a bid for the presidency; and what road to the White House doesn’t lead through Des Moines? (No spoiler alerts here because — well, we don’t know what happens next season.) Among the locations: the Underwood Family Farms in Moorpark, which has been tricked up to look like a fair. “They already had a bunch of animals and farm stuff like giant pumpkins, and we added a few rides, as well as games and deep-fried foods on a stick,” said David Mandel, the executive producer of “Veep,” whose lively Instagram feed has been offering a running chronicle of the adventure. With its scrubby hills and mountains, Los Angeles — particularly the San Fernando Valley and the Santa Monica Mountains — has easily lent itself to shows like “Gunsmoke,” “Bonanza,” “Batman” and “M*A*S*H.” But Iowa? Mr. Mandel said it wasn’t hard to make Los Angeles look like Iowa, “as long as you don’t see palm trees or the mountains.” He said the director of the show, Morgan Sackett, is from Iowa and had a decided idea on exactly how things should look. For those who haven’t been, the Iowa State Fair is one of the great pleasures of Des Moines, and it is an inevitable stop for political candidates from both parties. It is big and sprawling. "

President Trump’s tweets are already an inescapable late-night obsession. So when he bypassed Twitter and sent a message directly to people’s cellphones on Wednesday, testing a new emergency presidential alert system, the hosts couldn’t look away. Jimmy Kimmel interrupted his show multiple times with a loud alarm, as faux presidential alerts flashed across the screen. The first of them: “Someone get me five Diet Cokes.” The second: “Recycling is gay.” Then Kimmel showed the trailer for a mock horror film, based on Trump’s stream-of-consciousness siege on Americans’ cellphones. Stephen Colbert said he was happy to see a CNN report revealing that Vincent Favale, a senior vice president of talent at CBS, had been accused of using homophobic and sexually explicit language in the workplace. Favale was placed on leave Wednesday. He worked with Colbert on “The Late Show” until last year, and on Wednesday night — without mentioning Favale’s name directly — Colbert explained that some of his colleagues had complained about Favale’s behavior to the human resources department.

1997,"One has to wonder whether Russia’s military hackers want to be exposed, given how often they are. Or are these bungled operations just the tip of the iceberg? On Thursday, the United States, Britain and the Netherlands produced a stunning array of accusations against officers of the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence service, for cyberattacks involving antidoping agencies, political campaigns, chemical warfare labs and the downing of a passenger jet. The coordinated revelations about GRU hacking over the past three years confirmed the many reports that have already emerged about a Russian cyberwarfare program working overtime under fanciful names such as BadRabbit, Fancy Bear or Voodoo Bear to push Russia’s agendas abroad — mostly by trying to control the damage from embarrassing revelations about botched Kremlin operations. In Washington, the Justice Department announced the indictment of seven GRU officers for a series of cyberattacks, including efforts to hack into antidoping agencies in the United States, Canada and elsewhere, in an apparent attempt to stymie their investigations into Russia’s systematic doping of its athletes. Three of those named were previously charged by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, with hacking into Democratic Party servers. Dutch officials, meanwhile, revealed a Russian attempt in April to hack into the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in the Netherlands, which at the time was investigating the nerve agent used in the attempted assassination by the GRU of a GRU double agent in Britain, Sergei Skripal. The Dutch caught and threw out four Russian GRU agents — noting that they were also behind an attack to hack a Swiss lab involved in the inquiry. Britain, for its part, released a report on GRU cyberattacks that disclosed an attempted hack on the Foreign Office and gave more evidence of GRU involvement in the leak of Democratic emails in 2016. "
1998,"WASHINGTON — For years, Ivan Savvidis has been the Kremlin’s man in Greece. A Greek-Russian billionaire, a former member of the Russian Duma and the owner of a professional Greek soccer team, Mr. Savvidis has moved seamlessly between the sporting worlds of both countries. He has a finger in seemingly every facet of life in Thessaloniki, the Greek port city where he lives, and is a well-known player in the often feuding world of Greek and Russian oligarchs. All of which has made him of intense interest to American spy agencies. United States officials say they intercepted communications in June showing that Mr. Savvidis was working as Russia’s conduit to undermine an agreement between Greece and Macedonia that would have paved the way for Macedonia to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Greece has long objected to Macedonia’s entry into NATO. Moscow, which sees the expanding alliance as a major threat on its border, was determined to defeat a referendum on the deal. In retaliation, American officials made an unusually aggressive move: They turned over the intercepts to the left-leaning Greek government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. The Greek government responded by making a rare break with Moscow, expelling two Russian diplomats from Athens and barring the entry of two more. American spies and diplomats remain elated. Although a referendum vote last month in Macedonia on the agreement was inconclusive — the Macedonian Parliament must now decide, perhaps as early as this week, whether the country joins the Atlantic alliance — American officials see the exposure of Mr. Savvidis and the expulsion of the diplomats as a rare victory in a catch-up effort against Russian disinformation campaigns in Europe and the United States. “We’re pushing back and showing that we can play hardball too,” said Christopher R. Hill, a former United States ambassador to Macedonia. “We can tattletale, we can do things that maybe in the past we did not do.” "
1999,"“With all due respect, I don’t get confused,” Nikki Haley, the United Nations ambassador, memorably once snapped to a reporter, after a senior — and, unsurprisingly, male — White House official attributed a tough position she’d announced on sanctioning Russia to “momentary confusion.” While Ms. Haley might not have gotten confused herself, she could at times present a confusing picture. She could talk as bluntly as the president himself about the failings of the United Nations system, and yet, more quietly, she proved a practitioner of multilateral diplomacy. In an administration that prizes lock-step loyalty, Ms. Haley managed to hold to at least some of her own priorities, and as a result she appears to be that rarest of Trump appointees: one who can exit the administration with her dignity largely intact. She announced on Tuesday that she would step down at the end of the year. Ms. Haley, who is expected to pursue the presidency one day, may eventually find herself having to defend facilitating some of President Trump’s worst policies and instincts. But she will also be able to point to more constructive roles she played. Indeed, a replacement in her mold may be the best to hope for from Mr. Trump. While Mr. Trump’s America First policy is a harsh rejection of multilateralism, many United Nations diplomats valued Ms. Haley as a pragmatic envoy who could explain the president to a world confused by the chaos in Washington. She also developed a good relationship with António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, and helped avoid what could have been a breakdown between the United States and the United Nations. "
2000,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — The men and women stood, waiting, for the tardy governor of Florida on Tuesday morning. No one sought to seize Rick Scott’s bully pulpit at the State Emergency Operations Center. Ahead of a hurricane, no one could. Mr. Scott is perhaps the most predictable part of perilous weather in this state: a ballcap-wearing, statistic-rattling, always moving fount of tightly worded statements and measured worry. But as the famously scripted governor campaigns for a seat in the United States Senate, Hurricane Michael is delivering a high-stakes meteorological surprise that is testing his government’s mettle and allowing him to dominate the airwaves more than just about anyone who is not a weather forecaster. The storm, expected to make landfall as a Category 4 hurricane on Wednesday, less than four weeks before statewide elections, presents opportunities and hazards for Mr. Scott and a host of other candidates eager to display competence and gravitas as voters make up their minds and begin casting their ballots. How they tackle the preparations and response to the storm could cement their standing as front-runners — or upend months of painstaking campaign work, rendered useless by the late-arriving taint of a botched disaster. [Read here for live updates on Hurricane Michael’s path and impact.] “It’s a chance to show leadership, but it’s also a chance to fail at leadership,” said former Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina, who faced a hurricane about a month before the election he lost in 2016. “People are observing the littlest of things — how you dress, how you pronounce things, your passion, your empathy — and you’re being evaluated moment by moment.” In Florida, the scrutiny will be bipartisan. There is Mr. Scott, a Republican in his second term who is challenging Senator Bill Nelson, one of the state’s most prominent Democrats. Meanwhile, Mayor Andrew Gillum of Tallahassee, the Democratic nominee for governor, is seeking to outrun criticism of his handling of Hurricane Hermine, a 2016 storm that left city residents without power for days and was inspiring attack ads against Mr. Gillum even before Hurricane Michael appeared. "
2001,"COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa — President Trump stepped up his attacks on Democrats on Tuesday night as he sought to paint them as the party of “unhinged” and “wacko” radicals who should not be trusted with control of Congress. At a boisterous rally, Mr. Trump returned to the campaign trail for a victory lap after hosting a ceremonial swearing-in of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh at the White House, and he made clear that he will use the confirmation fight as a rallying cry in the remaining weeks before the midterm elections. Supporters cheered exuberantly at the mention of Justice Kavanaugh’s name. Pointing to the opposition to Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual misconduct by women who knew him in high school and college, Mr. Trump said that Democrats had become “totally unhinged,” and he cited a series of them by name as the audience booed. “The Democrats have become too extreme and, frankly, they’ve become too dangerous to govern,” he said. “They’ve gone wacko.” The president’s evolving campaign stump speech is part of a concerted Republican effort in recent days to recast the protests over Justice Kavanaugh as the actions of an “angry left-wing mob.” In effect, Mr. Trump and his allies are trying to paint his opposition in the same light that he has been painted during his time on the national stage. A former aide recently wrote a kiss-and-tell book about Mr. Trump titled “Unhinged,” and others have privately questioned his mental stability. By turning the tables, Mr. Trump hopes to give supporters reason to turn out on Nov. 6 even as most polls show Democrats likely to pick up seats in the House and possibly, though less likely, in the Senate. The Democrats, he said, were not merely wrong on policy, but were practitioners of the “politics of anger, division and destruction.” [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping the 2018 elections with our new politics newsletter.] "
2002,"In the end, the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford delayed — but did not derail — the confirmation of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. But the leaders of the #MeToo movement want her to know that her “sacrifice was not made in vain.” In an open letter to Dr. Blasey on Wednesday, they called her a “hero” and promised that her words would have a lasting impact. “The result of your testimony runs deeper and wider than who sits on that court seat,” the letter said. “You showed a world of discounted people what courage looks like.” The letter was signed by Tarana Burke, who founded the #MeToo movement over a decade ago; Amanda de Cadenet, the founder and chief executive of Girlgaze, a digital network to promote female photographers, directors and other creators; Glennon Doyle, an activist, philanthropist and author of “Love Warrior”; and Tracee Ellis Ross and America Ferrera, actresses and activists who have been vocal about the #MeToo movement and related causes. The letter, which was provided to The New York Times, published on the movement’s website Wednesday morning. It is only the latest step in an effort that began when Ms. Burke founded the movement over a decade ago. "
2003,"SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea said on Wednesday that it was considering lifting a sweeping embargo on bilateral trade and exchanges with North Korea, despite Washington’s efforts to keep the economic noose on the North until it denuclearizes. South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, has dangled large investment and joint economic projects as an incentive for the North to bargain away its nuclear weapons. But he has vowed to honor United Nations sanctions and refrain from significant economic cooperation with the North unless it starts denuclearizing. On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha suggested that South Korea was becoming increasingly willing to ease its own sanctions against the North in order to encourage its denuclearization. Her comments did not apply to the broad sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council. “We are reviewing it with related government agencies,” Ms. Kang said during a parliamentary hearing when a senior governing-party legislator asked her whether South Korea was willing to lift sanctions imposed in 2010. Officials cautioned that even if South Korea lifted its own sanctions, there was no way for it to foster economic relations with the North significantly because it had to abide by the United Nations limits. Many of South Korea’s sanctions against the North are already duplicated by United Nations ones, so lifting them would be merely symbolic, they said. Any premature easing of penalties is bound to face a backlash from conservative South Koreans, who fear it could undermine their country’s alliance with the United States. "
2004,"LEXINGTON, Ky. — Heather Trump is certain of one thing about the midterm election: She cannot wait until it is over. She will no longer have to hear the negative campaign ads that have become the inescapable white noise in her life. The race for Kentucky’s Sixth Congressional District between the Republican incumbent, Andy Barr, and his Democratic challenger, Amy McGrath, has featured one of the highest concentration of political ads in the country — almost 7,000 airings — in one of the most fiercely fought races. But there is a twist. The contest also has one of the most lopsided ratios of negative-to-positive ads, with Mr. Barr and aligned Republican groups spending more than $3 million in the relatively inexpensive Lexington media market in the past six weeks, overwhelmingly on spots attacking Ms. McGrath. Ms. McGrath, so far, has not run attack ads against Mr. Barr, an approach that makes this contest a laboratory to test the long-held proposition that while voters find negative ads distasteful, candidates use them because they work. “Voters universally decry negative ads,” said Erika Franklin Fowler, the director of the Wesleyan Media Project, which analyzes political advertising. “But we are biologically attuned to pay more attention to negative information. It is the same reason that loud sounds or other things will draw our attention. We remember negativity more.” "
2005,"LOS ANGELES — It has the highest concentration of billionaires in the country. It exports more computers than any other state. It is the nation’s largest producer of agriculture products by far: More than $6 billion in dairy products alone last year. California is an economic powerhouse — now the fifth largest economy in the world after surpassing the United Kingdom in total output this year. But this state may be facing a financial reckoning at the very moment that Jerry Brown is stepping down as governor: a possible recession coinciding with deepening concerns about its fiscal stability. His two potential successors — Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor, and John Cox, a Republican business executive — have significantly less experience than Mr. Brown, a fixture in California for nearly a half a century and through five national recessions. California is now on the verge of putting one of the world’s largest economies in the hands of a relatively untested governor. The ability of Mr. Brown’s successor to navigate California through challenging fiscal times could be critical to assuring both the state’s continuing economic durability and its outsize contribution to national prosperity. “So goes California, so goes the U.S.,” said Christopher Thornberg, the founding partner of Beacon Economics, a consulting firm in Los Angeles. “It is far and away a dominant source of job growth in the U.S.” "
2006,"WASHINGTON — As tanks, artillery and combat troops streamed from Russia into Ukraine in 2014, the United States government dispatched a multiagency team of technical experts to Kiev to help the fragile government there shore up its energy supply for the coming winter. The head of that team, William N. Bryan, was a career civil servant with an expertise in energy infrastructure and security. But he was a neophyte when it came to the notoriously factional and corrupt world of Ukrainian politics. And it was not long before American and Ukrainian government officials began raising concerns that he was being co-opted by a Ukrainian company seen as aligned with a prominent oligarch — concerns that grew when Mr. Bryan later joined a consulting firm that pursued business proposals with the company. Now, four years later, those relationships are attracting new scrutiny as Mr. Bryan awaits a Senate confirmation vote to become President Trump’s homeland security under secretary for science and technology. Mr. Bryan said he followed all the rules and made very little money from the private business with Ukrainian entities. But his case is the latest to highlight growing concerns about foreign influence on American politics and government, not least from wealthy, powerful Ukrainian interests. And it focuses new attention on the employment designation granted to Mr. Bryan by the Obama administration for part of his tenure in Ukraine, that of “special government employee,” a status that allows high-level officials to maintain outside employment. "
2007,"I
n early June, the Washington office of Representative Pramila Jayapal began to hear rumors about the women. They had crossed into Texas, where Border Patrol officers promptly arrested them. But now the women were somewhere around Seattle, the city Jayapal represents. Her staff made calls. Usually, undocumented immigrants in the area were held at the Northwest Detention Center, a private facility operated under a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But the detention center had not received the women. There were too many of them for ICE to house. Instead, as Jayapal learned on June 7, the mothers were now inmates at a Bureau of Prisons facility near the Seattle-Tacoma airport. Jayapal flew home to Seattle the following night. She showed up at the federal prison the next morning and was escorted to the three pods where the new inmates were held. There were 174 women. Many of them had come to the United States with their children, some as young as 5. A majority were from the violence-racked Central American countries El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras; others had traveled from as far as China and the Democratic Republic of Congo. All of them sought asylum. Some of them, after crossing the Rio Grande, spent their first night in the United States shivering in their damp clothes on Mylar sheets in the sprawling processing center in McAllen, Tex., nicknamed the hielera, or icebox. But at least their children had been with them. Now they were gone. The immigration authorities would not say where the children had been taken or when they would be returned. As part of the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy, several thousand children were being separated from their parents at the border — a tactic that previous administrations had avoided and that the mothers could not have anticipated. Meanwhile, the 174 women, having been denied initial interviews to determine whether their asylum claims merited their protection under international law, were instead piled onto airplanes and flown to the Pacific Northwest, where they were given slips of paper with their children’s names on them. Jayapal sat and listened to the women for nearly three hours. Then, outside the prison, she spoke into an aide’s video camera. After vowing to help return the separated children to their parents, Jayapal set her sights on ICE. “I am going to do everything I can in my power,” she said, “to stop funding a rogue agency at the Department of Homeland Security.” Of the 535 current members of Congress, only 12 are immigrants, and Jayapal is one of them. The first Indian-American woman to be elected to the House, Jayapal, who is now 53, came to the United States at age 16, unaccompanied and on a student visa — not to flee chaos but to attend great universities (Georgetown and Northwestern) and then make a comfortable living (first by executing leveraged buyouts at PaineWebber on Wall Street and then by selling heart defibrillators out of Cincinnati). She left the private sector in 1991 to work for nonprofits, and in 2001, a year after becoming an American citizen, she became an immigration rights organizer. She developed a reputation for her fierce intelligence, energy and media savvy — and appetite for the national stage. She was elected to Congress as a Democrat on the same night that Donald Trump won the presidency. "
2008,"With control of Congress at stake in next month’s midterm elections, Democrats have a rare opportunity to gain a foothold against President Trump’s Republican Party. But if they come up short, it may be in part because of a failure to pursue a key group of voters. It’s a constituency that makes up 13 percent of the voting population, enjoys high voter turnout and is especially concentrated in some decisive swing states. That group is military veterans — and in the battle for their votes, the Democratic Party lags far behind the Republicans. According to organizers on both sides of the contest, the Democratic National Committee seems to be pursuing a strategy that focuses on running veterans as candidates instead of organizing to reach veteran voters — the D.N.C. tried that approach more than a decade ago, and it didn’t work. In the 2006 midterm elections, Democrats positioned their party as a check against an increasingly unpopular Republican president whose decision to invade Iraq and Afghanistan had worn thin with much of the United States electorate. The D.N.C. established the Veterans and Military Families Council, hoping to drum up support from military members who had seen enough of these wars. No longer, Democrats argued, would their party be pigeonholed as indifferent to the plight of service members. The council coordinated voter outreach in military communities and advanced dozens of veterans as candidates in contentious midterm battles and nicknamed them the “Fighting Dems.” Democratic opposition to the Bush administration’s wars resonated with voters, who put them in control of Congress for the first time in more than a decade. It was the most sweeping Democratic wave since Watergate, but one of the Democrats’ key missions remained unaccomplished: Only six of the 49 Fighting Dems won their elections. Even though voters had favored Democratic candidates by an average margin of nearly 12 points in opinion polls, the military veterans running as Republican candidates, both challengers and incumbents, collectively saw higher vote shares than the Democrats’ heavily promoted veterans. Twelve years after the first corps of Fighting Dems was routed, Democrats appear poised for another blue wave. The party is investing millions in organizing what the D.N.C. chairman, Tom Perez, calls “base communities” — a diverse mix of rural whites, ethnic minorities and young people of the sort that vaulted Barack Obama to the presidency in 2008. The D.N.C. is partnering with some new grass-roots organizing groups, and Perez has pledged that the party would build up state-party infrastructures, hire full-time organizers and hold events in churches, on college campuses and in other public spaces in base communities year-round. But this investment does not include any focus on reaching veterans. D.N.C. staffers instead contend that the party’s broader messages will filter into military and veteran voting blocs. Top Democratic Party leadership “doesn’t call us for anything,” says Terron Sims II, an Iraq War veteran and vice chair for recruitment on the D.N.C.’s Veterans and Military Families Council. Working as an unpaid volunteer, Sims connects campaigns with organizers of veterans across the country. Sims and at least one other council member have sought a formal meeting with Perez for more than a year to highlight their organizing potential and warn of Republican efforts to mobilize veterans. He says their requests have been ignored. "
2009,"How do you feel about celebrities who are outspoken about their political views? Do you think famous people should voice their opinions about politics, or stay out of them? Why?

2010,"Dark circles formed like warning signs beneath Yu Fen Wang’s eyes as she worked 12-hour graveyard shifts in a Queens maternity center that operated on the margins of legality. Her family said she had grown gaunt, could not sleep and told her husband she no longer wanted to live. Her employers, however, said they needed her to work. And her family needed the money. She earned less than $100 a day, they said, working in a private house that had been converted into a combined nursery and hotel for newborn babies and their mothers. An open secret in the Flushing community, the center was part of an underground industry catering to a demanding clientele: local mothers resting after childbirth and Chinese visitors coming to have their babies in the United States, a practice known as “birth tourism.” On Sept. 21, at 3:40 a.m., these dangers collided to near-fatal effect when, the police say, Mrs. Wang stabbed three babies sleeping in bassinets on the first floor — all girls — and two adults. She then turned the knife on her own neck and wrists. The victims all survived. But the horrific act turned a spotlight on a pocket of immigrant New York, where a loose network of businesses tend to mothers and infants in the crucial, fragile month after childbirth but operate without any government oversight. The center, Mei Xin Care, is one of dozens in the area that vary widely in amenities and quality, leaving workers with few avenues for complaint, and families with little to guide them other than word of mouth, internet advertisements and blind trust. “There are victims at all sides of the spectrum,” said Assemblyman Ron Kim, a Democrat who represents Queens. "
2011,"Good Wednesday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today. • Nikki R. Haley, ambassador to the United Nations, said she would resign at the end of the year, representing a high-profile departure by one of the few women in the president’s cabinet. Read the story. • American national security agencies gave Greece evidence of an attempt by Russia to undermine a Greek agreement with Macedonia that would pave for way for Macedonian membership in NATO. The evidence prompted Greece to expel two Russian diplomats. • Hurricane Michael arrives at the height of campaign season in Florida, and Gov. Rick Scott, who is running for the Senate, is in heavy public service mode. The hurricane could be an opportunity to show his leadership skills, or it could give opponents a new avenue of attack. • “We wish you a long and happy career in our common calling,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said in welcoming Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to his first day of Supreme Court arguments on Tuesday. The light tone was a stark contrast to the fierce battle over his confirmation. • Republicans in races across the country hope the uproar in the Supreme Court has unified their voters in a way their party hasn’t seen in the last decade. But will it come at a cost? • While the Kavanaugh hearings may have been a reminder of the Supreme Court’s past, the new justice has already established a first in the history of the court: An all-female class of law clerks. • Farmers, automakers and other businesses are feeling pain from the president’s steel and aluminum tariffs, which remain in place despite a revised North American Free Trade Agreement. Read the story. • A county in New Jersey sent out thousands of mail ballots for the midterm elections with erroneous address information. But not to worry — the ballots will still count. • Beto O’Rourke, the Democrat challenging Senator Ted Cruz in a tight race in Texas, may benefit from a group of unusual supporters: white evangelical women. • On Sunday, Taylor Swift urged her 112 million Instagram followers to register to vote. According to officials at Vote.org, it appears that many of her fans did just that. Read the story. _____________________ Today’s On Politics briefing was compiled by Margaret Kramer in New York.

2012,"For the latest hurricane coverage, read Thursday’s live updates. PANAMA CITY, Fla. — Hurricane Michael charged through Florida and into Georgia on Wednesday, lashing the Panhandle with rains and heavy winds. Water raced in from the sea, flooding the streets and leaving at least one person dead. The storm whipsawed trees, blew away large chunks of fencing and bent stop signs almost parallel to the ground. Videos posted to social media showed a tapestry of damage near a marina in Mexico Beach: waterlogged homes, flying debris, splintered wood. But it was impossible to gauge the full extent of the carnage because the waters, already topping some buildings whose roofs just peeked through, were still rising. “This is the worst storm that our Florida Panhandle has seen in a century,” Gov. Rick Scott warned. Just about every update seemed to bring greater grimness: closed bridges, more towering waves, suspended emergency services, admonitions that the time to evacuate had passed. The hurricane center reported a 130-mile-per-hour wind gust near the evacuated Tyndall Air Force Base — and said that the measuring instrument had then failed. Here’s the latest: • The storm made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane near Mexico Beach, Fla., around midday on Wednesday, with 155 mile-per-hour winds. By 2 a.m. Thursday, the storm was 25 miles east of Macon, Ga., and had lost strength, with maximum winds of 60 m.p.h. At midnight, it was downgraded to a tropical storm. • Michael is moving north quickly, around 20 m.p.h., and is expected to maintain its speed as it crosses Georgia. Forecasters then expect it to speed up as it continues northeastward across the Carolinas through late Thursday, and then move off the Mid-Atlantic coast by early Friday. Click on the map below to see the storm’s projected path. "
2013,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A sudden resignation at the White House, a Russian plot in Macedonia and an unusual invitation from North Korea. Here’s the latest: • Fatigue. That’s a reason cited by Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., in announcing she would resign at the end of the year, according to people close to her. White House staff were caught off guard. People familiar with her thinking say she aims to make some money in the private sector. “It was a blessing to go into the U.N. with body armor every day and defend America,” she said, with President Trump in the Oval Office, above. Mr. Trump said that she had let him know months ago, and that he’d name her replacement in coming weeks. He said he had five candidates in mind, and even discussed the possibility of nominating his daughter Ivanka. Ms. Haley, who was one of the few women in the cabinet, was an outspoken envoy for the U.S. and a popular figure in Washington, but she had collided recently with the national security adviser, John Bolton. She has also long been considered a potential presidential candidate — but she insists she isn’t running in 2020. Our interactive plots the unprecedented staff turnover within the Trump administration. _____ "
2014,"As Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last month, women across the country took to the streets and social media in support of her and sexual assault survivors around the world. Two of them were teenage girls — seniors at the high school Dr. Blasey attended in the 1980s —  who shared a ticket to the hearing, silently alternating in and out of a seat at the back of the hearing room. It was a show of solidarity that spoke volumes about the moment we’re living in. Those two teenagers are part of a generation of girls who’ve been at the helm of some of the most transformative social movements in recent memory. Take look at this list, and you’ll see what I mean: Emma González, a graduate of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and Naomi Wadler, who organized a walkout of her Virginia elementary school, made headlines as advocates for gun control at ages 18 and 11. The Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman became a force in the #MeToo movement at 23, when she revealed that she had been abused by the team doctor. As a sixth grader, Marley Dias started a campaign to promote and share books featuring black girls. Mari Copeny has been the face of the fight for clean water in Flint, Mich., since she was 8. Sophie Cruz was just 6 when she spoke at the Women’s March about immigration reform. Jasilyn Charger, at 21, coordinated a 2,000-mile run from North Dakota to Washington to raise awareness about the impact of the Dakota Access Pipeline on Standing Rock. And beyond these headline-grabbing female activists is an entire cohort — whether you call them Gen Z or post-millennials or simply “young” — who seem to have eclipsed their male counterparts in political participation. "
2015,"As Hurricane Michael rips through homes and communities, we send our sympathies to all those in its path, but let’s also review what some leading Florida residents have said about climate change. “One of the most preposterous hoaxes in the history of the planet,” scoffed Rush Limbaugh of Palm Beach. Gov. Rick Scott’s administration went so far as to bar some agencies from even using the term “climate change,” according to the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting (Scott denied this). Myopic Floridians have plenty of company. President Trump dismissed climate change as a hoax “created by and for the Chinese.” Senator James Inhofe, a Republican of Oklahoma, “disproved” climate change by taking a snowball onto the Senate floor and noting that it was chilly outside; using similarly rigorous scientific methods, he wrote a book about climate change called “The Greatest Hoax.” [Nicholas Kristof answered your questions about his column as well as the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi on Facebook and Twitter.] Alas, denying climate change doesn’t actually prevent it. North Carolina passed a law in 2012 prohibiting the use of climate science in certain state planning, yet that didn’t intimidate Hurricane Florence last month. And banning the words “climate change” isn’t helping Florida now. Some folks will say this isn’t the moment for politics. But don’t we have a responsibility to mitigate the next disaster? "
2016,"China has yet to give any details of the corruption charges against Meng Hongwei, the president of Interpol, who disappeared on a visit home and was later said to have been arrested. Whatever the charges are, they are almost certainly not the real reason for his fate. In China, the law is what the Communist Party says it is — more precisely, what President Xi Jinping says it is. And when an official of Mr. Meng’s global stature is nabbed, it’s a political decision — even if, coincidentally, he was corrupt, as is often the case in China. Mr. Meng understood the rules of that game. He had been a vice minister of public security in a police state and had played a role in many operations, including Operation Fox Hunt, which tried to bring Chinese officials and businesspeople suspected of corruption back from abroad. His former boss, Zhou Yongkang, was imprisoned for life on corruption charges in 2015. Mr. Meng’s last WhatsApp message to his wife was an emoji of a knife, which she understood to mean he was in danger. Interpol has asked Beijing for an explanation for Mr. Meng’s detention but has taken no further action. The agency issued a statement on Sunday that it had accepted his resignation as president “with immediate effect” and named a replacement. Whatever else he was, Mr. Meng was the president of Interpol, a venerable international organization based in France that facilitates cooperation among police forces from its 192 member countries. The position of president is largely ceremonial — a secretary general, currently Jürgen Stock of Germany, runs day-to-day operations. But the selection of a Chinese official for the post was a major feather in China’s cap, proudly hailed by Mr. Xi a year ago as evidence that China “abided by international rules.” The crude arrest of Mr. Meng proclaims the opposite. China’s behavior puts it more closely in a league with Russia, another nation whose authoritarian leader is convinced that his country is due global respect and deference by virtue of its wealth and might, and not its actions. It’s a perception seemingly shared by President Trump in his fondness for strong, unaccountable leaders and his America First approach to foreign policy. "
2017,"With less than a month until Election Day, it’s time for Democrats to hunker down and get serious about their midterm messaging. In the dispiriting aftermath of the recent Supreme Court confirmation circus, this means taking a couple of deep breaths, not flipping out over the Republicans’ purported “Kavanaugh bounce” (which might be more of a hiccup) and focusing on a few key issues that resonate with a broad swath of voters. Republicans are twitchy about their electoral prospects. They know that midterm elections tend to go poorly for the party that holds the White House, just as they are aware that President Trump, while beloved by the base, has a popularity problem among the wider electorate. Party leaders are going all in with the culture-warring and scaremongering, looking to drive their voters to the polls with the specter of a wild-eyed, rage-filled Democratic “mob” hellbent on destroying the Republic. In a Wednesday op-ed in USA Today, the president himself indulged in some light red-baiting, claiming that “radical socialist” Democrats want to turn America into Venezuela. The entire screed was classic Trump: unhinged, breathtakingly dishonest and aimed squarely at making the opposition’s head explode. As part of this base-stroking, Republicans are eager to keep the debate raging over their freshly confirmed, ultra-polarizing Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh. The brutal fight to seat Justice Kavanaugh, which morphed from an inquiry into the judicial fitness of one man into a culture-war cage match over women’s rights and shifting sexual mores, electrified many left-leaning voters. But it also stirred up die-hard Republicans, potentially endangering the “enthusiasm gap” Democrats had been enjoying. With Justice Kavanaugh now safely tucked into his lifetime appointment, there’s much less cause for conservatives to stay angry. And even if they’re stewing today, or next weekend, three-plus weeks is an eternity in politics — all the more in a political climate dominated by this endlessly dramatic White House. Thus, we see prominent Republicans, including the Senate majority leader and the head of the Republican National Committee, peddling the idea that if Democrats gain power in Congress, one of their top priorities will be to impeach Justice Kavanaugh. No matter that this claim has no factual basis — it plays perfectly to the Republican base’s enduring sense of victimhood. Which is why Democrats must resist the urge to follow Republicans down this spider hole, or that of any radioactive topic designed to inflame partisan passions. Thankfully, Democratic leaders in both chambers of Congress seem to recognize this and are encouraging their members to pivot toward issues aimed at bringing more people into the fold. In the Senate, they have said they will fixate on health care in the coming weeks, with special attention paid to protections for people with pre-existing conditions. This is a wildly popular provision of Obamacare, and one on which Republicans know they are vulnerable. This explains why President Trump fibbed about having fulfilled a campaign vow to protect coverage for pre-existing conditions, when in reality his administration has refused to defend such protections. Every single Democratic candidate should be laboring to make sure that every single American voter knows this. "
2018,"ERIE, Pa. — When President Trump mocked a Democratic senator at a midterm election rally the other night, the crowd responded with one of his supporters’ favorite chants from his own campaign two years ago. “Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!” The arena boomed with shouting voices and they kept going. “Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!” Mr. Trump smiled and soaked it in. Then he assailed the Democrats for becoming “an angry left-wing mob.” From the pot-and-kettle department of politics, the president is trying to turn the tables on his opponents this fall. A master of divide-and-conquer campaigning who gives critics belittling nicknames, calls his foes “evil people” and has encouraged supporters to “knock the crap” out of protesters, Mr. Trump hopes to convince the public that his opponents are the ones who are “totally unhinged.” The raw and raucous battle over the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh has given Mr. Trump and his Republican allies a new target to motivate their conservative base to turn out in the elections less than four weeks away. The women who confronted senators in elevators with stories of sexual assault and the demonstrators who protested in the Senate chamber or outside the Capitol are at Mr. Trump’s rallies now part of a leftist cabal, a dangerous rabble. “The Democrats have become too extreme,” Mr. Trump said at a rally on Tuesday in Council Bluffs, Iowa. “And they’ve become, frankly, too dangerous to govern. They’ve gone wacko.” Democrats, he added, are practicing the “politics of anger, division and destruction.” In Erie on Wednesday night, he again warned about the “radical Democrat mob.” Mr. Trump has often engaged in what some analysts call projection, describing his opponents in the same terms they use to describe him. While his own mental stability has been questioned, Mr. Trump regularly calls his foes “crazy,” “psycho,” “wacky” and “mentally deranged.” Just weeks after a former aide published a book about him titled “Unhinged,” he applied the same word to Democrats. "
2019,"So, it appears the Republican Senate candidate in Ohio flew to a meeting of “faith leaders” in a plane owned by a Cleveland strip club owner. I am telling you this just to cheer you up. The world of politics has been pretty fraught lately, and today we’re going to try to be cheery, and just talk about good old-fashioned weirdness and stupidity. Such as Representative Jim Renacci’s decision to travel to campaign events — including a “meet & greet … with local faith leaders” — in a plane owned by the proprietor of the Peek-a-Boo club in Cleveland. The congressman said the owner, who we will call Mr. Peek, is a campaign volunteer. “I’m not going to vet volunteers,” Renacci told an Ohio news site. Well, we would hope that all our candidates do a little bit of vetting when it comes to air safety. But the best thing about this story is that it has nothing whatsoever to do with Donald Trump. Who recently suggested that when we’re contemplating the coming elections we should “think of it as the same thing as me.” O.K., he’s probably right. But that doesn’t mean we don’t deserve a little political diversion. For instance, you’ve probably heard about Representative Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican, who is a heavy favorite for re-election even though he’s been the subject of an attack ad made by six of his siblings. “It’s intervention time, and intervention time means … you go to vote Paul out,” says one brother in the ad for Gosar’s opponent, which is titled “A Family Defends Its Honor.” I can’t tell you this has really made a difference; the polls suggest Gosar is still going to win. However, it could be a useful citation during your next family argument. (“Well, at least I never made an attack ad against you!”) "
2020,"PANAMA CITY, Fla. — Hurricane Michael, one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the continental United States, slammed into the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday, unleashing a trail of destruction across 200 miles that splintered houses, peeled off roofs and stirred up a terrifying surge of seawater that submerged entire neighborhoods and sent boats careening down city streets. A storm that was initially forecast to arrive as a tropical storm instead amped up to furious intensity, hitting landfall just after midday near the small seaside community of Mexico Beach, 100 miles southwest of Tallahassee, with winds topping 155 miles per hour. Images from there showed swaths of shattered debris where houses once stood and structures inundated up to their rooftops; the streets of Panama City, farther west, were blocked by downed tree limbs and impossible tangles of power lines. Recreational vehicles, trucks and even trains were pushed over, surrounded by new lakes of water. [For the latest updates, read our Hurricane Michael live briefing] “Hurricane Michael is the worst storm that the Florida Panhandle has ever seen,” said Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, where 375,000 people were ordered evacuated from the western part of the state. The storm was officially classified as a Category 4 — on the verge of Category 5 — but weakened as it continued its rapid advance up toward Georgia and the Carolinas, where cities still reeling from Hurricane Florence prepared for another onslaught of rain and wind. It was downgraded to a tropical storm at midnight on Wednesday. Just about every update seemed to bring greater grimness: closed bridges, more towering waves, suspended emergency services, admonitions that the time to evacuate had passed. The National Hurricane Center reported a 130-mile-per-hour wind gust near the evacuated Tyndall Air Force Base — and said that the measuring instrument had then failed. "
2021,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. After hearing about the dire report that United Nations climate scientists released on Monday, Jimmy Kimmel said that the world looked like it was almost ready to close up shop. Ever the absurdist, he cued up a wacky going-out-of-business ad for all of Earth. “One planet’s calamity is another planet’s shop-portunity,” Kimmel said. Then the ad’s caffeinated announcer took over. “Attention, galaxy: Planet Earth is going out of business!” he said. “We’ve lost our minds, and everything — must — go! Insane deals on everything on Earth.” Trevor Noah, too, ruefully made light of the United Nations report, which said the most drastic effects of climate change could become irreversible within the next 12 years. "
2022,"MANILA — Through controversy after controversy, President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has always been able to count on his appeal among the nation’s poor. But soaring prices for staples like rice are starting to alienate that vital base of support. During his presidency, Mr. Duterte has clashed with cherished institutions like the Roman Catholic Church, made jokes about rape and led a brutal war on drugs that has left thousands dead. But he now faces deepening discontent in an area that particularly affects the urban poor: the price of food. The country’s inflation rate has hit a nine-year record — 6.7 percent — after climbing for nine consecutive months, the Philippine Statistics Authority said last week. That situation is bad enough that on Tuesday Mr. Duterte ordered restrictions dropped on the importing of rice, ending a decades-old protectionist policy administered by the country’s National Food Authority. Over the past year, vegetable prices have gone up nearly 20 percent, fish prices 12 percent and meat prices 7 percent. And while global rice prices have been stable, prices in the Philippines have been as high as double the import price. “Five hundred pesos feels like one peso now,” said Lilian Gomez, 52, for whom it doesn’t take long these days to hit her budget limit at the Agora market in Manila. “All the prices have gone up since Duterte became president.” "
2023,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: Hurricane Michael strengthened into a Category 4 storm overnight and is expected to make landfall in Florida today as the fiercest tropical cyclone to hit the mainland U.S. this year. We have live updates here. Emergency declarations have been issued for parts of Alabama, Florida and Georgia, and the authorities ordered tens of thousands to evacuate. “This is the worst storm that our Florida Panhandle has seen in a century,” Gov. Rick Scott of Florida warned. After striking Florida, Michael is expected to veer northeast through Georgia and the Carolinas before heading into the Atlantic on Thursday night. We’re tracking the storm’s projected path here. • Political winds: The hurricane arrives less than four weeks before statewide elections in Florida, and the candidates’ response could make or break their standing. • Stark forecast: After a recent U.N. report on climate change, there is a strong sense that urgent action is needed. With a new round of negotiations set for December, the next months will be crucial. "
2024,"Prognosticators are wildly confused about which “side” will benefit from the highly contentious process around Brett Kavanaugh. Whose anger will prevail? they ask. On the left, some ask, what’s the point? Nothing matters, it is all stacked against us now and forever. Unions are deeply familiar with this reality. Workers who have managed to win National Labor Relations Board elections are up against seriously rigged rules that strongly favor management. They face highly motivated, well-resourced “union avoidance firms” that deploy any means possible to prevent workers from organizing. This same billionaire class, including some of the very same funders behind the Federalist Society’s list of judges handed to their populist front — the president — first perfected warfare against workplace democracy, i.e., unions. Billionaires unleashed these methods and machinery against American democracy in the midterms of 2010 and 2014, culminating in the 2016 national election. Because the very tactics long used against workers in workplace elections have now been exported to the broader electoral arena, it’s important to understand three lessons about how to win by those of us who continue to achieve victory even when faced with a ruthless, break-all-the-rules, determined opposition. First, even though one side needs only a simple majority of those who vote, workers who want to succeed must try to build supermajority participation and support (75 percent) to stand a chance on Election Day. Rather than approaching a unionization election that assumes we need only a 1 to 3 percent edge to win, experienced union organizers know that in the final weeks leading up to the election, union avoidance consultants will unleash a blitzkrieg to drastically reduce the numbers of pro-union voters by persuading them to vote against their interests or, even more effectively, to simply stay home on voting day. They have a name for this: “futility.” Through all platforms available, they hammer away the message that no matter whether workers show up or don’t show up to vote, nothing will ever change. Futility is a strategy. An indispensable aspect of this is to make people associate the unionization election itself with the pain and discomfort of the polarized, harsh language coming at them from all sides: The sooner the election goes away, the better they will feel. Things will return to “normal,” since they will stop fighting with friends and family, and the once-bad normal — the reason for the struggle in the first place — suddenly feels better, until their employer cuts benefits weeks after the election. Futility makes the act of voting, discussing and even thinking about the election feel bad. A persistent refrain in the fall of 2016 was “I can’t wait till this thing is over already.” Making Americans want to make the election (democracy) “just go away” is a main tactic of the futility strategy. Second, you must build supermajority participation, because, as the election approaches, the opposition will succeed at stripping support from a key percentage of previous yes voters. All effort must be focused on what successful union organizers call “going to the biggest-worst”: spending all our time with workers who are undecided or leaning anti-union. The biggest mistake inexperienced union organizers make is spending precious time preaching to the choir, i.e., talking to pro-union activists. "
2025,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] With the confirmation battle of Justice Brett Kavanaugh finally over, we got a preview of our political future. Spoiler alert: It’s exhausting. A whole lot of Democrats are meeting voters, campaigning in key states, posing for photos with some of the buzziest midterm candidates, and definitely, most certainly, under absolutely no circumstances RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. Our fearless leader Patrick Healy, The Times’s politics editor, says this week reminds him of a moment in everyone’s favorite musical, “Hamilton.” Right after Alexander Hamilton finishes a quiet ballad about his son’s death, Thomas Jefferson jumps onto the stage. “Can we get back to politics?” he whines. Then it’s off to the election of 1800. (Can you tell Pat used to cover theater?) "
2026,"The 2016 election is almost two years behind us, but arguments over why Donald Trump won haven’t stopped. Because Mr. Trump drew support from white voters with less formal education — the “white working class” — many attributed his victory to Americans’ economic anxiety. But this narrative has obscured the true nature of Mr. Trump’s coalition. On the whole, Trump voters were never extraordinarily economically distressed. And now the economically distressed are actually less likely to approve of Mr. Trump’s performance as president. Traditional ways of measuring people’s views of the economy often suffer from partisan bias: People are more likely to say that the economy is doing better when their party controls the White House. For example, immediately after Mr. Trump’s election, and well before he could do anything to affect the economy, the percentage of Republicans who said the economy was getting better increased from 15 percent in October 2016 to 80 percent in February 2017, according to Gallup polls. Over the same time period, Democrats became less favorable about the economy. To avoid this issue, we asked a set of different questions in the May 2018 Views of the Electorate Research Survey, a project of the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group. A sample of 6,000 Americans told us whether they had experienced a variety of negative financial events over the last year — including a drop in income, a job loss, or difficulty paying monthly bills. They also reported whether they had savings and felt financially prepared for the unexpected, as well as their overall feelings about their finances, job, income, savings and debt. Answers to these questions were only weakly associated with people’s identity as Democrats or Republicans and therefore better captured their true economic situation. The results showed that minorities of Americans reported an acute economic struggle in the previous year. Eight percent said they or their spouse had lost a job. The percentage who had difficulty making a payment for their mortgage or other major expenses ranged between 7 and 14 percent. A larger fraction expressed concern about their economic situation. About one in five were somewhat or very dissatisfied with their income and 25 percent reported a drop in their income in the previous year. Savings were a real concern: 33 percent said that they did not have any savings and 40 percent were dissatisfied with their savings. Nearly half (47 percent) said that they were not very or not at all financially prepared for the unexpected. "
2027,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. The Khashoggi plot thickens, a tragedy exposes Chinese birth tourism, plants send tailored messages to animals. Here’s what you need to know: • A top forensics expert. An air force lieutenant. The men were among 15 Saudi operatives who Turkish authorities said flew to Istanbul to pursue the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Many on the list have close ties to Saudi leadership, including to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Turkish officials said the men killed Mr. Khashoggi, pictured above entering the Saudi Consulate, dismembered his body using a bone saw and carried him out of the building — all on the orders of the Saudi royal court. The Saudi government vehemently denies the allegations. The men’s identities were the latest details to leak from Turkey’s investigation, adding to international pressure on Saudi Arabia. _____ • A Chinese spy is extradited to the U.S. A Chinese intelligence officer, Yanjun Xu, was arrested in Belgium and handed over to the U.S. where he is accused of trying to steal trade secrets from GE Aviation. "
2028,"WASHINGTON — A Chinese intelligence official was arrested in Belgium and extradited to the United States to face espionage charges, Justice Department officials said on Wednesday, a major escalation of the Trump administration’s effort to crack down on Chinese spying. The extradition on Tuesday of the officer, Yanjun Xu, a deputy division director in China’s main spy agency, the Ministry of State Security, is the first time that a Chinese intelligence official has been brought to the United States to be prosecuted and tried in open court. Law enforcement officials said that Mr. Xu tried to steal trade secrets from companies including GE Aviation outside Cincinnati, in Evendale, Ohio, one of the world’s top jet engine suppliers for commercial and military aircraft. A 16-page indictment details what appears to be a dramatic international sting operation to lure Mr. Xu to what he believed was a meeting in Belgium to obtain proprietary information about jet fan blade designs from a GE Aviation employee, only to be met by Belgian authorities and put on a plane to the United States. China has for years used spycraft and cyberattacks to steal American corporate, academic and military information to bolster its growing economic power and political influence. But apprehending an accused Chinese spy — all others charged by the United States government are still at large — is an extraordinary development and a sign of the Trump administration’s continued crackdown on the Chinese theft of trade secrets. The administration also outlined on Wednesday new restrictions on foreign investment aimed at keeping China from gaining access to American companies. The arrest of Mr. Xu “shows that federal law enforcement authorities can not only detect and disrupt such espionage, but can also catch its perpetrators,” Benjamin C. Glassman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, said in a statement. "
2029,"WASHINGTON — A Supreme Court argument on Wednesday over the detention of immigrants during deportation proceedings seemed to expose a divide between President Trump’s two appointees, Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh. The question in the case was whether the federal authorities must detain immigrants who had committed crimes, often minor ones, no matter how long ago they were released from criminal custody. Justice Kavanaugh said a 1996 federal law required detention even years later, without an opportunity for a bail hearing. “What was really going through Congress’s mind in 1996 was harshness on this topic,” he said. But Justice Gorsuch suggested that mandatory detentions of immigrants long after they completed their sentences could be problematic. “Is there any limit on the government’s power?” he asked. Justice Stephen G. Breyer pressed the point, asking a lawyer for the federal government whether it could detain “a person 50 years later, who is on his death bed, after stealing some bus transfers” without a bail hearing “even though in this country a triple ax murderer is given a bail hearing.” The lawyer, Zachary D. Tripp, hedged, and Justice Gorsuch grew frustrated. “Mr. Tripp, we’re quibbling,” Justice Gorsuch said. “Justice Breyer’s question is my question, and I really wish you’d answer it.” Mr. Tripp eventually responded, “This applies regardless of time.” He added that Congress had intended that harsh result. "
2030,"Stocks suffered their steepest drop in eight months on Wednesday, as rising interest rates gnawed at investors and as previously high-flying technology shares tumbled in the face of growing tensions with China. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 3.3 percent, registering its fifth consecutive daily decline. That’s the longest string of down days for the S.&P. 500, the market’s benchmark, since November 2016. The damage continued on Thursday in Asia, as markets in China, Japan and Hong Kong fell about 3 percent in morning trading. The decline signaled a change in mood on Wall Street. For months, it had seemed as though nothing could spook stock investors in the United States. Growing corporate profits and surging shares of technology giants pushed major benchmarks to a string of record highs. But concerns about nascent inflation, rising interest rates and the potential for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy came together into a wave of selling Wednesday. In addition, President Trump’s policies toward Beijing have become a drag on technology companies, which rely heavily on China as a manufacturing base. Shares of the companies that make components like semiconductors have been particularly hard hit in the recent selling. Apple shares, for example, slid over 4.5 percent on Wednesday. “It looks as though Trump is settling most of the trade skirmishes around the world that he started earlier this year with one important exception,” said Ed Yardeni, president of the stock market research firm Yardeni Research. “It looks like China is going to be a long-term issue.” In recent days, interest rates on government bonds — which serve as a baseline for mortgages and other loans — have climbed to levels last seen in 2011, and that’s making them a key concern for stock market investors.

2031,"WASHINGTON — Authorized hackers were quickly able to seize control of weapons systems being acquired by the American military in a test of the Pentagon’s digital vulnerabilities, according to a new and blistering government review. The report by the Government Accountability Office concluded that many of the weapons, or the systems that control them, could be neutralized within hours. In many cases, the military teams developing or testing the systems were oblivious to the hacking. A public version of the study, published on Tuesday, deleted all names and descriptions of which systems were attacked so the report could be published without tipping off American adversaries about the vulnerabilities. Congress is receiving the classified version of the report, which specifies which among the $1.6 trillion in weapons systems that the Pentagon is acquiring from defense contractors were affected. But even the declassified review painted a terrifying picture of weaknesses in a range of emerging weapons, from new generations of missiles and aircraft to prototypes of new delivery systems for nuclear weapons. “In one case, the test team took control of the operators’ terminals,” the report said. “They could see, in real time, what the operators were seeing on their screens and could manipulate the system” — a technique reminiscent of what Russian hackers did to a Ukrainian power grid two years ago. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, described “red team” hackers who were pitted against cyberdefenders at the Pentagon. The tested weapons were among a total of 86 weapons systems under development; many were penetrated either through easy-to-crack passwords, or because they had few protections against “insiders” working on elements of the programs.

2032,"To the Editor: Re “Nikki Haley Will Be Missed” (editorial, Oct. 10): As your editorial notes, Ms. Haley, the United Nations ambassador, “has been the face of misguided and cruel Trump initiatives” that have seriously eroded America’s standing in the world. So because she’s simply a right-winger who has been complicit with President Trump most of the time and not an intolerant, inept ideologue like most of the appointees who follow Mr. Trump’s orders all of the time, she will be missed? It’s really disappointing how low the standards have gotten for evaluating the performance of cabinet members in this administration. Lloyd Trufelman
Katonah, N.Y. To the Editor: Ambassador Nikki Haley has so much to recommend her: intelligence, competence, a strong personality. Whether she will escape the moral taint of having enabled a dishonest and immoral president is another question. I know that I have a long memory and am not likely to forgive. George M. Lewis

2033,"WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, defended the bureau’s handling of an abbreviated background check into Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, telling lawmakers on Wednesday that agents acted properly amid criticism that they should have more thoroughly investigated sexual assault allegations against him. As part of a dramatic deal to move Justice Kavanaugh’s nomination forward in the Senate two weeks ago, the White House directed the F.B.I. to conduct a narrow investigation that was “specific in scope,” Mr. Wray told members of the Senate Homeland Security Committee during a hearing. “That is consistent with the standard process for such investigations going back quite a long ways,” he said. Mr. Wray’s remarks were his first public comments about the F.B.I.’s role in the background investigation, and he treaded carefully. Confirmed 14 months ago to replace the fired James B. Comey, Mr. Wray has tried to keep the F.B.I. out of the cross hairs of President Trump, who has relentlessly attacked the Justice Department’s investigation into Russia’s election interference and whether any Trump associates conspired. The hearing thrust Mr. Wray into a difficult spot. If he said the F.B.I. could have done more but was limited by the White House, Mr. Wray might have been seen as criticizing the president or confirming Democratic accusations that the White House was uninterested in a close examination of the allegations against Justice Kavanaugh. If Mr. Wray said the F.B.I. had opted on its own not to conduct additional interviews, he would have opened the bureau to intense criticism. "
2034,"WASHINGTON — The F.B.I.’s former top lawyer told congressional officials in private testimony last week that he had taken seriously a suggestion by the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, to secretly tape conversations with President Trump but viewed it as too risky and unlikely to deliver meaningful information. F.B.I. officials dismissed the idea within days, according to James A. Baker, then the bureau’s general counsel, but his testimony shows that F.B.I. leaders played out its potential ramifications before rejecting it. Mr. Baker’s account contradicts Mr. Rosenstein’s denial of a New York Times article last month that said he suggested recording the president and discussed recruiting cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump from office. It also undermines an assertion provided by the Justice Department from a law enforcement official present on one of the occasions when Mr. Rosenstein broached the idea of taping Mr. Trump and said he was being sarcastic. [Read: Rod Rosenstein Suggested Secretly Recording Trump and Discussed 25th Amendment] Mr. Baker said that he learned of Mr. Rosenstein’s suggestion of wearing a wire into the Oval Office not long after he made it, either from Andrew G. McCabe, the acting F.B.I. director at the time, or a senior bureau lawyer, Lisa Page. Legal concerns aside, Mr. Baker testified, the approach made little practical sense to him and he never conducted a formal legal analysis. Mr. Baker said he was also aware that Mr. Rosenstein discussed invoking the 25th Amendment. Three congressional officials described Mr. Baker’s testimony, requesting anonymity to discuss the private interview. People familiar with Mr. Baker’s actions in the chaotic days after Mr. Trump abruptly fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director in May 2017 also corroborated his account. A lawyer for Mr. Baker declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for Mr. McCabe, who was fired from the F.B.I. in March. Asked for comment, a Justice Department spokesman referred back to Mr. Rosenstein’s statement from September. Fox News and The Washington Post first reported details of Mr. Baker’s testimony. "
2035,"To the Editor: “On Africa Trip Featuring Good Will, Melania Trump Reveals Her Inner Trump” (news article, Oct. 8) quotes Melania Trump as saying she wishes people “would focus on what I do, not what I wear.” One of the things you do, Mrs. Trump, is wear attire that sends blatant, offensive signals when you know your image will be displayed worldwide (for example, the “I Really Don’t Care.

2036,"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. It’s been a big week for climate science. My colleague Coral Davenport, who spent the past week in Korea nailing down the findings of a landmark report from the United Nations scientific panel on climate change, writes that the immediate consequences of global warming are more dire than previously thought. The report describes a strong risk of crisis as early as 2040. At current levels of warming, which stand around 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1.0 degree Celsius) above preindustrial levels, the planet is already seeing more intense forest fires, coral bleaching, storm surges and crop failures. Things will get far worse, the report found, if the warming reaches 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius). That, unfortunately, is the course we’re on. This piece by Brad Plumer and Nadja Popovich helps visualize how critical that half-degree Celsius can be. Despite the scientists’ call to action, Coral and Mark Landler report, the response from the White House was muted, with President Trump saying Tuesday evening only that he “will be looking at it.” Since the Trump administration has systematically worked to discredit climate science and dismantle regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it fit a pattern. And yet Coral noted something significant: Despite its stance on climate science, the Trump administration formally approved the document. In the world of diplomacy, it sends a signal that even the Trump administration might not be willing to publicly buck the conclusions of the world’s top climate scientists. "
2037,"Scrolling down the list of my primary care patients, I wondered who might be affected. A pregnant woman from Cameroon. An elderly woman with brittle bones from the Dominican Republic. A man with cancer from Ecuador. The Trump administration’s proposal to deny green card status to people who use services like food assistance and Medicaid threaten several of my patients with a harrowing choice: their health, or their immigration status. A “public charge” is someone that the United States deems likely to be primarily dependent on the federal government for subsistence. The government can prevent public charges from adjusting their status from a visa category (such as work visa) to a legal permanent resident (green card holders). Immigrants thus have strong incentives to avoid this designation. Historically, the government has designated as public charges only those immigrants who receive cash assistance from programs like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families in amounts that represent more than half of their personal income. But the new rule proposed by the Department of Homeland Security — which is expected to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday and opened to a 60-day public comment period — significantly broadens that set of programs. If the proposed rule is adopted, programs that are crucial for my patients’ health, including Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (once known as food stamps), housing assistance and Medicare Part D (the prescription drug benefit), would all count toward the designation of a public charge. Accordingly, my pregnant patient from Cameroon may have to decide whether becoming a permanent resident is more important than providing her unborn child with the nutrients required to live a long life. My patient from the Dominican Republic may have to decide whether becoming a permanent resident is more important than taking the medication that will strengthen her bones and prevent a hip fracture. "
2038,"WASHINGTON — A 28-year-old California man was sentenced to six months in prison on Wednesday for selling bank account information that helped Russia wage a social media campaign aimed at influencing and disrupting the 2016 presidential race. The man, Richard Pinedo, was the third defendant to be sentenced in the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russia’s election interference and whether any Trump associates conspired. He was also ordered to serve six months of home detention after his time in prison. Mr. Pinedo was an unknowing participant in Russia’s scheme to use Facebook and other social media platforms to exploit political divisions among American voters and swing the election in favor of President Trump. The Russians, whose bogus Facebook pages reached hundreds of millions of Americans, paid at least some of their expenses through PayPal accounts that were set up using stolen bank account information from Mr. Pinedo. Mr. Pinedo pleaded guilty in February to one count of identity fraud and provided evidence that figured in the indictment of 13 Russians and three Russian companies. But while prosecutors acknowledged that his assistance saved them time, they refused to ask the judge to lighten his sentence because of it. Sentencing guidelines recommend a 12- to 18-month prison term for his crime. Lawrence Atkinson, a prosecutor on Mr. Mueller’s team, told the judge that Mr. Pinedo did not substantially advance their inquiry because investigators had already identified his Russian customers by the time they confronted him. Jeremy I. Lessem, Mr. Pinedo’s lawyer, said afterward that he was disappointed that prosecutors made no plea for leniency given Mr. Pinedo’s cooperation. “This is a difficult pill for him to swallow,” he said. “Any custody at all was more than we were hoping for.” "

__________ A presidential run by Howard Schultz may be a double-edged sword for Starbucks investors. The retired founder of the $78 billion coffee chain is widely expected to challenge Donald Trump for the presidency in 2020. Die-hard Starbucks customers might like to see the man who is responsible for their morning caffeine enter the political fray. But the company’s domestic growth will come from Republican states. In the end, Mr. Schultz for president may just be a flat zero for the stock. Credit Bill Ackman for putting the issue front and center for investors. The founder of the Pershing Square hedge fund revealed on Tuesday that his firm has bought 15 million shares, worth some $870 million at current prices, with a view to a “doppio” — or double, in Italian. The stock has been unloved by the market, Mr. Ackman said, because Wall Street is overly obsessed with same-store sales. As a result, the shares fetch around $58 a piece today, about the same as three years ago. Mr. Ackman’s bullish presentation at a conference held by the financial markets publication Grant’s Interest Rate Observer was underpinned by a conviction that Kevin Johnson, the chief executive of Starbucks, has taken the right steps to increase sales at existing United States outlets, including combating a slump in sales of its famous Frappuccino drinks. At the same time, Mr. Ackman showed a map of the United States where, despite having 14,000 outlets, the company has little penetration in the Midwest and South. Most of those areas are Republican. The risk is that by taking on Mr. Trump and the G.O.P. in states where Starbucks has little business, Mr. Schultz might become a liability to the company’s expansion plans. America is already deeply divided over far lesser things than the taste — and provider — of their coffee. A liberal campaign by Mr. Schultz may be just what rival Dunkin’ needs to take its brand beyond New England. But there’s a benefit, too, in Mr. Schultz entering politics. As Mr. Ackman pointed out, the idea that the Starbucks founder might occupy the Oval Office could offer the company protection from retaliation by Chinese authorities: “The last thing the Chinese would do is go after the next American president’s company.” Blending those two effects suggests that, for Mr. Ackman and other investors, Mr. Schultz’s effect on the stock may be a wash. "
2040,"During the swearing-in of Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Monday, Donald Trump took it upon himself to apologize to Kavanaugh and his family “on behalf of our nation” for the “terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure.” He repeated the tired lines that he and Republicans hope will stick, and steer the comatose base to electoral fervor: That accusations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh were part of a “campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception” and that “what happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness, decency and due process.” But to me, this was not just a president and party worried about an approaching “blue wave” and trying to take political advantage of a moment of victory. It was also an outright and increasing amplification of a reactionary white male victimization syndrome that has consumed modern American conservatism. Vox has called it “the unleashing of white male backlash.” The women accusing the white man of assault weren’t the victims; instead, the white man was the victim. In some people’s eyes, he was the victim of political correctness, #MeToo’s overreach, a check-your-white-male-privilege culture drunk on its own self-righteousness. During Kavanaugh’s hearings, Lindsey Graham had the temerity to say, “I’m a single white male from South Carolina, and I’m told I should shut up.” The evocation of his white maleness in his argument was an overt shot at the check-your-privilege crowd. "
2041,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said on Wednesday that it would more aggressively police foreign investment in the United States, outlining a rigorous review system that is aimed primarily at preventing China from gaining access to sensitive American technology. The investment restrictions will allow the United States to block a far wider array of foreign transactions that are deemed a threat to national security, including minority stakes and joint ventures in technology, telecommunications and other cutting-edge companies. While Congress passed the expanded review system into law this summer, the administration signaled that it would apply its new authority very broadly and would review any foreign transaction involving a business that designs or produces technology related to 27 industries, including telecom, semiconductors and computers. Foreign investors will be required to submit declarations notifying the panel of their intentions when making a bid and could be assessed a fine up to the value of the transaction if they fail to comply. The toughened investment regime will apply to all countries but is aimed largely at China, which President Trump has accused of trying to gain access to valuable American technology through nefarious means. The White House has criticized China for trying to obtain trade secrets by investing in United States companies, pressuring domestic firms doing business in China to hand over intellectual property and committing outright cyberespionage. On Wednesday, a Chinese intelligence official was arrested in Belgium and brought to the United States to face espionage charges, further escalating the China crackdown. Law enforcement officials said the official tried to steal trade secrets from GE Aviation. The administration has already taken several steps to stop Beijing from harnessing American technology in critical sectors, such as the next generation of 5G wireless technology, and to thwart China’s strategic plan to dominate cutting-edge industries, known as Made in China 2025. It has imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods as a form of punishment and has threatened to tax all Chinese imports if Beijing does not change its trade practices. "
2042,"Good Wednesday. Want this by email? Sign up here. The long-struggling retailer could file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as soon as this week, the WSJ reported, citing unidentified sources. Earlier yesterday, Sears announced that Alan Carr, an expert in financial restructuring, had joined its board. But the WSJ reports that the company could file for bankruptcy before Monday, when $134 million in debt comes due. This isn’t surprising. Sears has lost $11 billion since 2011; sales have dropped 60 percent over the same period; and it has closed hundreds of stores. Its C.E.O., Eddie Lampert, has sold off businesses to raise cash, but critics argue that he has strip-mined the company. Filing for bankruptcy is risky for retailers, as doing so tends to send customers and suppliers fleeing, making it hard to recover. There’s no reason to think Sears would fare any differently. The nearly $100 billion investment fund is in talks to buy a majority stake in WeWork for at least $15 billion, according to the WSJ and Recode. If that happens, it would mean SoftBank has invested almost a quarter of its fund in the real estate company that hopes to become a tech giant. "

2045,"Michael R. Bloomberg, the Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-independent, says he is returning to his roots: He has re-registered as a Democrat — an initial but essential step toward a possible run for president in 2020 as a Democrat. Mr. Bloomberg made the announcement in simultaneous social media postings on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, which showed the left-handed 76-year-old filing out his registration paperwork (and also, incidentally, the absence of his middle “R” initial). “At key points in U.S. history, one of the two parties has served as a bulwark against those who threaten our Constitution,” Mr. Bloomberg wrote, adding later, “We need Democrats to provide the checks and balance our nation so badly needs.” Mr. Bloomberg had abandoned the Democratic Party to launch his political career in 2001 and win the mayoralty in New York City as a Republican. But he noted on Wednesday that he had been a Democrat “for most of my life.” He ended nearly two decades of estrangement, inspired by what he said was the call of history and the need for an opposition party to provide on a check on President Trump.

2047,"WASHINGTON — For President Trump, who has made Saudi Arabia the fulcrum of his Middle East policy, the possible murder of a Saudi journalist in Turkey is a looming diplomatic crisis. For Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, it is a personal reckoning. More than anyone in the Trump administration, Mr. Kushner has cultivated Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman — whose family may have played a role in the disappearance of the journalist, Jamal Khashoggi — elevating the prince into a key ally in the Arab world and the White House’s primary interlocutor to the kingdom. Mr. Kushner championed Prince Mohammed, 33, when the prince was jockeying to be his father’s heir; had dinner with him in Washington and Riyadh, the Saudi capital; promoted a $110 billion weapons sale to his military; and once even hoped that the future king would put a Saudi stamp of approval on his Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. While the fate of Mr. Khashoggi, a resident of Virginia and a columnist for The Washington Post, remains unclear, allegations that he was killed on the orders of the royal court have thrown Mr. Kushner’s grand bet on Prince Mohammed into doubt. He may be less the risk-taking reformer the Trump family eagerly embraced than a reckless, untested ruler, who critics say has been emboldened by his ties to the Trumps to take heavy-handed actions at home and abroad. American intelligence agencies have collected communications intercepts of Saudi officials discussing a plan to lure Mr. Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia from his home in Virginia and then detain him, according to a former senior American official. "
2048,"WASHINGTON — President Trump signed bipartisan legislation on Wednesday that would free pharmacists to tell consumers when they could actually save money by paying the full cash price for prescription drugs rather than using health insurance with large co-payments, deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. The legislation on gag clauses has been praised by lawmakers in both parties, but the signing was nearly eclipsed on Wednesday by a separate health care furor: Mr. Trump asserted in an essay in USA Today that Democrats supporting “Medicare for All” would wreck the program for older Americans, infuriating Democrats who said he was lying to millions of Americans. “Democrats would gut Medicare with their planned government takeover of American health care,” Mr. Trump said, and he assailed Democrats as “radical socialists.” The back-and-forth over health care showed how prominent the issue has become in the midterm election campaigns. As the parties were coming together on prescription drug costs and fighting over Medicare, the Senate deadlocked on Wednesday over a Democratic proposal to block the expansion of cheap “short term” health insurance policies that do not have to cover maternity care or pre-existing conditions, a top priority of Mr. Trump’s. Democrats, hoping to regain control of the Senate, had pushed for the vote to put Republicans on the record as opposing protections for people with pre-existing conditions. “The Trump administration has expanded junk insurance plans,” said Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, who led the effort. “These plans are cheap for a reason. They do not have to provide essential health benefits like hospitalization, prescription drugs and maternity care.” "
2049,"Do you remember political spin? Politicians used to deceive voters by describing their policies in misleading ways. For example, the Bush administration was prone to things like claiming that tax breaks for the wealthy were really all about helping seniors — because extremely rich Americans tend to be quite old. But Republicans no longer bother with deceptive presentations of facts. Instead, they just flat-out lie. What do they lie about? Lots of things, from crowd sizes to immigrant crime, from steel plants to the Supreme Court. But right now the most intense, coordinated effort at deception involves health care — an issue where Republicans are lying nonstop about both their own position and that of Democrats. The true Republican position on health care has been clear and consistent for decades: The party hates, just hates, the idea of government action to make essential health care available to all citizens, regardless of income or medical history. This hatred very much includes hatred of Medicare. Way back in 1961, Ronald Reagan warned that enacting Medicare would destroy American freedom. Maybe it’s just me, but I don’t think that happened. Newt Gingrich shut down the government in an attempt to force Bill Clinton to slash Medicare funding. Paul Ryan proposed ending Medicare as we know it and replacing it with inadequate vouchers to be applied to the purchase of private insurance. And the hatred obviously extends to the Affordable Care Act. Republicans don’t just hate the subsidies that help people buy insurance; they also hate the regulations that prevent insurers from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions. Indeed, 20 Republican state attorneys general filed a lawsuit trying to eliminate protection for pre-existing conditions, and the Trump administration has declined to oppose the suit, in effect endorsing it. "
2050,"ANKARA, Turkey — President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has long cast himself as a champion of the Arab Spring uprisings and the political Islamists who once seemed poised to ride them to power. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia anchors the opposite camp in an ideological battle raging across the Middle East: the anti-Islamist strongmen who quashed the revolts. The two leaders, each the head of a major regional power, have until now kept their relations cordial in the interest of stability. But over the past week, tensions between them have erupted over the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist who vanished after entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul nine days ago. Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly challenged Saudi Arabia to explain Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance, while Turkish officials say they have video and audio evidence proving he was killed, and have unleashed a stream of leaks suggesting that the royal court ordered it. The crown prince and his spokesmen have insisted, without providing evidence, that Mr. Khashoggi left the consulate freely, professing that they, too, are worried about him. The dispute pits two staunch, headstrong nationalists against each other — both with ambitions to reshape their region. They also share an aversion to public criticism and a history of refusing to back down from a fight. "

hen should public resources be used for a particular interest group? Who gets to choose and how can decisions for the few be countered by the many? Questions like these rose to a shout in Australia this week, from culture to science to academia. It’s always risky to connect such disparate subjects — each has its own context. But as I write from cold, quiet Canberra, I think it’s worth recognizing that a number of recent public debates have all included something vital for democracy: a moment of grass-roots awakening. At a time when apathy is on the rise, this was a week of engagement and lively argument about national and international affairs. Let’s go through a few examples and why they stood out. • Whose House? Our House The fight over whether the sails of the Opera House should be used to advertise for the Everest horse race brought out thousands of protesters who insisted that Australia’s most famous building not be used as a billboard for gambling. We had a reporter in the crowd.

2052,"— in an interview with “Fox & Friends” on Thursday — in an opinion piece published in USA Today on Wednesday — in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, referring to Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont and a leading proponent of “Medicare for all.” Mr. Trump’s warning that “Medicare for all” would lead the United States to experience a crumbling economy, political turmoil and food and medicine shortages as in Venezuela is without merit. That country’s health care system “played a minimal role in Venezuela’s epic crisis,” said Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College whose research focuses on Latin America. Instead, Mr. Corrales said, the main culprits were the government’s mismanagement of the economy, soaring deficits, declining oil production, debts racked up by the state oil company, and price controls. The New York Times’ Interpreter column has also detailed how decades of corruption and political strife exacerbated the national economic crisis. There is no evidence that any of that is the result of adopting a single-payer health care system. Mr. Trump’s assertion that countries with single-payer systems are “disasters” is contradicted by the fact that many advanced economies have such systems. "

2054,"Robert Pitofsky, who as chairman of the Federal Trade Commission in the Clinton administration advocated stricter enforcement of competition and greater protection for consumers, died on Oct. 6 at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 88. The cause was complications of Alzheimer’s disease, his son David said. Mr. Pitofsky was a leading figure in competition law. An antitrust scholar and a former dean of the Georgetown University law school, he wove in and out of government, private law practice and academia over his career. President Bill Clinton appointed Mr. Pitofsky to head the Federal Trade Commission in 1995. At the time, it was a sleepy agency colloquially referred to as “the little old lady of Pennsylvania Avenue.” Mr. Pitofsky soon sought to call attention to the growing threat of corporate consolidation, particularly with the rise of technology. During his tenure the agency would become the central watchdog for the internet and technology industries. “There is at this agency a willingness to challenge the most powerful companies in the world, when those companies have done wrong, in the name of the less powerful,” Mr. Pitofsky said in 2001, in one of his last speeches as chairman. Mr. Pitofsky won support from consumer groups that had pushed for greater scrutiny of mergers and stronger consumer protection in matters like deceptive advertising. But he was also criticized by some free-market conservatives and antitrust lawyers, who said he was trying to expand antitrust enforcement too far. "
2055,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] The story of her mother’s death was never easy for Elissa Slotkin to tell. Ms. Slotkin and her brother had pushed their mother into reinstating her health insurance, which she had dropped after losing her job. But she let the new policy lapse, opting to pay another bill before her $1,000-per-month premium. A few weeks later, she walked into an emergency room and learned she had stage-four ovarian cancer. The same month she received her terminal diagnosis, she had to consider filing for bankruptcy. Nearly a decade later, Ms. Slotkin watched her congressman, Mike Bishop, a Republican, smiling and standing alongside the president at an event to celebrate the House passing its version of a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. “Something in me just broke,” she said. Ms. Slotkin decided to challenge Mr. Bishop for his seat in Michigan’s Eighth District. And she knew she wanted her mother’s story to be part of her campaign. What she didn’t expect was just how many people would be eager to hear it. The story has became a central theme of her campaign — she even released an ad featuring her sick mother delivering a speech at her wedding. “It was difficult at the beginning to talk about it, and then it really became this important opening for people to tell me about their lives,” she said. “When I tell the story of my mom, that is the story that the majority of people really connect to.” "
2056,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced on Thursday that it would sharply restrict exports of civilian nuclear technology to China that officials claimed was being diverted to power new generations of Chinese submarines, aircraft carriers and floating nuclear power plants. The announcement mixed security warnings with longstanding complaints that Beijing was continuing to steal nuclear-related technology from American firms to benefit Chinese state-owned companies. In a call with reporters, however, administration officials revealed little of the intelligence evidence that they said would back up their claims. The move appeared to be part of a more concerted effort by the administration to put new pressure on China beyond the tariffs that President Trump has announced on Chinese goods. On Wednesday, the Trump administration said it would impose a new review system on foreign investments to prevent adversaries — chiefly China — from obtaining new technology by taking minority stakes in American companies or starting joint ventures here. Also on Wednesday, the Justice Department announced the arrest of a Chinese intelligence officer who was charged with stealing secret information from GE Aviation, one of the largest suppliers of jet engines.

2057,"WASHINGTON — After a week of extensive interviews, repetitive rally speeches and a torrent of tweets, President Trump, a fan of a good media spectacle, temporarily ceded the glare of the spotlight on Thursday to someone even more comfortable with it: Kanye West. In a visit to the White House for what was ostensibly a working lunch to discuss work force training programs, sentencing reforms and African-American employment, Mr. West wore a “Make America Great Again” hat — an accessory he said made him feel like Superman — and delivered a 10-minute soliloquy to Mr. Trump, the news media and anyone judging his decision to support the president. “Trump is on his hero’s journey right now,” Mr. West said. “He might not have thought he’d have a crazy” person “like me,” he said, using an expletive to describe himself. In the past, Mr. West has been an outspoken critic of politicians. In 2005, he lashed out at a sitting president on live TV over his efforts to assist Hurricane Katrina victims, saying, “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.” On Thursday, a storm was still battering the East Coast, but Mr. West was busy bonding with Mr. Trump over their shared delight in subverting (and offending) crowds. Mr. West has in recent days drawn a large amount of criticism for his decision to corner the cast members of “Saturday Night Live” and deliver a pro-Trump speech off camera. Amid the backlash, Mr. West deleted his social media accounts, but found a friendly reception in the Oval Office. "
2058,"WASHINGTON — Melania Trump, the first lady, said that the reason she incorporated social media abuse into “Be Best,” her public awareness campaign on children’s issues, is that she herself is one of the world’s most high-profile victims of bullying. “I could say I’m the most bullied person on the world,” Mrs. Trump said in an interview with ABC News that was filmed during her visit to Kenya last week. When asked to clarify whether she indeed believed that, Mrs. Trump seemed to couch her reply. “One of them,” Mrs. Trump said, “if you really see what people saying about me.” As one of the most visible women in an increasingly divided country, Mrs. Trump is not exactly wrong: Each public statement she makes, whether it’s to offer words of comfort after a tragedy or to promote one of her initiatives, is met with a torrent of abuse, including hate-filled comments and racy photos from her career as a model. But her comment again put her in stark contrast with her husband, who is known to bully both adversaries and allies. And around the same time as ABC was airing her interview, the president was on Fox News publicly doing battle with his enemies. In a lengthy interview with “Fox & Friends,” his preferred morning program, Mr. Trump was asked about “the heat” he took for attending a “Make America Great Again” rally in Pennsylvania as a deadly hurricane hit Florida. “I really had very little heat other than the natural haters,” Mr. Trump said. “Relative to other things, I think it was very minor.” "
2059,"WASHINGTON — An Environmental Protection Agency panel that advises the agency’s leadership on the latest scientific information about soot in the atmosphere is not listed as continuing its work next year, an E.P.A. official said. The 20-person Particulate Matter Review Panel, made up of experts in microscopic airborne pollutants known to cause respiratory disease, is responsible for helping the agency decide what levels of pollutants are safe to breathe. Agency officials declined to say why the E.P.A. intends to stop convening the panel next year, particularly as the agency considers whether to revise air quality standards. Environmental activists criticized the move as a way for the Trump administration to avoid what they described as the panel’s lengthy but critical assessment of how much exposure to particulate matter is acceptable in the atmosphere. “To me this is part of a pattern,” said Gretchen Goldman, research director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a science-oriented environmental nonprofit. “We’re seeing E.P.A. trying to cut science out of the process.” She and others noted that the move follows other decisions at the E.P.A. they find worrisome, including eliminating a senior science advisory position and pressing for new rules that would restrict the number and type of studies the E.P.A. could consider when writing new regulations. Dr. Goldman, an environmental engineer, wrote on Twitter that the E.P.A. quietly telegraphed its latest move in a personnel announcement Wednesday. In that announcement, the E.P.A. said that a smaller, seven-person umbrella advisory board would from now on be conducting reviews of federal air standards and that the administration hoped to complete any revisions by late 2020. "
2060,"A Slovak journalist and his fiancée are shot dead in their home. A gunman storms a Maryland newsroom in a targeted attack on the staff. A writer walks into the Saudi Consulate in Turkey — and never walks out. It’s been a deadly year for journalists, analysts say, even in democratic countries where press freedom has been seen as an essential part of civil society. “Typically journalists are not murdered in the United States,” said Courtney Radsch, the advocacy director for the Committee to Protect Journalists. “Typically they are not murdered in Western Europe. Yet we have seen it this year in both — which were previously considered bastions of press freedom — that journalists are being murdered and that there is a parallel of anti-press rhetoric happening.” So far this year, at least 43 journalists have been killed around the world as a result of their work, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. That number is outpacing last year, and does not include 17 other deaths in which the motive has not been confirmed. “Certainly, in the past several years we have seen record numbers of journalists being killed,” Dr. Radsch said. "
2061,"Until markets plunged on Wednesday, the economic news couldn’t have been much better for Republicans heading into the midterm elections. Two weeks ago the Dow Jones industrial average hit a record. Last week the unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent. Economic growth estimates were just upgraded to 4.2 percent for the second quarter. President Trump hasn’t been shy about taking credit: “As large as we are, we’re the fastest-growing economy in the world, up $10 trillion,” he told the United Nations in late September, grossly exaggerating both the order and magnitude of the gains. (The United States is nowhere near the fastest-growing economy in the world, and last year it grew by $1.3 trillion, not $10 trillion.) As the White House adviser Larry Kudlow recently put it, “The single biggest story this year is an economic boom that is durable and lasting.” The problem for Republicans: If history is any guide, neither record stock prices nor a booming economy will stem the incumbent party’s losses in a congressional election. Nor should Democrats take much comfort from the possibility that the recent drop in stock prices will hurt Republicans’ standing with voters. Keith Parker, chief equity strategist at UBS, recently completed an in-depth study of all midterm-election years from 1950 to 2014. “In nearly all instances the party of a sitting president loses seats,” he concluded. “We sliced the data every way possible. A strong market going into the election doesn’t necessarily help the incumbent’s party.” Nor does a bad stock market seem to hurt it. "
2062,"To the Editor: Re “‘Unhinged’? No, Trump Tells Opponents, You Are,” by Peter Baker (White House Memo, Oct. 11): President Trump worries that the Democrats have gone “wacko,” and are practicing the “politics of anger, division and destruction.” The Senate Judiciary Committee hearings showed us anything but. Without exception, the Democratic senators maintained a tone of civility, even when Judge Brett Kavanaugh belligerently hurled back questions instead of answering them, while a Republican, Lindsey Graham, pumped the room with hysteria. The image of Senator Amy Klobuchar, who shared her own family pain with alcoholism, gently coaxing the judge with the kind of patience but firmness that a mother of a young child uses to get him to speak the truth, is forever etched in my book of civility. So, Mr. Trump, not to worry that the Democrats have gone out of control. Their behavior at the hearings was anything but that of an “angry left-wing mob.” Cathy Bernard
New York To the Editor: In his Oct. 9 Op-Ed article, “We Shouldn’t Gloat About Kavanaugh,” David Marcus suggests that Republicans should channel their more gracious instincts lest Democrats, when again in power, seek to “pack the court,” and transform it into “a third elected branch of the federal government.” I commend Mr. Marcus’s sense of propriety and empathy, but I think that train has already left the station. Richard Greif
Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. To the Editor: David Marcus states that the Supreme Court exercises its power through the faith of the American people, and that if that faith is “sufficiently shaken,” the check Americans have on elected power could be shattered. "
2063,"In an Orwellian era when the president’s personal lawyer says that “truth isn’t truth” and when lies are excused as “alternative facts,” a newly released documentary film provides a potent reminder of one public official who wasn’t afraid to speak his mind without perverting reality. The film, titled “Moynihan,” profiles Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the flamboyant, technocratic, political-clubhouse-bred and Harvard-honed four-term United States Senator from New York, United Nations ambassador and adviser to Presidents John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. Produced by Joseph Dorman and Toby Perl Freilich, the documentary is being screened this month in New York, Los Angeles and Washington. Moynihan, who died in 2003, famously said that people are entitled to their own opinions but not to their own facts. He also liked to quote the maxim that “it’s not ignorance that hurts so much as knowing all those things that ain’t so.” Which can only make you wonder how much he, as that rare commingling of politician and public intellectual, would be wincing at the categorical claims coming from Congress and the White House nowadays. Moynihan distinguished himself because he derived his policy positions from research, rather than by cherry-picking statistics to justify those policies. That’s how he propelled himself to the forefront of issues like auto safety and climate change, as well as the question of the durability of the Soviet Union. He championed equal rights and recognition for women, including his wife, Liz, whom he valued as an equal partner in a male dominated town. The product of a single-mother household, Moynihan was exploring the failure of so many recruits to qualify for the military when he more or less stumbled on the disintegration of the two-parent black family as a major cause of recurring poverty. His report on the black family was meant not for public consumption but for President Johnson, who adopted its premise in his groundbreaking strategy to go beyond equal rights to address equality of results in his “War on Poverty.” Moynihan’s conclusions were leaked, though, and became public in 1965 when America was wracked by urban riots, and the report was misinterpreted as blaming the victims. "
2064,"Dissatisfaction with President Trump among Nevada voters has not had quite the ripple effect Democrats are hoping for in the state’s highly competitive Senate race, and turnout among Hispanics for that contest in November remains a key question for the party, according to results in a New York Times/Siena College poll this week. Roughly as many Nevadans approve of Mr. Trump’s job performance as disapprove, and they are also about evenly split on the Senate candidates. In the phone survey of more than 640 registered Nevada voters, which had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, Senator Dean Heller held a slight edge over his Democratic challenger, Representative Jacky Rosen. Mr. Heller is considered the Republicans’ most endangered incumbent, in a year when his party can only afford to lose one seat and still retain its control of the Senate. “It’s still anybody’s guess,” Jon Ralston, a prominent political analyst in Nevada and the editor of The Nevada Independent, said in an email about the Senate race. Turnout, especially among nonwhite voters, is a big question for Democrats, who are particularly relying on getting a huge margin of support from Hispanic voters. But in an encouraging sign for Republicans, nearly 40 percent of Hispanics said they would vote for Mr. Heller compared with 52 percent for Ms. Rosen, according to the poll. Only 45 percent of registered Hispanic voters say they were “almost certain to vote,” compared with 63 percent of white voters, and 13 percent of Hispanic registered voters said they were “not at all likely to vote.” "
2065,"WASHINGTON — Weeks before it is to reimpose another round of punishing sanctions on Iran, the Trump administration warned the world’s banks on Thursday that Tehran might try to use duplicitous means to soften the sanctions’ bite and continue to fund terrorism. Iran’s bankers and officials have used front companies, fraudulent documents and other measures to generate revenue for the country’s terrorist activities, the administration said. “Any country that allows its central bank to be involved in deception in support of terrorism requires the highest levels of scrutiny, particularly when the country itself is the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism,” said Sigal Mandelker, the Treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. The warning is part of a coordinated campaign by the administration to persuade banks and corporations around the world to sever all commercial ties with Iran, not only because of looming American sanctions but also because it says Tehran diverts even seemingly innocuous transactions toward illicit ends. No new sanctions or penalties were announced on Thursday. President Trump announced in May that the United States was leaving the Iran nuclear deal and restoring sanctions lifted under the 2015 accord. The first set of sanctions banning transactions involving dollar bank notes, gold and other commodities went into effect in August. The next, more punishing set of sanctions banning transactions with Iran’s central bank, shipping companies and oil suppliers, is scheduled to take effect on Nov. 5. In recent months, teams of officials from the Treasury and State Departments have visited more than 30 countries to talk with not only government officials but also trade and financial organizations to lay out their case against Iran. "
2066,"SAN FRANCISCO — When Christine Blasey Ford testified before Congress last month about Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s alleged sexual assault, a website called Right Wing News sprang into action on Facebook. The conservative site, run by the blogger John Hawkins, had created a series of Facebook pages and accounts over the last year under many names, according to Facebook. After Dr. Blasey testified, Right Wing News posted several false stories about her — including the suggestion that her lawyers were being bribed by Democrats — and then used the network of Facebook pages and accounts to share the pieces so that they proliferated online quickly, social media researchers said. The result was a real-time spreading of disinformation started by Americans, for Americans. What Right Wing News did was part of a shift in the flow of online disinformation, falsehoods meant to mislead and inflame. In 2016, before the presidential election, state-backed Russian operatives exploited Facebook and Twitter to sway voters in the United States with divisive messages. Now, weeks before the midterm elections on Nov. 6, such influence campaigns are increasingly a domestic phenomenon fomented by Americans on the left and the right. “There are now well-developed networks of Americans targeting other Americans with purposefully designed manipulations,” said Molly McKew, an information warfare researcher at the New Media Frontier, a firm that studies social media. Politics has always involved shadings of the truth via whisper campaigns, direct-mail operations and negative ads bordering on untrue. What is different this time is how domestic sites are emulating the Russian strategy of 2016 by aggressively creating networks of Facebook pages and accounts — many of them fake — that make it appear as if the ideas they are promoting enjoy widespread popularity, researchers said. The activity is also happening on Twitter, they said. "
2067,"WASHINGTON — Prices for the most popular type of health insurance under the Affordable Care Act will drop slightly next year in the federal marketplace, after several years of rapid increases, the Trump administration said on Thursday. Specifically, it said, the average premium for the second-lowest-cost plans offering midlevel coverage will decline next year by 1.5 percent, the first time this benchmark has declined since the federal insurance exchange made its debut in 2014. “Though the average decrease is small, it is a dramatic and very positive change from the double-digit increases experienced over the past two years,” said Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs the online marketplace serving 39 states. From 2017 to 2018, the benchmark rose 37 percent, officials said, and in the prior year it rose 25 percent. Ms. Verma said the new numbers vindicated Trump administration policies that many health care experts say have destabilized insurance markets. “While some have publicly been accusing us of sabotage, the reality is that we have been working hard to do everything we can to mitigate the damage caused by Obamacare,” Ms. Verma said, adding, “Our actions have succeeded.” "
2068,"World War II casts a long shadow across this week’s recommended titles. Nora Krug’s “Belonging” reckons with German guilt, both nationally and individually; Kate Atkinson’s “Transcription” sets a literary spy thriller amid Nazi sympathizers in London; and Joshua Cohen’s essay collection “Attention” ponders, among other things, the legacy of the Holocaust writer A. G. Adler. The Iraq war is here, too, in Elliot Ackerman’s novel “Waiting for Eden” and (by way of the protesters in its opening novella) in Toshiki Okada’s “The End of the Moment We Had.” It’s not all war, though! We also have dystopia and prison violence and government dysfunction and grand theft dinosaur. And — just as vertiginous, in its way — experimental fiction, with Olivia Laing’s “Crudo,” a slender novel at once autobiographical and biographical that borrows liberally from the life of the counterculture icon Kathy Acker to draw searching and plangent contrasts between the domestic and the wild. Gregory Cowles
Senior Editor, Books THE FIFTH RISK, by Michael Lewis. (Norton, $26.95.) Lewis has a reputation for taking fairly arcane subjects — high finance, sovereign debt, baseball statistics, behavioral economics — and making them not just accessible but entertaining. He does the same with government bureaucracy in “The Fifth Risk,” a look at the state of crucial government agencies under the Trump administration. Lewis is “a supple and seductive storyteller,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes, “rendering even the most abstruse details of government risk assessment in the clearest (and therefore most terrifying) terms.” BELONGING: A German Reckons With History and Home, by Nora Krug. (Scribner, $30.) In her new visual memoir, Krug traces the stubborn silences in German life and investigates her own family’s role during World War II. “Belonging” takes the form of an overstuffed scrapbook, jammed with letters, photographs, official documents and fragments from journals. The book is a “mazy and ingenious reckoning with the past,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. “The notion of ‘consolation’ is one I suspect Krug would regard with suspicion. What she seems in pursuit of is a better quality of guilt.” AMERICAN PRISON: A Reporter’s Undercover Journey Into the Business of Punishment, by Shane Bauer. (Penguin Press, $28.) For his latest book, Bauer, an investigative journalist, went undercover as a guard at a private prison in Louisiana. His alarming, riveting exposé portrays a multibillion industry plagued by violence, corruption, deprivation and incompetence. “The sheer number of forehead-slapping quotes from Bauer’s superiors and fellow guards alone are worth the price of admission,” Nate Blakeslee writes in his review. “Bauer is a generous narrator with a nice ear for detail, and his colleagues come across as sympathetic characters, with a few notable exceptions.” CRUDO, by Olivia Laing. (Norton, $21.) Written with bristling intelligence, this debut novel by a British writer (whose nonfiction books include meditations on drinking and urban loneliness) pays homage to the iconoclastic author Kathy Acker, creating a pastiche of voices and identities. “Laing doesn’t try to make the case that Acker — a remarkably transgressive but also a remarkably privileged individual — is the voice best positioned to critique or represent these times,” our reviewer, Katie Kitamura, writes. “Instead, the impulse to resurrect Acker feels more personal. ‘Crudo’ begins as a piece of conceptual swagger, only to morph into something far more intimate and in some ways more exceptional.” "
